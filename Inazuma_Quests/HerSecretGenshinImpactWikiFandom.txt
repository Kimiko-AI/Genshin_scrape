 "Act to the plan, and plan to the situation"...
 "Attack where the enemy is weak, emerge where the enemy is blind"...
 (And if we did, it was all Paimon's fault.)
 Everyone was asking so much of you yesterday...
 I could sense things were getting to you.
 I'll buy you a new book on military strategy.
 Let's let her rest a while.
Media:vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05a.ogg Paimon: You sure that's a good idea?
Media:vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05a 1.ogg Paimon: Hmm, she does look pretty exhausted. Guess there's still some time to go, too. Alright, let's keep her company while she rests.
Media:vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03a.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Avoid disaster... Protect peace at all costs...
Media:vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03a 1.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: The war's over... Things are slowly getting better...
Media:vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03a 2.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Did you see...?
You take a break together with Kokomi for a while more.
Media:vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03a 3.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Uhhhh... Huh? What time is it? Did I fall asleep?
Media:vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05a 2.ogg Paimon: Yup, you've been out for ages! It's nearly time for the feast!
Media:vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03a 4.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I can't believe it got so late!
Media:vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03a 5.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: *sigh* I haven't slept that peacefully in so long. That's gotta be three whole energy points right there. Should be enough to see me through the peace talks.
Media:vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03a 6.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Thank you, (Traveler). Well, we better get ourselves over there, it's nearly time to light the bonfire.
Media:vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05a 3.ogg Paimon: Woohoo, Kokomi's back to full energy! Good to have you back!
 Let's wake her up.
Media:vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05b.ogg Paimon: We probably should, after all, she did say she wanted to wrap everything up before the feast kicks off!
Media:vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05b 1.ogg Paimon: Kokomi, wakey-wakey!
Media:vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03b.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hmmmm...? Was I asleep? ...What time is it?
Media:vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05b 2.ogg Paimon: Time to get going! It's nearly time for the feast!
Media:vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03b 1.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Really? It's that time already? Ughhhh... I still don't feel like I'm fully recharged.
 I'll buy you a new book on military strategy.
Media:vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03b 2.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Really? Yes! I want the latest volume of the Teyvat Art of War!
Media:vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03b 3.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: The Yae Publishing House published it last month, but I haven't had the chance to get my hands on it... No backing out now, okay?
Media:vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05b 3.ogg Paimon: Huh, that really perked her up.
Media:vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05b 4.ogg Paimon: Alright, let's get to the feast!
 Quest DescriptionYou have agreed to meet Kokomi near Sangonomiya Shrine. Time to move out.
 Step DescriptionThe agreed time has come and gone, but Kokomi has yet to make her appearance. You learn of here [sic] whereabouts from the guards, but you discover there is...
 Step DescriptionYou find a listless Kokomi at her secret base. Read her a favored military treatise to quickly restore her Energy.
 We saw nothing.
After some more time...
An end to this war will surely make everyone on Watatsumi Island happy, won't it?
Even I'm struggling to understand what's going on...
I'll have to write up another batch of directives tonight. Hopefully, this won't go on too late. I still need to perform an inspection tomorrow.
It seems like it will rain soon. I can only hope that the waves aren't as rough, and those who go out fishing can return safely.
Looking at their earnest faces, I can't help but think back to the time that I took up the post of Divine Priestess. Have I really lived up to their expectations all these years?
Lots of people spoke to me today again. Energy -3.
Many things must still be settled. I need to ensure that they allow the goods to flow smoothly, but I must make sure that their money is made through legal means...
Media:vo dialog xhlq003 kokomi 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ahh... I don't even want to move right now.
Media:vo dialog xhlq003 kokomi 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: It'd be so nice if all my work could just do itself without me having to lift a finger...
Media:vo dialog xhlq003 kokomi 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'm actually pretty social when I have the energy.
Media:vo dialog xhlq003 kokomi 04.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Still, talking to people I don't know is really draining...
Media:vo dialog xhlq003 kokomi 05.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...You saw it, didn't you?
Media:vo xhlq003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? Kokomi isn't here yet...
Media:vo xhlq003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: That's weird. She doesn't seem like the type to show up late to things... Eh, let's wait a while longer.
Media:vo xhlq003 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: How is she still not here? Do you think she could be in trouble?
Media:vo xhlq003 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Let's go ask that soldier over there.
Media:vo xhlq003 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So strange... Guess we should just call it a rain check then?
Media:vo xhlq003 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Kokomi really does think of everything! Alright, let's find the place she wrote about and have a look.
Media:vo xhlq003 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Are you sure this is the right place? It feels like we keep heading deeper into the middle of nowhere...
Media:vo xhlq003 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hey, doesn't that tree look like the one she described in the directive, (Traveler)?
Media:vo xhlq003 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: It looks like there's a way in over there... Let's take a look!
Media:vo xhlq003 2 shibata 01.ogg Shibata: Are you looking for Her Excellency?
Media:vo xhlq003 2 shibata 02.ogg Shibata: I'm afraid she isn't here at the moment. I don't know where she's gone.
Media:vo xhlq003 2 shibata 03.ogg Shibata: Not necessarily. If I recall correctly, Her Excellency has made special provisions for just such a scenario in her General Operational Directives.
Media:vo xhlq003 2 shibata 04.ogg Shibata: Let me see... Ah yes, No. 98. "Should a visitor from afar come to see me, and should my whereabouts be unknown, direct them to proceed southward until they arrive at a tree with purple foliage."
Media:vo xhlq003 2 shibata 05.ogg Shibata: The footnote stipulates that this only applies when Her Excellency has made no communication regarding her whereabouts before disappearing, and even then only when the visitor in question is of VIP status.
Media:vo xhlq003 2 shibata 06.ogg Shibata: As far as I'm concerned, you two tick all of the boxes. I keep this directive on me at all times — I'm sure this is the right course of action.
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh... It's you...
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I—I apologize... I'm not feeling my usual self today.
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: No no, it's nothing like that... It's just, my energy is completely spent.
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 04.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: No, it's just a figure of speech. *sigh* I'm ashamed to admit it, but I can't always be the infinitely capable person I present myself as.
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 05.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh... you noticed? I guess I haven't quite mastered the ability to hide how I'm feeling. I'll keep working at it...
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 06.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: To be honest, I'm not really cut out to be a leader. At first, my dream was to read up on military strategy and perhaps become an adviser.
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 07.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Constantly communicating with people, trying to retain their morale, having to read between the lines, making sure everyone gets the recognition they deserve... It's such hard work.
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 08.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: You're somehow supposed to make people feel wonderful just from being in your presence, while also commanding their respect... It doesn't come naturally to me. Truth be told, it's something I never wanted for myself.
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 09.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: But because of my bloodline, I was always going to end up being the Divine Priestess sooner or later. Like it or not, it's just the way it is.
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 10.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: So whenever I feel overwhelmed, I come here to just lose myself in a book and relax for a while...
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 11.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Don't worry, it doesn't affect my work. I handed over preparations for the Victory Feast to someone else.
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 12.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I have to make a speech tonight, and I mustn't give the troops any reason to suspect that something could be wrong. This peace was hard-won, and I want them to feel at ease.
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 13.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I should be feeling energized again soon if I hold off on work for a little longer. *sigh* If only there were some way I could listen to a good read on military strategy, I'm sure that'd speed up the process...
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 14.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I was reading a book last time I was here, but I only got about halfway through. Where did I put it...
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 15.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: You'd do that for me? Thank you.
Media:vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 16.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hehe... I'm really lucky you came back to Watatsumi Island.
Media:vo xhlq003 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Kokomi!
Media:vo xhlq003 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So this is where you ran off to! We were gonna meet up and get things ready for the Victory Feast today, what happened?
Media:vo xhlq003 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: *gasp* You got sick? We'll go find a doctor right away!
Media:vo xhlq003 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Y—You run on energy? *gasp* You mean... you're like a Ruin Guard?
Media:vo xhlq003 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Is there anything we can do to help?
Media:vo xhlq003 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: We'll find it for you!
Media:vo xhlq003 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: And then we'll read it out to you — to help you recover!
Media:vo xhlq003 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa... Look at all these petitions.
Media:vo xhlq003 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So does Kokomi make time to deal with these even when she's resting?
Media:vo xhlq003 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: "Sangonomiya Events Cash Flow Statement," "Consolidated Annual Report on Fishing Production," "Watatsumi Island Monthly Maintenance Expenses Breakdown"...
Media:vo xhlq003 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: This is a lot of work for one person. And it's on top of all the directives she has to write and the people she has to meet day-to-day. It's no wonder she gets burnt out from time to time.
Media:vo xhlq003 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Let's track down that book and help her feel like herself again!
Media:vo xhlq003 5 kokomi 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah, that's... that's just, um...
Media:vo xhlq003 5 kokomi 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Give. It. Here.
Media:vo xhlq003 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, look, (Traveler). Could this be the book she wanted?

Media:vo xhlq003 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Eh-heh, guess that was the wrong one... Let's keep looking.
Media:vo xhlq003 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's gotta be this one, right, (Traveler)?
Media:vo xhlq003 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Look, there's even a bookmark. None of the other books have one, so she must have finished reading those already.
Media:vo xhlq003 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Whew, it's pretty dense. Paimon doesn't understand a thing...
Media:vo xhlq003 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Well, let's take it over and read it to her!
Media:vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hmm, I'm not sure, actually... Could you read a bit out loud?
Media:vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: *yawns* Yes, that's the one! Thank you.

You read Kokomi her favorite military treatise.
You take a break together with Kokomi for a while more.
