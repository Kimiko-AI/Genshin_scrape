Prelude
Outside in the quiet countryside.
In the verdant wilds of Narukami, Haru and Sasano stand back to back, each speaking with their eyes closed.
Sasano: The wind is coming.
Haru: Where from?
Sasano: Don't worry about where it's coming from, all you need to know is that it's coming for them.
Haru: Where are they?
Sasano: That outlander? They're already walking the path to death.
Sasano opens his eyes, then walks into the distance holding Haru's hand.
 
Act I, Scene II
Outside in the quiet countryside.
The outlander and the two are besieged by the enemy. After escaping with great difficulty, they arrive in the countryside, wounded. (The outlander isn't bleeding)
Sasano: This won't do. If this continues, we won't have a chance against them.
Haru: We'll have to sacrifice ourselves.
The two rush out of the frame.
Outlander: How did this happen?
The outlander wears a pained expression, but soon makes up their mind again.
Outlander: But I won't lose like this. (Close-Up)
Outlander: Don't underestimate my resolve! (Super Close-Up)
The outlander turns and walks back towards the enemy ranks as the screen fades to black. Next scene.
 
Act I, Scene III
Outdoors, the enemy stronghold.
After making up their mind, the outlander cuts their way to the enemy stronghold.
Haru: (Desperately) Don't worry about us!
Sasano: (Impatiently and loudly) Hurry, go on without us!
The outlander spins around, continuously swinging their weapon. Through this endless rotation, this warrior becomes a golden whirlwind! The golden whirlwind covers every inch of the frame.
Each enemy caught in the golden whirlwind's endless attacks suffers pain immeasurably worse than that of tooth decay!
The golden whirlwind rapidly flings all enemies on screen into the distance, where they land hard on the ground!
The outlander finally reaches the imprisoned Sasano and Haru, freeing them.
 *burp*
 About Koharu?
 And who might you be, may I ask?
Furuta: Hehe, back in the day, I would track thieves practically day and night, clean up Villain Nobushi, things like that. It was a cinch.
Furuta: These old bones can't manage that anymore though, so I just spend my days cleaning the house. Still, the years haven't been forgiving to my aching back.
 Bird Egg Sushi, please.
 But I won't lose like this.
 Don't underestimate my resolve!
Xavier: Very nice! Excellent performance, (Traveler).
Xavier: Mr. Sasano, Ms. Koharu, you two need to go over our script. The next scene is between you two. We need to do better than this!
Xavier: (Traveler), we have a lot of battle scenes up next, so you'll need to complete them with the extras.
Xavier: Try to use the flashiest moves you can. I have a lot of faith in your abilities — I know your performance will be stellar.
 Do you sell food here?
Xavier: No, no, no, that's not the line here! Do you still remember it?
Xavier: I think you still need a little more time to memorize your lines.
(Film shoot fails)
 Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen!
Xavier: No, no, no, that's not the line here! Do you still remember it?
Xavier: I think you still need a little more time to memorize your lines.
(Film shoot fails)
 But the script really is kind of awkward.
Xavier: No, no, no, that's not the line here! Do you still remember it?
Xavier: I think you still need a little more time to memorize your lines.
(Film shoot fails)
 Can I help in any way?
 Do you sell food here?
Xavier: No, no, no, that's not the line here! Do you still remember it?
Xavier: I think you still need a little more time to memorize your lines.
(Film shoot fails)
 Don't say that.
 Don't underestimate my resolve!
Xavier: Very nice! Excellent performance, (Traveler).
Xavier: Mr. Sasano, Ms. Koharu, you two need to go over our script. The next scene is between you two. We need to do better than this!
Xavier: (Traveler), we have a lot of battle scenes up next, so you'll need to complete them with the extras.
Xavier: Try to use the flashiest moves you can. I have a lot of faith in your abilities — I know your performance will be stellar.
 Dry-Braised Salted Fish, please.
 Go easy on the drinks.
Xavier: D—Don't say that. It's ru... ruining the vibe! You sound like my mom. *burp* Come on, lesh drink together.
 Maybe some other time.
Xavier: Huh? What kinda friend are you? You're no fun.
 How did this happen?
 But I won't lose like this.
 Don't underestimate my resolve!
Xavier: Very nice! Excellent performance, (Traveler).
Xavier: Mr. Sasano, Ms. Koharu, you two need to go over our script. The next scene is between you two. We need to do better than this!

 Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
Xavier: No, no, no, that's not the line here! Do you still remember it?
Xavier: I think you still need a little more time to memorize your lines.
(Film shoot fails)
 I believe you.
 I come here often, actually.
Furuta: Is that so? I must be getting on in years. My memory just isn't what it used to be.
 I feel the same way.
 I remember.
 I think I know this person.
 I think you've had a little too much drink.
 I would be honored.
 I'd like to help him.
 I'll go talk to the actors.
 I'm not ready yet.
Xavier: No problem at all. We still have time. Let's begin once you're ready.
 I'm ready.
Xavier: Good, good! Then let's begin.
 Isn't Koharu a servant of the Kamisato Clan?
 It was Furuta who was a little worried about you.
 It's fine.
 It's true, I haven't been back for a while now.
Furuta: Haha, I knew it. Now, I may be getting on in years and losing my memory, but at least I didn't forget that.
 Let's drink.
Xavier: Ooh, wait, no — I remember you saying that you wanted to give up drinking. You gotta stay on that wagon, okay?
 When did I say that...?
Xavier: It musta been in my dream.
 Let's go say hello.
 Let's think of a way to remedy this situation.
 Long time no see.
 Maybe some other time.
 One, two, three, four, five?
Xavier: No, no, no, that's not the line here! Do you still remember it?
Xavier: I think you still need a little more time to memorize your lines.
(Film shoot fails)
 Please, go on.
 Quest DescriptionXavier seems to be busy shooting a new film...
 Since we're friends...
 Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
Xavier: No, no, no, that's not the line here! Do you still remember it?
Xavier: I think you still need a little more time to memorize your lines.
(Film shoot fails)
 Sure thing.
 Thanks for your hospitality.
 There, there. It's okay.
 Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen!
Xavier: No, no, no, that's not the line here! Do you still remember it?
Xavier: I think you still need a little more time to memorize your lines.
(Film shoot fails)
 This is a story of friends becoming foes.
Okazaki Rikuto: Very clever, you hit the nail on the head.
 This story about a family's fall following punishment from above... I've heard tales like these before.
Okazaki Rikuto: Looks like our young friend here is well-read!
Okazaki Rikuto: Officials are privileged, but they also have responsibilities, and mistakes must be punished. We have our own rules here in Inazuma.
Okazaki Rikuto: It's not unheard of for an official to slip up and fall into ruin. But you don't seem surprised at all. You must have a wide circle of friends.
Okazaki Rikuto: Since this isn't surprising to you, I'm afraid that the fallout between Seishimaru and the son of the Wakayamas will be equally predictable.
 Training? Knock out?
 Tri-Flavored Skewer, please.
 Uh, I'll kindly decline!
 Was his name Xavier?
 We're very good friends.
 What agreement?
Xavier: Ah, of course, of course — it's already been a long time since then, after all. You must've had many other important matters to take care of, so it's completely understandable that our first meeting didn't leave an impression.
Xavier: Don't worry, I'm not surprised or disappointed. Really.
 What am I supposed to say again?
Xavier: No, no, no, that's not the line here! Do you still remember it?
Xavier: I think you still need a little more time to memorize your lines.
(Film shoot fails)
 What's on your mind?
 When did I say that...?
 Who is Koharu, anyway?
 Worried?
 Xavier?
 You don't have to call me any of that.
 You just need a little more experience.
Act I, Scene II
Act I, Scene III
After making up their mind, the outlander cuts their way to the enemy stronghold.
Each enemy caught in the golden whirlwind's endless attacks suffers pain immeasurably worse than that of tooth decay!
Furuta: Ah me! Not only is my memory like a sieve, but I'm finding myself more and more puzzled by what the younger folk are interested in.
Furuta: Ah, I just hope that the training I've given her will not go to waste.
Furuta: Before, a young'un from Fontaine came here, saying that he was making a "film," and chatted on and on with the master of the house.
Furuta: But after thinking it over, I'm still worried about Koharu.
Furuta: But he wanted to stick with it, so he came to us, the commission in charge of the humanities and arts, for help.
Furuta: Goodness, and he kept saying, um... "Dear." Throwing around a word like that all willy-nilly, does he have no shame?
Furuta: Haha, I knew it. Now, I may be getting on in years and losing my memory, but at least I didn't forget that.
Furuta: Hehe, back in the day, I would track thieves practically day and night, clean up Villain Nobushi, things like that. It was a cinch.
Furuta: I didn't expect the master to agree to this, let alone to send Koharu to help. Is this film really so interesting? This is all completely beyond me.
Furuta: I seem to recall that he took a group of people to an island south of here. Anyway, thanks for letting me talk your ear off for this long.
Furuta: If you could find the time to go see how that film is coming along, I'd be eternally grateful.
Furuta: Is that so? I must be getting on in years. My memory just isn't what it used to be.
Furuta: It sounded like he had received funds from the Tenryou Commission and finally managed to make a film, but the commission wasn't satisfied with the result.
Furuta: Koharu can be quite stubborn. If she really does fail to control herself...
Furuta: Koharu's training hasn't been brief by any means, and while her skills are far from perfect, she could easily knock someone lacking in fighting skills out.
Furuta: Oh, hello. It's been a while since I saw you last.
Furuta: Please come back when you have the time. The entire house would be honored.
Furuta: She's always strictly obeyed the commands of the master and lady and would never deliberately disobey an order, but that child lacks training and composure.
Furuta: Since you know the boy and have earned the trust of the entire house, a humble housekeeper such as myself is naturally at ease when it comes to you.
Furuta: Still, since the master agreed, I should not pass judgment as a mere butler.
Furuta: That outlander is a bit too... unreserved. If he ruffles Koharu's feathers and she can't restrain herself again, there'll be trouble.
Furuta: That's right. I can tell that Koharu isn't too fond of this jabbering outlander.
Furuta: These old bones can't manage that anymore though, so I just spend my days cleaning the house. Still, the years haven't been forgiving to my aching back.
Furuta: Well, who do you think Koharu and I are?
Furuta: Whatever answer you have in mind, all you need to know is that we're absolutely loyal to the Yashiro Commission and the Kamisato Clan.
Furuta: Yes, that's him! He mentioned you as well.
Haru: (Desperately) Don't worry about us!
Haru: We'll have to sacrifice ourselves.
Haru: Where are they?
Haru: Where from?
In the verdant wilds of Narukami, Haru and Sasano stand back to back, each speaking with their eyes closed.
Koharu: (...)
Koharu: Argh! I've had enough of this nonsense!
Koharu: Eh, (Traveler)'s a friend of the Yashiro Commissioner. So you all know each other?
Koharu: Excuse me, but did you come to oversee the filming at my master's request?
Koharu: Huh? An "empty yet fervent passion"? What does that even mean?
Koharu: I was about to say it, alright? Ugh... Don't worry about us.
Koharu: If you made friends with (Traveler), I guess you can't be all bad.
Koharu: She was? I, uh... I guess I've not grown up enough yet if I'm still making her worry.
Koharu: There's no need. We could practice a hundred times and I still wouldn't understand what your script is about.
Koharu: Ugh... Fine, then I will too.
Koharu: Ugh... Just say it. What was the problem this time?
Koharu: We'll have to sacrifice ourselves.
Koharu: You can reprimand or punish me, but I'm not going to keep doing this either.
Koharu: Yup. That's that, then.
Okazaki Rikuto: After that, the younger Wakayama child immediately sought vengeance. Good grief, the cycle never ends, does it?
Okazaki Rikuto: After you leave, we'll tidy up a little, then have Erika go take a rest.
Okazaki Rikuto: Ah, as I was saying... Blinded by hatred, Seishimaru decided to take revenge on the Wakayamas.
Okazaki Rikuto: Ah, you mean Kayabuki Ikkei? An interesting lad, to be sure.
Okazaki Rikuto: Anyway, before any action was taken, Seishimaru, supposedly remembering the old days, took out a Temari and a sword and let the eldest son of the Wakayama family choose between them.
Okazaki Rikuto: Back to the issue — you see, Mr. Xavier? You need a story with an ending that leaves people wanting more.
Okazaki Rikuto: But before Seishimaru could even come knocking at his door, an illness took him.
Okazaki Rikuto: But by then, the person who had personally beheaded Seishimaru's parents had already passed away, leaving the eldest son in charge of the Wakayama estate.
Okazaki Rikuto: But these parents seemingly made a strange error in their work, incurring punishment and eventually submitting to their execution.
Okazaki Rikuto: But to be honest, there is so little thought or hesitation involved here that this person barely seems human at all.
Okazaki Rikuto: For now, suppose that the family responsible was the Wakayama Clan. To all the good people in Inazuma named Wakayama, please don't hate me for this...
Okazaki Rikuto: Good things surely await you and Mr. Xavier.
Okazaki Rikuto: Haha, is that so? I'm glad you liked it.
Okazaki Rikuto: Haha, tell you what, I really envy your youth and drive, Traveler.
Okazaki Rikuto: Having made the wrong choice, the Wakayama's eldest son had no choice but to accept being pursued and slain by Seishimaru. What an ill-fated lad.
Okazaki Rikuto: Hehe, indeed, there is nothing new under the sun. People always lose themselves due to the same old things. I suppose there are plenty of stories like this one in Fontaine too.
Okazaki Rikuto: How was everything?
Okazaki Rikuto: I don't know if that was lucky or unlucky. Dying of an illness and being killed both mean dying either way, so who knows which would have been better?
Okazaki Rikuto: I'm sorry, but that's how the part I heard ends. After all, it's a tale that's been spread to many places, so such vagueness is unavoidable.
Okazaki Rikuto: It's hard not to blame Seishimaru for his death. If it weren't for the former's being bent on revenge, the latter wouldn't have needed to lay low until he fell ill.
Okazaki Rikuto: It's not unheard of for an official to slip up and fall into ruin. But you don't seem surprised at all. You must have a wide circle of friends.
Okazaki Rikuto: Long, long ago, there lived someone named Seishimaru.
Okazaki Rikuto: Looks like our young friend here is well-read!
Okazaki Rikuto: Now, I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but this film you mentioned sounds very interesting indeed. Could you tell me more about it, if you wouldn't mind?
Okazaki Rikuto: Now, how should I know what Seishimaru was thinking? Still, I think that the Temari and sword represented life and death respectively.
Okazaki Rikuto: Officials are privileged, but they also have responsibilities, and mistakes must be punished. We have our own rules here in Inazuma.
Okazaki Rikuto: Ooh, so this outlander has the resolve to stand up and fight when things get tough. Impressive.
Okazaki Rikuto: Seishimaru was born to samurai parents who worked for powerful people. Well, they weren't very powerful themselves, but they weren't too bad, either.
Okazaki Rikuto: Seishimaru was forced into hiding in the mountains before eventually disappearing.
Okazaki Rikuto: Since this isn't surprising to you, I'm afraid that the fallout between Seishimaru and the son of the Wakayamas will be equally predictable.
Okazaki Rikuto: Since this whole dispute has lost its source, just take "and all was well again" to be this story's ending.
Okazaki Rikuto: Some say Seishimaru fled in fear of the Wakayamas, while others say he let himself sink to the depths of the ocean to quench his burning hatred.
Okazaki Rikuto: This family was also acquainted with Seishimaru's... Goodness me, this story's pretty hard to tell without naming names.
Okazaki Rikuto: This person happened to also be Seishimaru's childhood friend. But now, they had become enemies.
Okazaki Rikuto: To be able to befriend such a person is a gift from the gods. You must be a special person as well to have been so blessed.
Okazaki Rikuto: To this day, such fretful matters as hate and shame should all have flowed into the ley lines with Seishimaru's death.
Okazaki Rikuto: Truth be told, the responsible party did everything by the book, and the family serving as executioner normally shouldn't have been blamed for the sentence they were ordered to carry out.
Okazaki Rikuto: Unable to accept their deaths, Seishimaru toiled to find the samurai family that carried out the sentence.
Okazaki Rikuto: Understood. Erika, one of everything for this table.
Okazaki Rikuto: Very clever, you hit the nail on the head.
Okazaki Rikuto: We're honored that you appreciate Erika's work so much. It's only right that we extend our opening hours for you.
Okazaki Rikuto: When they meet an enemy they can't beat, they summon up the courage to charge anyway... and they actually triumph. That sort of daring is actually rather frightening.
Okazaki Rikuto: Whichever ending you wish to believe, no one ever saw Seishimaru again.
Okazaki Rikuto: Xavier, I'm moved by your dedication to film. I can't help but be reminded of a story I once heard...
Okazaki Rikuto: You're still young, Mr. Xavier. I take it that you've never experienced such life-threatening situations before?
Outdoors, the enemy stronghold.
Outlander: But I won't lose like this. (Close-Up)
Outlander: Don't underestimate my resolve! (Super Close-Up)
Outlander: How did this happen?
Outside in the quiet countryside.
Paimon: Aw, you're a good guy, Xavier! You're Paimon's best friend! Well... one of them, anyway!
Paimon: Err, that doesn't look good. Seems like Koharu's seconds away from flying off the handle.
Paimon: Everything looks so official! Paimon's looking forward to watching your performance, (Traveler). Hee-hee~
Paimon: Getting (him/her) to be the main character is definitely a win for you, Xavier.
Paimon: He must be taking the argument they had earlier really hard. Do you think we should go cheer him up a bit?
Paimon: He says he's gonna write a brand-new script in one day. That's a scary big job, isn't it?
Paimon: Hey, a minute ago you were drunk as a skunk! You're not taking advantage of the situation to get chummy with us, are you?
Paimon: Hm... Paimon remembers him mentioning Uyuu Restaurant. If you think we should go, then let's go look for him.
Paimon: Hmm, maybe you should let Xavier work out the script by himself. Paimon thinks we can help him with his actor problem instead.
Paimon: It's great that he's so motivated, but it's like Mr. Okazaki said... Is it really okay for him to do it all by himself?
Paimon: Mm-hm... Om nom nom nom~ You guys go on, Paimon's just gonna finish up over here first...
Paimon: Now Xavier's gone too. Seems like he's in pretty bad shape.
Paimon: Oh? "Ms. Paimon"... That has a nice ring to it! Alright then, the magnanimous Paimon has decided to forgive you.
Paimon: Paimon can attest to (Traveler)'s ability to improvise! We've traveled together long enough, after all!
Paimon: Paimon knows, Paimon knows! Something awful's gonna happen next. It doesn't matter if it's Mondstadt, Liyue, or Inazuma, it's always the same wherever you go.
Paimon: Um... So, Xavier, are you guys filming?
Paimon: With Sasano and Koharu gone, we shan't have enough actors to continue filming! This is bad...
Paimon: Yeah, that should take a load off his back.
Paimon: Yeah, yeah! All was *not* well at all! What kind of ending is that?
Paimon: Yeesh, it reeks of booze around here. You're drunk, aren't you, Xavier?
Prelude
Sasano opens his eyes, then walks into the distance holding Haru's hand.
Sasano: (Impatiently and loudly) Hurry, go on without us!
Sasano: (These lines are just so awkward, though.)
Sasano: ...
Sasano: And the lines at the end are so awkward I feel embarrassed just reading them.
Sasano: But he wouldn't accept that, so he started publishing his own novels, but not a single one sold in the end.
Sasano: Don't tell me that we've been put through the wringer 11 times for something that guy wrote?
Sasano: Don't worry about where it's coming from, all you need to know is that it's coming for them.
Sasano: Go on home and have your meal.
Sasano: Hold on, I only know one Kayabuki Ikkei, and everything he submitted to the Yae Publishing House always got rejected.
Sasano: I share the sentiment. Why would these two characters suddenly sacrifice themselves and run off to where the enemy is?
Sasano: I'm really sorry that you're so disappointed, but I don't plan to continue taking part in this.
Sasano: In short, I quit. Goodbye.
Sasano: It's not like I want to make things difficult for Mr. Xavier... *sigh* Anyway, I hope you won't have to do it 11 times over like we had to.
Sasano: No matter how you look at it, it just doesn't make any sense. They are just dragging the main character down.
Sasano: That outlander? They're already walking the path to death.
Sasano: The wind is coming.
Sasano: This is the 11th time. I just don't get it.
Sasano: This won't do. If this continues, we won't have a chance against them.
Sasano: This won't do. If this continues, we won't have a chance against... them.
Sasano: Wait a minute, didn't the casting call say that the script was written by a famous writer?
Sasano: Well, it seems like Xavier's got some chops after all...
Sasano: Well, it took this much effort to find the right person for the lead role... I might as well give this one more try.
Sasano: You sure are straightforward.
Soon after, shop owner Okazaki Rikuto piles your table high with food.
The golden whirlwind rapidly flings all enemies on screen into the distance, where they land hard on the ground!
The outlander and the two are besieged by the enemy. After escaping with great difficulty, they arrive in the countryside, wounded. (The outlander isn't bleeding)
The outlander finally reaches the imprisoned Sasano and Haru, freeing them.
The outlander spins around, continuously swinging their weapon. Through this endless rotation, this warrior becomes a golden whirlwind! The golden whirlwind covers every inch of the frame.
The outlander turns and walks back towards the enemy ranks as the screen fades to black. Next scene.
The outlander wears a pained expression, but soon makes up their mind again.
The two rush out of the frame.
Xavier trots off...
Xavier: (Traveler), we have a lot of battle scenes up next, so you'll need to complete them with the extras.
Xavier: *burp*
Xavier: *sigh*... But it's going to be tricky with those two actors. Ms. Koharu and Mr. Sasano don't seem keen on trying again.
Xavier: ...Mr. Okazaki, I must say that you are indeed a gentleman of great insight.
Xavier: ...Mr. Sasano, Ms. Koharu, I'm disappointed in both of you.
Xavier: Absolutely! I have no doubt of that. Well then, (Mr./Miss) (Traveler), here are the scripts for the next two scenes.
Xavier: Actually, I don't blame Ms. Koharu. *burp* Or Mr. Sasano. They were very cooperative at first.
Xavier: Ah! Sitting in a restaurant, eating, and listening to stories like this is also so... so Inazuma! I love it.
Xavier: Ah, I am so sorry. Your efforts... I fear they shall go to waste now.
Xavier: Ah, of course, of course — it's already been a long time since then, after all. You must've had many other important matters to take care of, so it's completely understandable that our first meeting didn't leave an impression.
Xavier: Alright, (Traveler), to the next spot now. Hurry, hurry!
Xavier: As you can see, following "The Seventh Samurai," I finally came up with a way to secure the necessary resources to shoot another film.
Xavier: Being stingy with my friends would damage my character, and I am, if nothing else, a person of character!
Xavier: Besides, I find this no-nonsense, swords-drawn approach very Inazuma-esque.
Xavier: But I can't blame them either. I'll just have to think of something when the time comes.
Xavier: But I refuse to accept this. I refuse!
Xavier: But I think I can be more than an engineer. I've read lots of books, and I can write stuff.
Xavier: But I think I can now write an all-new, presentable script now and give this one more shot. It'll definitely work this time. No, I'll make it work.
Xavier: But it's all worth it for the sake of artistic perfection. As such, I hope that...
Xavier: Certainly not "life-threatening," no. But is this the reason why my script has been criticized? Hmm...
Xavier: Come, let's eat. For our dreams!
Xavier: Dear (Traveler), dear Paimon, now this is what I call a real meal!
Xavier: Don't get the wrong idea, (Traveler), I just think you're truly my most dearest and bestest friend.
Xavier: Don't worry, I'm not surprised or disappointed. Really.
Xavier: D—Don't say that. It's ru... ruining the vibe! You sound like my mom. *burp* Come on, lesh drink together.
Xavier: Eh? How could you...
Xavier: Especially one of the legend's endings, the one where Seishimaru disappears to put an end to his hatred. That sounds just like what a friend of mine from Sumeru would do.
Xavier: From what I understand, quite a number of great authors are homebodies.
Xavier: Good, good! Then let's begin.
Xavier: Great! I would kiss you if I could, but I drank a smidge too much... and my breath stinks.
Xavier: Heavens above, I just don't even know how to describe it.
Xavier: Heavens forgive me, I'm a real souse this morning, I am. I left my friend in the restaurant after completely forgetting about them!
Xavier: Heh, you found me. *burp*
Xavier: Huh? What kinda friend are you? You're no fun.
Xavier: I could... I could also be a film writer, an actor, a director!
Xavier: I mean, I know that there have been some issues with these performances, but it's nothing a few more rehearsals can't fix!
Xavier: I need you to be more patient. Use your voice to express this rich emotion.
Xavier: I think I know what was missing from my film before.
Xavier: I think you still need a little more time to memorize your lines.
Xavier: I want to thank you for your kindness and the nudge you've given me, and not just through this story — your unique way of giving advice has given me just the inspiration I needed.
Xavier: I wouldn't be surprised if the legend of Seishimaru took place in Fontaine.
Xavier: I'm just... I confess, I'm at a loss for words. I'm going to Uyuu Restaurant for a moment. I need to be alone. I'm sorry.
Xavier: I'm not talking outta my hat here, I could rea... really do it. Don't you believe me?
Xavier: I...
Xavier: If I can manage to write an even better script, I'll come back to offer you my most solemn gratitude.
(Xavier leaves)
Xavier: If you don't mind, could I ask if you maybe, possibly, at all remember our agreement from before?
Xavier: It musta been in my dream.
Xavier: Make ready, everyone... and action!
Xavier: Mr. Kayabuki's original work was also in this style, and in order to preserve these unique elements, I've decided to honor the source.
Xavier: Mr. Sasano, Ms. Koharu, you two need to go over our script. The next scene is between you two. We need to do better than this!
Xavier: Mr. Sasano?
Xavier: Ms. Koharu, Mr. Sasano, I am very sorry for making you both go over this so many times.
Xavier: Ms. Paimon, if my behavior was at all untoward just now, can you forgive me? I didn't mean you any offense.
Xavier: My best friend, I must treat you to a meal today, and I won't take no for an answer.
Xavier: My dear (Traveler), you are indeed a great listener.
Xavier: My dear fellow, we order food from you, correct? Come, my friend, order whatever you'd like.
Xavier: My dear sir, we'll have the Tri-Flavored Skewer, Tonkotsu Ramen, and whatever else you serve here.
Xavier: My dearest, most adored good friend, you're closer to me than a sibling, so I'll tell you something about me: I'm an engineer.
Xavier: No problem at all. We still have time. Let's begin once you're ready.
Xavier: No, no, no, I couldn't ask for anything more comforting than having you here to listen to me vent.
Xavier: No, no, no, that's not the line here! Do you still remember it?
Xavier: No, no, no, your line is "Hurry, go on without us!"
Xavier: Of course, of course! And here you are right at this most dire moment, like an oasis in the deserts of Sumeru — precious and timely.
Xavier: Oh, (Traveler) and Paimon, my dear friends! How marvelous it is to see familiar faces at a time like this.
Xavier: Ooh, wait, no — I remember you saying that you wanted to give up drinking. You gotta stay on that wagon, okay?
Xavier: Please allow me a little more time. Just one day will suffice.
Xavier: Simply divine! I could taste the lake in your rice and fish. That sweet and delicate aroma is just like what I'd have in my hometown of Petrichor.
Xavier: Since I've come to Inazuma, I should make some films with that Inazuma flair.
Xavier: Smoother, Mr. Sasano, smoother!
Xavier: So, what do you say? Will you be my... (male/female) lead?
Xavier: Thank you, Mr. Okazaki. This is for the meal.
Xavier: That is to say, or I think that is to say, it's probably 'cause I'm, um, not that talented.
Xavier: That's absolutely right! This story was adapted from a novel written by the renowned author Kayabuki Ikkei. And who adapted it, you might ask? None other than myself.
Xavier: That's all? No, no, no, unacceptable. You are my best friend! The best friend of Xavier, man of Fontaine!
Xavier: That's right, (Traveler) was the first friend I made in Inazuma. The Fatui who dumped a bunch of work on me and those non-communicative samurai don't count.
Xavier: That's... it? So, not even you know where this Seishimaru went?
Xavier: The difference between these crude shots and a true film is like... like Mondstadt's Dandelion Wine and Apple Cider — one is alcohol, one isn't. They simply aren't the same thing.
Xavier: The lead role hasn't been decided yet, but thanks to Lord Kamisato's generosity, the funds, props, and nearly all the other early-stage problems have already been taken care of.
Xavier: The problem this time, Ms. Koharu, is that your performance just now was completely passionless.
Xavier: The story is quite complete, but it's lacking some emotional turmoil. Hmm...
Xavier: They didn't come right out and say it, but they were totally silent, which means they didn't approve.
Xavier: This is a crime, a crime against art. This can't go on, my friends.
Xavier: This time, I was able to get funding from Lord Kamisato to make this film, so I... I must take this seriously! Don't you think?
Xavier: Try to use the flashiest moves you can. I have a lot of faith in your abilities — I know your performance will be stellar.
Xavier: Very nice! Excellent performance, (Traveler).
Xavier: Wasn't it just, um, right, when we were filming. I was... being questioned. Madly so! Yesh!
Xavier: We'll talk about this matter the next time we meet.
Xavier: Well, if you're ready, we can go ahead and begin a test shot.
Xavier: Well, let me put it this way. Is having an identical experience first strictly necessary to writing a good story?
Xavier: Well, so long as, as per our previous agreement, you remain willing to play the role of the (male/female) lead in my new film.
Xavier: What does that mean?
Xavier: When I wrote those lines, my heart was bursting with an... an empty yet fervent passion, yes, empty yet fervent.
Xavier: With feeling, Ms. Koharu! Once more with feeling!
Xavier: Wonderful! I feel much better now. Let's meet tomorrow at Komore Teahouse. I'll bring an even better script, you'll see!
Xavier: You aren't just my "dear friend," you're my esteemed, reliable, true friend.
Xavier: You can't remember your lines, your readings are all over the place, and you're not giving me any emotion! How am I supposed to work with that?
Xavier: You know that film I worked so hard on before? Well, the higher-ups at the Tenryou Commission didn't like it too much.
Xavier: You really think so? Even though I've never said so, I for my part have considered you a true friend right from the start.
Xavier: You! You really are a good person, ya know that? You're so, so good. Here, lemme give you a hug!
Xavier: Your lines, Ms. Koharu! How have you forgotten your line?
Xavier: Your scenes are Act I, Scene II and III. I've highlighted your lines, so please take note of them.
You and Xavier explain the film to Okazaki Rikuto and show him the script as well.
You have a meal with Xavier.
