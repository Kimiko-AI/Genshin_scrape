 ...To think that someone might use something like that as a cover.
 It's inexcusable...
Sango: Calm down. To a criminal, society is just a toy to be used to get what they desire.

 The Vision Hunt Decree has been abolished, though.
Sango: Well, yes... And I imagine that this fellow isn't sure what their next move should be, either.

Ishikawa Hachirou: Have you seen my... Vision...
 "You had a Vision?"
Ishikawa Hachirou: I did... I did... it was right here... Where did it go
Ishikawa Hachirou: Where did it go... Wah...
Ishikawa Hachirou: ...Sorry, brother... I lost my vision too... Wah

 About the theft at Shimura's...
 Are you Shimura Kanbei?
 Have you seen anyone around who seems suspicious?
 How was the thief so precise in their timing?
 How's the case been going?
 Is there really anyone like that?
 It's inexcusable...
 Quest DescriptionSango from the Bantan Sango Detective Agency seems to have new thoughts about the case she has on hand...
 So this is a dead end!
 So, about the theft...
 The Vision Hunt Decree has been abolished, though.
 The thief sure seems familiar with their routines...
Sango: That's right. But as you can see, there aren't many merchants or residents on this street. If a local committed the crime, someone would figure it out.
Sango: But if it wasn't a local, how could the culprit be so precise about when the victims would leave their stores?
 This makes no sense.
Furuya Noboru: But if you need proof that I was on Guild premises at the time, you can ask Katheryne.
Furuya Noboru: Hmm? May I help you with something?
Furuya Noboru: I was busy working at the Adventurers' Guild at the time when the theft occurred.
Furuya Noboru: If you need proof that I was on Guild premises at the time, you can ask Katheryne.
Furuya Noboru: If you take the Vision Hunt Decree into account... there's just far too many people whose actions might be interpreted as "suspicious."
Furuya Noboru: If you're looking for a witness, I'm sorry, I don't have any information of value.
Furuya Noboru: Suspicious?
Furuya Noboru: That? I heard about it.
Furuya Noboru: To be honest, it's a bit hard for me to tell.
Ishikawa Hachirou: ...Sorry, brother... I lost my vision too... Wah
Ishikawa Hachirou: H-How did it all end so quickly...
Ishikawa Hachirou: Have you seen my... Vision...
Ishikawa Hachirou: I did... I did... it was right here... Where did it go
Ishikawa Hachirou: No, I have to find some other way...
Ishikawa Hachirou: The Vision Hunt Decree is over... I... This...
Ishikawa Hachirou: Where did it go... Wah...
Ryuuji: It is a bold move indeed on the culprit's part to steal Mora from Mr. Kanbei...
Ryuuji: She has not found the culprit yet.
Sango: A few years ago, he might have simply grabbed his sword and gone out to nab the culprit himself.
Sango: After discovering that the Mora had been stolen from the store, Mr. Kanbei was beside himself with rageâ€”spent some time just yelling angrily outside, so I hear.
Sango: After that, go ask around a bit. Let's see if anyone saw or heard anything while the theft was ongoing at Shimura's.
Sango: Ah, right. Miss Yayoi's lacquerware store was also hit. When she went out on a delivery run, a lot of pricey lacquerware was stolen from the store.
Sango: And that persona must have been that of someone who could reasonably show up anywhere at any time without drawing any suspicion.
Sango: As I said, there aren't many residents here and they all know each other. If there were any strangers amongst them, everyone would have noticed.
Sango: As such, I'd like to ask you and Ryuuji to go check out how he's doing and listen to, well, his complaints.
Sango: But if it wasn't a local, how could the culprit be so precise about when the victims would leave their stores?
Sango: But the methods used are rather precise, and the culprit covered their tracks very well. It doesn't look at all like the Treasure Hoarders' usual handiwork.
Sango: Calm down. To a criminal, society is just a toy to be used to get what they desire.
Sango: Come back and tell me when you're done. I'll be here waiting for you.
Sango: Faced with someone who has lost their Vision, even a stranger from another nation would normally feel sympathetic rather than suspicious, right?
Sango: He noticed that Mr. Kanbei would close his store every few days so he could have a drink.
Sango: Here's your remuneration, by the way.
Sango: Hmm... I need to find a few more clues...
Sango: I also considered that. After Amano and Andou checked the whereabouts of the surrounding households and businesses, the possibility of a local committing the crime has been ruled out.
Sango: I believe that... perhaps the thief personally scouted out and collected information about the lives of people around the city to make their plans...
Sango: Kanbei has been coming over for several days to ask me to find the culprit. Honestly, I'm getting sick of that loud voice of his.
Sango: Of course. In fact, you may have met quite a few such people already.
Sango: Oh-ho, Traveler. You're just in time. We've hit a critical point in our case.
Sango: Once I get enough evidence, I'll need your skills again. Until then, go get some rest.
Sango: Our culprit also somehow knew that Genichirou is in the habit of visiting a friend every so often, and committed the theft of quite a few valuable items while he was away.
Sango: People who have experienced a drastic change in personality due to the loss of their Vision.
Sango: Perhaps, to be more convincing and gain sympathy, they might mumble some nonsense to themselves...
Sango: So after Mr. Kanbei got drunk, they took the Mora in the store and strolled out leisurely.
Sango: So the culprit is still committing crimes in the city from time to time, leaving a lot of tracks behind.
Sango: So, if the thief could do this, then... he has to have a "suitable persona."
Sango: So, if this stranger was also telling stories about their past... maybe people would be moved to give them Mora. That's how they got the capital to start up this criminal operation.
Sango: Someone who has gone through a drastic personality change due to the loss of their Vision. Someone who is drowsy all day, who doesn't know where they were from, and who won't talk to anyone.
Sango: Thank you for your help. It should only take us a few more steps to find our culprit.
Sango: Thanks to Amano and Andou's actions, our culprit seems convinced that the Doushin's investigation is directed towards the Treasure Hoarders.
Sango: That seems to be the only possibility...
Sango: That's right. But as you can see, there aren't many merchants or residents on this street. If a local committed the crime, someone would figure it out.
Sango: The culprit committed another crime yesterday. This time, the victim was Mr. Kanbei, the owner of Shimura's.
Sango: The locations of crime were scattered. It seems like they were done on a whim by Treasure Hoarders roaming into the city...
Sango: The timing was quite clever too.
Sango: They are...
Sango: They might even drink alcohol while staring blankly at the roadside, blabbering about nothing other than their lost Vision when spoken to.
Sango: This culprit really knows how to pick his targets. Aside from Mr. Kanbei, the owner of Netsuke no Gen Crafts, Mikoshi Genichirou, was also a victim.
Sango: This thief does have some interesting ideas...
Sango: Well, yes... And I imagine that this fellow isn't sure what their next move should be, either.
Sango: Well... I see... Thank you. You did a great job.
Sango: You're back. How was it? Did you find anything out?
Shimura Kanbei: Ah, yes, I am, and you are... Oh! If it isn't Ryuuji!
Shimura Kanbei: Curses... who would do such a thing...
Shimura Kanbei: Darn it... Who on earth would have done this...
Shimura Kanbei: Has Ms. Sango found out who that rascal is? Why, I'm going to whoop...
Shimura Kanbei: I've told Ms. Sango everything that I know. I drank too much and fell asleep straight away.
Shimura Kanbei: When I woke up, all the Mora in the store was gone!
Yayoi Nanatsuki: Hello... How may I help you?
Yayoi Nanatsuki: Not to mention how the atmosphere in the city is really tense right now. If there was anyone suspicious, they would probably have been taken away by the Doushin for questioning by now...
Yayoi Nanatsuki: Sorry, I didn't see anything... In fact, I didn't know about it until I was woken up by the sound of Mr. Kanbei's roaring...
Yayoi Nanatsuki: Suspicious people? Well...I didn't see anyone suspicious.
Yayoi Nanatsuki: Wait. Are you asking if I saw anything?
Yayoi Nanatsuki: Well, I sure did hear about it. It was hard not to hear Mr. Kanbei's angry voice...
