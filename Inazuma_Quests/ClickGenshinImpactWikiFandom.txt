 Quest DescriptionSusan from Mondstadt seems to be looking for some help...
 Very lovely indeed, ma'am.
 What are you doing?
Susan: But I don't have anyone who can take pictures for me. Which is a crying shame: I'd asked a friend of mine to help purchase this Kamera in Fontaine and all, too.
Susan: But since you're here Traveler, may I ask you to help me take some pictures?
Susan: But we had no idea that the situation in Inazuma would become like this. Since we can't go home anyway, I suggested that we travel around Inazuma.
Susan: Come! This is your reward for pictures of me. Here you go!
Susan: Have you finished taking the pictures? Let me have a look at them.
Susan: My name is Susan, and I'm from Mondstadt. My husband is here in Inazuma on a business trip, so I came here with him.
Susan: Not bad! I'm a natural-born beauty after all, hahaha...
Susan: Oh, Traveler, you're such a sweet talker!
Susan: Oh, are you the Traveler? Great! I was just looking for someone to help me out.
Susan: Okay, I'm ready now!
Susan: Please tell me if my pose is alright or not. Should I tilt my head a bit?
Susan: Thank you, Traveler.
Susan: The scenery here is rather lovely. If only someone was around to take a picture for me...
Susan: Unfortunately, my husband is really lazy, and I couldn't get him out the door. I ended up traveling by myself...
