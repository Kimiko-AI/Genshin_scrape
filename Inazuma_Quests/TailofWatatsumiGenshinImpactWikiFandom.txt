 How are they gonna measure our respect, though?
 Quest DescriptionYou must first break the five seals on Watatsumi Island if you wish to enter Enkanomiya.
 Step DescriptionAn ancient stone tablet stands beside the shrine. Will there be anything of use written on it?
 Step DescriptionFatui, Fatui everywhere... Do you really have to teach this lesson every time...
 Step DescriptionWith the help of the stone tablet's instructions, perhaps breaking the shrine seal will not be a problem... Right?
 Step DescriptionYou have finally broken the shrine's seal, and the Spirit Pearl is yours to claim. Go forth and take it!
Ancient Stone Tablet: "This holy hall contains a divine blessing. Tread lightly and walk slowly, following the lights. Run not, rush never, make no hue or cry, and approach with piety in one heart for our great Omikami's grace."
Fatui: Look like we've found the most pious people on Watatsumi Island, mwahaha!
Paimon: And that's a third! We're getting close!
Paimon: Fourth Spirit Pearl obtained! Let's go find Tsuyuko!
Paimon: Oh no... Looks like we can't take too long.
Paimon: There's another Spirit Pearl!
Paimon: This must be Goshou Rock's "Tail"!
Paimon: Ugh, quit following us everywhere!
Paimon: Uh, so this means we need to take it easy... and respectfully?
Paimon: We found a pearl. Is this the Spirit Pearl Tsuyuko talked about?
