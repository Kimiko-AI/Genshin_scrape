Ogura Mio: Ah, so that's what you've brought. Yes, yes, I do think that these colors will be quite the novelty indeed.
Ogura Mio: Thanks so much for getting me these, Traveler. I'll give them a try in a moment — please take this as compensation for your efforts.
Ogura Mio: I wonder what colors we'll be able to get...

Ogura Mio: But at the moment, we have yet to reestablish connections with our suppliers, so we can only work with the stock we still have.
Ogura Mio: As such, every bolt of silk we use here is one we're not getting back...

Ogura Mio: But with the current situation here, we haven't been able to import that sort of silk in a while now. We've been having to rely on our existing stock to continue operations.
Ogura Mio: Every bolt of silk we use here is one we're not getting back...

Ogura Mio: Th—these... Are you sure that these can be used in dyes? I can't say I've ever heard of them...
Ogura Mio: O—Oh well, I suppose I'll just give it a go. Here, Traveler, take these as a token of my appreciation...
 Do you only need dyes?
Ogura Mio: In these circumstances, I think that's the only thing I can do at the moment...
Ogura Mio: If you know of any such base material that can be used to make "new" dyes, please bring them to me. I'll arrange for the necessary payment.
 I did.
 I wouldn't say so, exactly...
 Is something the matter?
 Leave it to me.
 Oh, I've seen some alright.
Ogura Mio: I—Is that so?
Ogura Mio: If you could, please help me broaden my horizons. Find me some base materials from which I can might make new types of dye.
Ogura Mio: I will take care of the payment. Again, thank you so much!
 Quest DescriptionOgura Mio, the owner of Ogura Textiles & Kimonos, is rather anxious about something...
 So, do you have any ideas for kimono patterns?
 You used to import material from Liyue?
Ogura Mio: Ah, I see. Um, this might be rather presumptuous of me, but... could you help me ask other outlanders about patterns that we could use?
Ogura Mio: Ah, I'm sorry. I was just  a little lost in my own thoughts. Are you here to buy some clothes?
Ogura Mio: Ah, so that's what you've brought. Yes, yes, I do think that these colors will be quite the novelty indeed.
Ogura Mio: As such, every bolt of silk we use here is one we're not getting back...
Ogura Mio: Books and... tea sets? That sounds interesting.
Ogura Mio: But I can't think of anything that might be considered a "novel" pattern...
Ogura Mio: But I've been unable to come up with anything that might be considered "new" dyes...
Ogura Mio: But at the moment, we have yet to reestablish connections with our suppliers, so we can only work with the stock we still have.
Ogura Mio: But how should we make them exactly? Hmm, I need to give this a bit more thought...
Ogura Mio: But with the current situation here, we haven't been able to import that sort of silk in a while now. We've been having to rely on our existing stock to continue operations.
Ogura Mio: Considering your many journeys, Traveler, I'm sure you've seen a great deal. Have you encountered any dye-work that you might consider "novel"?
Ogura Mio: Every bolt of silk we use here is one we're not getting back...
Ogura Mio: Great! So what did they say?
Ogura Mio: Great, let me think... You should go ask Miss Tang Wen and Mr. Ramsay. Perhaps they will have some new ideas.
Ogura Mio: Have you found any suitable base materials?
Ogura Mio: I originally planned to design some novel kimono patterns myself, or use some new dyes to make new cloth and attract customers.
Ogura Mio: I will take care of the payment. Again, thank you so much!
Ogura Mio: I wonder what colors we'll be able to get...
Ogura Mio: I'm the only one running Ogura Textiles & Kimonos at the moment, so I can't leave the store. If I want to gather information, I can only ask others to do it for me.
Ogura Mio: If you could, please help me broaden my horizons. Find me some base materials from which I can might make new types of dye.
Ogura Mio: If you know of any such base material that can be used to make "new" dyes, please bring them to me. I'll arrange for the necessary payment.
Ogura Mio: In these circumstances, I think that's the only thing I can do at the moment...
Ogura Mio: I—Is that so?
Ogura Mio: O—Oh well, I suppose I'll just give it a go. Here, Traveler, take these as a token of my appreciation...
Ogura Mio: Perhaps Miss Tang Wen and Mr. Ramsay will have some new ideas...
Ogura Mio: So did you ask them about it?
Ogura Mio: Thank you, Traveler. This information has proved extremely useful to me. Please, accept these as a token of my appreciation.
Ogura Mio: Thanks so much for getting me these, Traveler. I'll give them a try in a moment — please take this as compensation for your efforts.
Ogura Mio: The high-class silks from Liyue remain out of stock, but we still have the latest kimonos.
Ogura Mio: This is no way to continue doing business...
Ogura Mio: Th—these... Are you sure that these can be used in dyes? I can't say I've ever heard of them...
Ogura Mio: Traveler, you've seen a lot, I'm sure. Have you encountered any designs that you might consider "novel"?
Ogura Mio: Yes. Before, we were often able to secure high-end silk from Liyue such as those that the Feiyun Commerce Guild makes from Silk Flowers.
Ramsay: A kimono printed with a tea set design... Hahaha, now that certainly would have an Inazuman feel.
Ramsay: But if I were to choose a design, I'd go with tea sets. Those would look neat on a kimono.
Ramsay: Hello, are you an outlander who came to Inazuma too? Ah, we've become a real rare sight recently.
Ramsay: Kimono patterns? Haha, I'm not exactly an expert on that.
Tang Wen: ...
Tang Wen: Ah, hello. I was thinking about something, and I didn't notice you. Sorry.
Tang Wen: But if you were to ask me... I think that books might look great as a design on a kimono.
Tang Wen: Hmm, books printed on kimonos... Now wouldn't that be interesting...
Tang Wen: Kimono patterns? I'm afraid I don't know anything about that...
