 But Kano Nana hasn't returned yet.
 But is growing taller really related to how long you sleep?
 Did you find out more about the ambush thing?
 Fine, if that's what we have to do.
 Good to hear.
 Growing taller is what you really care about, isn't it?

 Growing?
 How is your appetite these days?
 I can see that you're tired, but it's not good to neglect your work either.

 I don't think I should be doing this kind of thing.
 I don't think anyone could "suddenly" grow taller.
 I've been meaning to ask you... Why are you so obsessed with sleeping all the time?
 I've never seen anyone grow in their sleep.
 It seems you aren't taking the matter to heart at all.
 It's not the amount of sleep but the quality of sleep that's keeping you from growing.

 It's still your responsibility to fulfil your duties.
 Now you're the one trying to convince me to work.
 Plants grow best when the environmental conditions are right for them to generate energy and get proper nutrition. The same is probably true for people.
 Quest DescriptionSayu has been discovered by Kano Nana, and has no choice but to return to Chinju Forest to practice ninjutsu. She begs you to come along, and so you do...
 Sleep alone isn't enough to make you grow taller.
 Sleep alone isn't enough to make you grow taller.
(Proceed to Branch 1.A)
 So that's why you wanted me to come along? To help you slack off?
 You don't need to grow as big as a samurai though...
 You should try to at least keep your sensei and Kano Nana from worrying.
 You still haven't taken anything I've said to heart.
After a while, Kano Nana returns.
Kano Nana leaves.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: We've arrived. Alright, I will go to the Yashiro Commission now to inquire about Sayu's mission orders. In the meantime, please keep an eye on her.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 02a.ogg Kano Nana: Sayu, you can start by warming up. Though you may often be difficult for me, I certainly will not abide any trouble for the Traveler. Understand?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 03.ogg Kano Nana: Oh, I'm honestly surprised to see you still here, Sayu. Unless... Is this some sort of trick?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 04.ogg Kano Nana: Is that so? Though it is strictly forbidden for some techniques to be taught to outsiders...
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 05.ogg Kano Nana: But I suppose you are an exception in this case.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 06.ogg Kano Nana: Indeed, I did. I was able to determine that the Yashiro Commission had no intent of carrying out such a mission. They are now investigating the origins of these orders.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 07.ogg Kano Nana: Rest assured, the related personnel are all aware of the situation and there should be no further threats to your safety.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 08.ogg Kano Nana: Well then, let us begin your ninjutsu training.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 kanonana 09.ogg Kano Nana: Please, (Traveler), follow us.

Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Yes, ma'am.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Good, she's gone. Phew, no more work for today, hehe!
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Actually... I invited you to come as a helper. No need to go into too much detail.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: The shrine maiden is terrifying. As soon as she picks up on my tracks, it's nearly impossible for me to shake her.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: But you are also super skilled, so maybe you can help me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Huh? You mean you won't rescue someone in a moment of dire need?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: All that goes on here is cruel and involuntary labor.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: Is it wrong to wish for ample rest? How else can I ever reach my growth spurt!? I'm not being unreasonable.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: Don't you know, there are tons of benefits to sleeping! You can regain energy, clear your mind, pass the time, and escape from all your troubles.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: But most importantly, sleep helps you grow, and I've got plenty of growing to do.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: That's right. The other ninja can leap up tall trees in a single bound and pick the tasty fruit way up high. Being tall is the key to everything.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: All the other ninja my age are already way taller than me. Sensei told me that kids only have one chance to grow up, and that I'll miss my chance if I keep slacking off.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: Of course it is! Haven't you seen someone suddenly grow taller while they're sleeping?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: It happens all the time! Though, I guess it does sound silly when you think about it...
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: Ugh, never mind. The longer I talk to you, the more you'll convince me otherwise...
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Besides, what's wrong with wanting a little more sleep? *yawn* See... I'm already crazy tired.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Exactly. At first, I only wanted to grow as fast as possible. But as I started sleeping more every day, the sleepier I became. The sleepier I became, the more I slept.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: Even right now, I'm awake and talking with you, but my brain still feels half asleep... Trust me, work is the last thing on my mind.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 19.ogg Sayu: Maybe you can help me! Even though I've been getting more sleep recently, I haven't gained any height at all. Any ideas?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 20.ogg Sayu: Yeah, I suppose I haven't kept up with my duties... I'm sorry, but...
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 21.ogg Sayu: *yawn* I really am getting sleepy...
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 22.ogg Sayu: It's because my work is just too boring. Transporting documents, organizing the ninja tools... As long as I don't do the work, no one will come asking me to do it again.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 23.ogg Sayu: The higher ups always give all the important tasks to more suitable operatives. They never even give me a second thought.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 24.ogg Sayu: Hmm. Now that you say that, I just had an idea.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 25.ogg Sayu: If you learn ninjutsu and help me with my tasks, then I can sleep peacefully and focus more on growing.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 26.ogg Sayu: Ninjutsu will come in super handy during your adventures. Don't worry, I'll personally teach you everything.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 27.ogg Sayu: If you work hard, then I'll work hard to teach you. See? This way, nobody is wasting time being lazy, hehe!
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 28.ogg Sayu: Thank you so much! See, you're the hero that protects Sayu's nap time!
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 29.ogg Sayu: We can start training as soon as the shrine maiden gets back.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 30a.ogg Sayu: The Traveler is interested in ninjutsu and wants to learn together.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 31.ogg Sayu: Huh? You're saying there's a way to grow taller while I'm awake, too?
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 32.ogg Sayu: Yes... You do have a point. Hmm.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 33.ogg Sayu: It's nothing compared to the adults. Just a little food is enough to make me full. I usually prefer eating fruit rather than those big, filling dishes.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 34.ogg Sayu: But I think I get it now... With more nutrients, people can grow bigger and taller. If anybody can eat a lot, it's the samurai. I should follow their example.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 35.ogg Sayu: Hehe, I guess. Let's head into town and find something to eat.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 36.ogg Sayu: We won't be able to go anywhere once she's around. Now's our only chance!

Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 37.ogg Sayu: Quality sleep is hard to come by, especially with the shrine maiden always after me... Not much I can do about that.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 38.ogg Sayu: Somehow, she knows all my favorite napping spots. Sometimes I wonder if she knows everything. *sigh* It's tough to throw her off my trail.
Media:vo zycop001 1901001 sayu 39.ogg Sayu: Anyway, let's go have a look around. *yawn* Maybe we can find a nice place to curl up for a nap.
