Konda Densuke: I've got a bad feeling about this somehow. It doesn't sound like what Vahid said last time. Are you sure there won't be any problems?

Konda Densuke: That's what Vahid told me last time, too. It should be alright. I'll wait for the crops to grow.

Vahid: You must first add crushed leaves to the fertilizer, before adding some water. Finally, mix them well and apply them to the field.

 Add crushed leaves first, then mix them, and add water at the end.
 Add crushed leaves, then add water, then mix them up.
 Add water first, then add crushed leaves before mixing them up.
 Could you repeat the process again?
 Don't you have Alrani to help you?
 I remember.
Vahid: Then I'm counting on you. Once you deliver the Anahitian Blessing to the customer, his first payment will be yours to keep.
 I'm here to talk about how to use the fertilizer.
 I'm not here to ask questions this time.
 Leave it to me.
Vahid: Excellent! We are counting on you, Traveler.
 Quest DescriptionVahid, the owner of Syavushi Bakshesh Shoppe, is currently having a headache over sales...
 So, tell me how to use the fertilizer...
 What is the matter?
 Where did Alrani go?
Vahid: She said that she needed to collect some materials and that she'll have to go quite far away.
Konda Densuke: Alright, tell me then. How should I use the fertilizer?
Konda Densuke: Heh, I guess it is still up to an old relic such as myself to restore the village. Those young lads from the village... Hmph! You can't count on them.
Konda Densuke: I heard about a novel fertilizer shop in Ritou. That's why I went to meet Mr. Vahid to try out his fertilizer.
Konda Densuke: I've got a bad feeling about this somehow. It doesn't sound like what Vahid said last time. Are you sure there won't be any problems?
Konda Densuke: If it works and increases crop production, there might be hope for restoring Konda Village.
Konda Densuke: Oh, did Vahid send you?
Konda Densuke: Such a complicated procedure for fertilizer... Alright, I've got it.
Konda Densuke: That's what Vahid told me last time, too. It should be alright. I'll wait for the crops to grow.
Konda Densuke: Youngsters, we meet again. What would you like to know this time?
Vahid: Alrani is already out there promoting our goods. I am going out later as well. Traveler, could you please help us out?
Vahid: And you know about the situation it Ritou. Nobody is buying anything.
Vahid: Anyway, even if it's just reciting the instructions, I believe I'll still need to run around and do some promotion.
Vahid: But why does no one here want to buy anything?
Vahid: But... I really don't understand such complex matters. And I'm not the one who created this fertilizer, so how can I possibly explain it?
Vahid: Don't get the order wrong, or it may cause problems, which will affect our customers' impression of us. Our future business is at stake...
Vahid: Excellent! We are counting on you, Traveler.
Vahid: I'm counting on you, Traveler... Let's all work hard. With any luck, business this month might be good!
Vahid: If you could promote some of our goods at his place and offer him a free trial, he might just buy some fertilizer.
Vahid: Now, let me see... according to the manual, the order should be...
Vahid: Oh yes, right, I haven't explained it to you yet. The fertilizer you are taking there must be used in a certain way.
Vahid: Oh, it's you, Traveler. *sigh* Forget it. I still cannot sell any fertilizer...
Vahid: She did help me out a little. But trouble is, neither of us knows how to promote these goods. We can only wait for the customers to show up...
Vahid: She said that she needed to collect some materials and that she'll have to go quite far away.
Vahid: Simply put, they want us to talk more about the fertilizer's effects and the theory behind it with customers. We should also do more data-driven promotion, and we should offer a "free trial" service...
Vahid: So I visited the gentlemen at the merchant guild to ask for help, and they suggested that we do something called marketing.
Vahid: The place you are going to is called Konda Village. It's not far from here.
Vahid: Then I'm counting on you. Once you deliver the Anahitian Blessing to the customer, his first payment will be yours to keep.
Vahid: There is a gentleman named Konda Densuke who has shown some interest in our fertilizer. He also came to the store to chat with me a little earlier.
Vahid: This business is so hard. All my merchandise is good and they're the real deal...
