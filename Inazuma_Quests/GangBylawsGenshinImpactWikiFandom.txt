 A little learning isn't going to be fatal.
 And my word is my bond.
 Because homies are family.
 Because our gang is our clan.
 Because you're my brother from another mother.
 Come on, it's not that bad.
 Dude. Not now.
 Fine, if she scares you that much, lemme help you hide...

 He'd still have to be very unlucky...
 How come you're here?
 I... uh...
 Is something on your mind?
 Kairagi might show up.
 No, come with me. I'll make sure Shinobu goes easy on you.

 Oh... That's unexpected...
 Quest DescriptionHaving heard that Shinobu is about to implement some special Gang Bylaws, Mamoru and the others flee as quickly as they can...
 Shinobu isn't here.
 Shinobu said it's not safe around here.
 Shinobu...
 Sure thing.
 The odds of Akira running into them are pretty low.
 These kids have more self-control than some people...
 They're visible from outside the box.
 Unlike some people, these kids know when enough is enough...
 Well, I'm not a member of the gang.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 10.ogg Akira: Ahem, well... friends should look out for each other too!
 What are you doing here?
 Whatcha looking at?
 Why do I get the feeling this happens all the time...
 Yeah, I know, I know.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 09.ogg Akira: Ah, nice! So you know how we roll, hehe!
Akira tries to squeeze himself into a box...

Media:vo jqrcop001 1914301 aikawasusumu 02.ogg Aikawa Susumu: I was just doing some cleaning when I suddenly heard a loud noise outside.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914301 aikawasusumu 03.ogg Aikawa Susumu: I got to the door just in time to see a shadowy figure disappear up that tree!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914301 aikawasusumu 04.ogg Aikawa Susumu: This is a busy street... Surely it wouldn't be a burglar, would it...?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914301 matsumoto 01.ogg Matsumoto: Did I see anyone come by this way? Sorry, I was concentrating on my lemon water tasting...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914301 matsumoto 02.ogg Matsumoto: Your best bet would probably be to ask someone at the bathhouse across the road.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914301 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Hmm? That's the owner of Aisa Bathhouse. What's he looking at?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 aikawasusumu 01.ogg Aikawa Susumu: Hey! What do you think you're doing, climbing up on someone else's roof?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 aikawasusumu 02.ogg Aikawa Susumu: *sigh* If you're gonna horse around, fine — but you have to know when to rein it in, okay?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 aikawasusumu 03.ogg Aikawa Susumu: It's darn lucky that you didn't break any roof tiles. Otherwise, I'd have to close the place down while I get it fixed...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 aikawasusumu 04.ogg Aikawa Susumu: It's okay, all's well that ends well. It's just, if you carry on like this, causing mischief day after day, night after night... Sooner or later, accidents are gonna happen.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 aikawasusumu 05.ogg Aikawa Susumu: I can see that you're a reasonable person. For your own sake, find a way to keep your subordinates in line.

Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 03.ogg Kuki Shinobu: We're very sorry. I will be much stricter with him in the future.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 04.ogg Kuki Shinobu: If, on closer inspection, you do find any damage, please come to Hanamizaka and ask for me. The Arataki Gang will bear the cost of repairs.

Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 06.ogg Kuki Shinobu: For the sake of both the Arataki Gang and the community, I will get them to start behaving themselves as a matter of urgency.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 07.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Listen carefully. From now on, you must strictly abide by the Gang Bylaws of the Arataki Gang.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 08.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Gang Bylaws, Article 1: Do not damage other people's property.

Including interest, of course.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 11.ogg Kuki Shinobu: As a further security, all of the offending member's gang assets, including Onikabuto and Genius Invokation TCG cards, will be frozen until the loan is repaid in full...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 12.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Good — then no more violations in the future. Now, where are Genta and Akira?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 13.ogg Kuki Shinobu: If they've violated the Gang Bylaws and you're withholding knowledge of their whereabouts, you'll be punished as an accomplice along with them.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 14.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Let's go, (Traveler). I hope they haven't caused any trouble.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914302 shinobu 15.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Shut up and get a move on. If you try and run away again, you'll only have yourself to blame for the consequences.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914304 eita 01.ogg Eita: We could try playing somewhere else. But where else apart from under the bridge can we escape from the grown-ups?

Media:vo jqrcop001 1914304 yuma 01.ogg Yuma: I think... maybe we should just go home and do our homework?
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914304 yuma 02.ogg Yuma: People who spend all their time playing and never studying turn into the kind of grown-ups who hang out under brigdes, too...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 eita 01.ogg Eita: It's so noisy over here, the grown-ups will definitely find us...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 eita 02.ogg Eita: If they find out that we came out to play cards before finishing our homework, we'll never be allowed to play again.

Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 genta 09.ogg Genta: He was heading out of the city! I saw it with my own eyes!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 genta 10.ogg Genta: When Shinobu gives me the look, I react automatically, I can't control it...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 genta 11.ogg Genta: Hey, uh, how did Shinobu find me so quickly? Mamoru... did you—
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 mamoru 01.ogg Mamoru: Huh? Cool, count me in! In the Arataki Gang, the victor shares the spoils... No, wait — brothers share our burdens! So, uh, punish us together!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 mamoru 02.ogg Mamoru: Never mind that, just listen!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 mamoru 03.ogg Mamoru: Ahem! As members of the Arataki Gang, we brothers share our burdens! If that means getting taught a lesson, then we take it as a team!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 mamoru 04.ogg Mamoru: Aw geez, I'm just so worried about Akira, you know? He could be in real trouble! Quick, we gotta catch up with him!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 shinobu 01.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Why are you still hiding here? Come on out.
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 shinobu 02.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Ugh... Sorry, we're coming up.

Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 shinobu 09.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Out of the city? A Doushin from the Police Station told me that things have been getting pretty rough out there recently...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 shinobu 10.ogg Kuki Shinobu: Let's go, (Traveler). Hopefully we can catch up with him.

Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 yuma 01.ogg Yuma: Besides, if we never do our homework and play Genius Invokation all the time...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914305 yuma 02.ogg Yuma: ...We'll probably turn into big losers when we grow up.

Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 07.ogg Akira: If I can squeeze myself inside one of them, Shinobu will never find me!
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 08.ogg Akira: ...Ah, don't sell me out, (Traveler)! Boss said our gang is our clan, and—

Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 13.ogg Akira: Hmm... Even if it's not, I still feel like I'd rather face a bunch of Kairagi than an angry Shinobu...
Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 14.ogg Akira: I ran so far this time, Shinobu's gonna be furious with me.... Yeah, I think I'd better stay in hiding for a while...

Media:vo jqrcop001 1914309 akira 16.ogg Akira: I guess with you there, maybe Shinobu really will let me off this time...
