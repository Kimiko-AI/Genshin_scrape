 ...and never be extinguished!
 A Dandelion Wine would sure be nice on a day like this...
 A bard's serenade would be perfect right now...
 A lot of people have supported you in the past.
 A lot of people out there sympathize with the position you're in.
 Ah yes, the real reason Paimon came along.
 At least, I didn't get the impression he was a local.
 But...
 Can you... reduce your prices?
 Can't you discuss the situation with the Kanjou Commission?
 Cheap 'n' tasty chop suey!
 Close your eyes...
 Come get a drink with your friends from the association.
 Context, Paimon, context...
 Doesn't anyone push back?
 Even if we did find Mora, we would give it to the trade association.
 Got it.
 Grilled Tiger Fish, get it while it's hot!
 I have one goal here: to meet the Raiden Shogun.
 I never offered to help.
 I refuse.
 I still have to find a way!
 I think it's about more than the Mora.
 I think perhaps not...
 I'll go back and talk to him again.
 It was the wind that led me back here to you.
 Let the Wind lead.
 Let's go talk to Thoma.
 Listen closely... doesn't it sound familiar...?
 Luckily, we had a friend with us.
 May the Anemo Archon protect you.
 May the flames of virtue spread to all...
 My journey must go on.
 Outlanders are unable to leave Ritou.
 Quest DescriptionYou arrive at Ritou in Inazuma smoothly and meet up with your contact, Thoma. But it seems that outlanders are far from welcome here...
 Reminds me of someone else's strange relationship with Mora...
 Seemed like a Mondstadter to me.
 So as her attendant... are we helping you or her...?
 So how would an outlander ever get to meet...
 So where did this "fixer of Ritou" thing come from?
 So, what's the job?
 Tell me about the Shirasagi Himegimi.
 Tell me about the Yashiro Commission.
 That is a major discount...
 That may well be...
 That title doesn't have any weight with these people.
 That's blatant oppression against outlanders...
 That's still quite expensive...
 The International Trade Association will protect you.
 The Raiden Shogun feels further away than ever...
 The fixer works in mysterious ways...
 The vendor does sounds [sic] like a fishy character.
 There is one problem...
 This is absurd treatment.
 This must be the next part of his "test."
 Time on your hands... Some would call that a form of freedom.
 Time to get the real fixer on the case...
 Try our best to negotiate with the Kanjou Commission?
Media:vo dqaq002 5 paimon 08a.ogg Paimon: But Kurisu's the head of the association and even he hasn't had any luck. Not to mention, we're outlanders too...
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 19a.ogg Kurisu: Right, and besides... I think this may well be the fate they've ordained for us.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 paimon 08a 1.ogg Paimon: Okay, well we could try tackling the problem by going to the other party involved...
 Very nearly...
 We are here to find my (sister/brother).
Media:vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 04b.ogg Kageyama: Oh? Well, I'm sorry. We cannot approve entry for purely personal reasons. So, unless you have a valid reason for visiting in accordance with the rules...
 We are here to... trade wine. And ore.
Media:vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 04a.ogg Kageyama: Currently, only members of the International Trade Association are authorized to engage in the import and export of goods. Do you have your trader's permits?
 We need evidence.
 Welcome or not, we don't have a choice.
 What do you know about Werner?
 Where do you source your goods?
 Who are "those people"?
 Yes, we just arrived.
 You don't recognize me? But I'm the fixer 'round these parts!
Media:vo dqaq002 7 werner 02b.ogg Werner: Haha, very funny. Real "Fixers" don't need to refer to themselves that way. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
 You're going to have to help us help you.
 You're the one making a mockery of the rules here, Keijirou!
(Follow Keijirou to Ryouko's stall)
(Talk to Werner again)
Kurisu reads through each and every item in the ledger.
Media:vo dialog dqaq002 harrison 01.ogg Harrison: It's tyranny — plain and simple...
Media:vo dialog dqaq002 kurisu 01.ogg Kurisu: I can't thank you enough for helping me out. If you've got no place to go, you're always welcome at the International Trade Association.
Media:vo dialog dqaq002 kurisu 02.ogg Kurisu: Thank you so much, our heads are back above water now...
Media:vo dialog dqaq002 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Kurisu will reach his wits' end if things carry on like they are. Go see what you can do for him.
Media:vo dialog dqaq002 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Something tells me you've come up with a smart way to solve this...
Media:vo dialog dqaq002 werner 01.ogg Werner: Hmph. I'm the only lifeline they've got. How dare they try and bargain with me!
Media:vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 01.ogg Kageyama: Hello, please state your name, identity, and the purpose of your visit. Oh, except you, Thoma.
Media:vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 02.ogg Kageyama: You must be... new here.
Media:vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 03.ogg Kageyama: Excuse me? Please provide the information requested, and also declare any goods you are carrying with you.
Media:vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 04a.ogg Kageyama: Currently, only members of the International Trade Association are authorized to engage in the import and export of goods. Do you have your trader's permits?
Media:vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 04b.ogg Kageyama: Oh? Well, I'm sorry. We cannot approve entry for purely personal reasons. So, unless you have a valid reason for visiting in accordance with the rules...
Media:vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 05.ogg Kageyama: My apologies, but I'll have to ask you to—
Media:vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 06.ogg Kageyama: ...I see, okay. Your papers are all in order. Welcome to Ritou.
Media:vo dqaq002 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Heh...
Media:vo dqaq002 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Um... uh... w—we—uh...
Media:vo dqaq002 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What!? Ugh, take your time! No rush or anything!
Media:vo dqaq002 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Pheeeew...
Media:vo dqaq002 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So, where do we go next?
Media:vo dqaq002 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Sheesh, so it is super strict, just like everyone says.
Media:vo dqaq002 1 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Here are their entry papers, for your kind perusal.
Media:vo dqaq002 1 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Haha, I just wanted to see what you'd say... sorry about that.
Media:vo dqaq002 1 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: The Outlander Affairs Agency.
Media:vo dqaq002 1 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: They only check entry permits here. If you want to remain on Ritou, there's a process you have to go through with them.
Media:vo dqaq002 1 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Well, let's not forget that to everyday folk in Inazuma, people from everywhere else are referred to as "outsiders."
Media:vo dqaq002 1 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: As the word suggests, outlanders aren't very welcome in Inazuma with the Sakoku Decree in force.
Media:vo dqaq002 1 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: Not even on Ritou, where they've established an Outsider Settlement.
Media:vo dqaq002 1 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Hehe, I like how you think. I've got a feeling we're going to get along very well.
Media:vo dqaq002 1 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: Now. Let's head over to the Outlander Affairs Agency.
Media:vo dqaq002 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ooh, it's working...
Media:vo dqaq002 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Just close your eyes already!
Media:vo dqaq002 11 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: This guy has a really active imagination... either that or he really does miss Liyue Harbor...
Media:vo dqaq002 11 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Um... well, no one's stopping you, so...
Media:vo dqaq002 11 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: You're ready to talk now?
Media:vo dqaq002 11 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Ugh, c'mon you scaredy-cat! Look, you messed up, but now it's time to make things right!
Media:vo dqaq002 11 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: So, come on, get it off your chest. What's the deal here?
Media:vo dqaq002 11 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: It's just... it's plain evil, gouging them like this.
Media:vo dqaq002 11 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Really? Well, then there's no time to lose! Let's go.
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 01.ogg Werner: What are you doing back here? Just 'cause I got plenty of time on my hands doesn't mean I want to waste any of it talking to you.
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 02.ogg Werner: Huh? Where's this coming from...
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 03.ogg Werner: ...Mondstadt... You're talking about... Mondstadt?
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 04.ogg Werner: Goodness, I can sense it now. So familiar, but I can't remember the last time I was there...
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 05.ogg Werner: Ah, the scent of Mondstadt... Oh, how it takes me back...
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 06.ogg Werner: *sigh* My hometown... The home of freedom...! How I long to go back and visit...
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 07.ogg Werner: Ah... Oh — ahem! So, trying to play my heartstrings like a lyre are you? I know what you're up to.
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 08.ogg Werner: Huh? What is this, what are you up to now?
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 09.ogg Werner: You mean... the sound of the ocean?
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 10.ogg Werner: *gasp* Liyue Harbor! I can see it so clearly! Oh, and the sound of the waves, the calls of the merchants...
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 11.ogg Werner: Xiao Lanterns! Haha, I'm right there, at the Lantern Rite! Oh... look at them, floating up into the sky!
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 12.ogg Werner: *sigh* Liyue, Liyue...
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 13.ogg Werner: Wait... Stop, that's enough... Don't make me relive it any more, my poor heart can't take it...
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 14.ogg Werner: You mean... the folks from the International Trade Association... And I suppose they are far from home, just like me.
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 15.ogg Werner: Often, I'll sneak down to the shore at night and listen to the sound of the waves... I like to imagine it's the voice of my hometown, carried across the ocean.
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 16.ogg Werner: I've run into folks from the association more than a few times doing just that, but I always hide my face and slip away...
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 17.ogg Werner: *sigh* Don't you think I've wanted to talk things through with them, and free myself from this anguish?
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 18.ogg Werner: They're so resilient. None of them had anyone else to rely on, so they rallied together, committed to finding a way to survive... But I couldn't do it, I'm not strong enough...
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 19.ogg Werner: So... I caved... Those people, they'd make the smallest of promises, offer the most measly benefits, and I'd do whatever they asked of me... and make Mondstadters look like the worst people in the world...
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 20.ogg Werner: ...Alright, I'll tell you the whole story. It's eating me up inside and I can't take it anymore.
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 21.ogg Werner: But I betrayed them... I can't show my face there...
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 22.ogg Werner: It's a scheme by the tax-collection ashigaru. Keijirou and his companions.
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 23.ogg Werner: They start by overtaxing the merchants, then take the extra Crystal Marrow they receive and stockpile it.
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 24.ogg Werner: Once the merchants run out of places to buy Crystal Marrow, they get me to sell that extra stock back to the merchants at an extortionate price, with the proceeds going to the tax-collection ashigaru.
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 25.ogg Werner: I'm their puppet, yes... but my cut is a tiny fraction of what we take in total. It's barely enough for me to live on.
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 26.ogg Werner: Evidence? Hmm... You're right, without conclusive evidence, he will never admit it.
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 27.ogg Werner: Now that I think about it, whenever I report back to him after a sale, he always heads to the same place. It's always made me suspicious...
Media:vo dqaq002 11 werner 28.ogg Werner: As it happens, I handed some Mora over to him not long ago. I can show you where he went if you want.
Media:vo dqaq002 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: After him!
Media:vo dqaq002 12 werner 01.ogg Werner: Keijirou! It's him!
Media:vo dqaq002 13 keijirou 01.ogg Keijirou: Ah, Ryouko. How's business?
Media:vo dqaq002 13 keijirou 02.ogg Keijirou: Good! Thankfully, I earn plenty these days...
Media:vo dqaq002 13 keijirou 03.ogg Keijirou: Now, who else is behind on payments?
Media:vo dqaq002 13 keijirou 04.ogg Keijirou: Let me think... yes, the trade association clique still need to be brought into line.
(He starts running off, making you chase after him)
Media:vo dqaq002 13 keijirou 05.ogg Keijirou: Hm? What was that sound...
Media:vo dqaq002 13 keijirou 06.ogg Keijirou: Must be hearing things. Drat, I'm behind schedule. I need to hurry...
Media:vo dqaq002 13 keijirou 07.ogg Keijirou: Come out. I can see you.
Media:vo dqaq002 13 keijirou 08.ogg Keijirou: Who are you, and why are you following me?
Media:vo dqaq002 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Shh... Quiet! Don't let him find us!
Media:vo dqaq002 13 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh, seems like he's noticed us...
(Return to the starting position and try again)
Media:vo dqaq002 13 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? Where'd he go?
Media:vo dqaq002 13 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: He was right there a moment ago... Seems he disappeared in the blink of an eye.
Media:vo dqaq002 13 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: If only we'd made less noise..
(Return to the starting position and try again)
Media:vo dqaq002 13 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: He's getting further and further away. Let's catch up a little.
(If Keijirou gets out of sight)
Media:vo dqaq002 13 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Too close, that's too close! He'll notice us for sure!
(If Keijirou spots you)
Media:vo dqaq002 13 ryouko 01.ogg Ryouko: Heh... All the better thanks to your generous patronage.
Media:vo dqaq002 13 ryouko 02.ogg Ryouko: But of course, tax collection is difficult work.
(Keijirou walks away from the stall)
Media:vo dqaq002 14 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It looked like he buried something over there, didn't it? Why don't we take a look?
Media:vo dqaq002 14 werner 01.ogg Werner: What could he be doing at a place like this...
Media:vo dqaq002 15 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa, it's... a ledger...
Media:vo dqaq002 15 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Boring... Paimon thought he'd hidden a big pile of Mora here.
Media:vo dqaq002 15 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ehehe, yeah...
Media:vo dqaq002 15 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Great! Well, now we have our hard evidence, let's go tell Kurisu the good news, shall we?
Media:vo dqaq002 15 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh? You aren't gonna come with us?
Media:vo dqaq002 15 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: *sigh* Poor Werner's a pretty awkward guy, huh...
Media:vo dqaq002 15 werner 01.ogg Werner: Let me take a look here...
Media:vo dqaq002 15 werner 02.ogg Werner: Aha, yes. This is what we're looking for. A clear and complete record of every single transaction, each one proof of his guilt.
Media:vo dqaq002 15 werner 03.ogg Werner: Ah, um... I—I'll say goodbye to you here, then.
Media:vo dqaq002 15 werner 04.ogg Werner: I... I need a little more time before I'm ready to face the head of the association. I'm sorry.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 harrison 01.ogg Harrison: You've been swindling us!
Media:vo dqaq002 17 harrison 02.ogg Harrison: So that's it!? My shop's been closed for weeks now — I've even had to ask my friends to help bail me out! What about my losses!?
Media:vo dqaq002 17 harrison 03.ogg Harrison: I'm sick of being pushed around like this! I won't let him off so easily!
Media:vo dqaq002 17 harrison 04.ogg Harrison: A helping hand!? The only thing you're doing is stuffing your greedy pockets with our hard-earned wealth. I assure you that Hiiragi Shinsuke will hear of this!
Media:vo dqaq002 17 katsuie 01.ogg Katsuie: Hey! What's all this racket? Does someone dare question the decree?
Media:vo dqaq002 17 katsuie 02.ogg Katsuie: What was all the commotion I heard just now?
Media:vo dqaq002 17 katsuie 03.ogg Katsuie: Oh? And you dare to utter the Commissioner's name? You outlanders have no respect for the rules.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 katsuie 04.ogg Katsuie: Seize the merchants! We will resolve this dispute back at headquarters!
Media:vo dqaq002 17 katsuie 05.ogg Katsuie: Huh... you're from the Yashiro Commission?
Media:vo dqaq002 17 katsuie 06.ogg Katsuie: Hmph, well, this is Kanjou Commission territory. However powerful the Yashiro Commission may be, you have no business meddling in Ritou's affairs.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 katsuie 07.ogg Katsuie: That fan... the Shirasagi Himegimi.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 katsuie 08.ogg Katsuie: ...I don't need any trouble with her. Okay, let's forget all this. It'll give us one less thing to worry about.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 katsuie 09.ogg Katsuie: Enough! We're leaving.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 keijirou 01.ogg Keijirou: You know the decree. The rules are the rules. No discounts, no exceptions — and no excuses!
Media:vo dqaq002 17 keijirou 02.ogg Keijirou: Hmm? And who are you? Another new member of the association?
Media:vo dqaq002 17 keijirou 03.ogg Keijirou: Well, uh... You see... The t—taxes, uh...
Media:vo dqaq002 17 keijirou 04.ogg Keijirou: Hmph! So you think you can use this against me do you? I—It's quite obvious that I'm merely trying to earn a modest living for myself, like anyone else...!
Media:vo dqaq002 17 keijirou 05.ogg Keijirou: Huh? Is that a threat? Are you threatening me!?
Media:vo dqaq002 17 keijirou 06.ogg Keijirou: Uhh... W—Well even if what you say is true, what do you suggest we do about it...?
Media:vo dqaq002 17 keijirou 07.ogg Keijirou: Hmph, do you have any idea the hoops I had to jump through to get the Crystal Marrow and keep it hidden!? Ugh, fine! In that case, I'll send it over to you today.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 keijirou 08.ogg Keijirou: Ah, Chief. You've arrived.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 keijirou 09.ogg Keijirou: Oh, we were just discussing a minor tax issue. I do my utmost to lend them a helping hand, but they're never grateful.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 keijirou 10.ogg Keijirou: Who are you supposed to be? And why in my right mind would I join you for a drink?
Media:vo dqaq002 17 keijirou 11.ogg Keijirou: But Chief...
Media:vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 01.ogg Kurisu: But we really don't have anything left. If this keeps up, our sales will come in at a loss. There'll be nothing left for us to do but starve...
Media:vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 02.ogg Kurisu: Huh? Is this true!?
Media:vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 03.ogg Kurisu: Let me take a look at the ledger.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 04.ogg Kurisu: Well would you look at that... Every payment the association has made is right here in your personal ledger.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 05.ogg Kurisu: So, Mr. Keijirou, it seems you have some explaining to do. How shall we settle this, hmm?
Media:vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 06.ogg Kurisu: Word has it that samurai in the commission place great importance on reputation and prestige... Though, I'm sure commission members won't blame you once word gets out...
Media:vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 07.ogg Kurisu: No, not at all. I'm simply stating that it would be quite a pity if an illustrious gentleman such as yourself were to have their reputation tarnished.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 08.ogg Kurisu: I believe you still have a quantity of Crystal Marrow in your possession, correct?
Media:vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 09.ogg Kurisu: Perhaps that Crystal Marrow could be used as compensation for the recent tax hike, and us merchants could finally have some more breathing room.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 10.ogg Kurisu: Come on, Harrison! We've already struck a good deal here...
Media:vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 11.ogg Kurisu: Harrison!
Media:vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 12.ogg Kurisu: Thank you so much, Thoma... But I'm sorry your relationship with the Kanjou Commission had to suffer for our sake...
Media:vo dqaq002 17 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It just so happens that we found your little ledger. So now we're here to tell everyone all about how you embezzled Crystal Marrow to sell it right back to the tax payers!
Media:vo dqaq002 17 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Is that it?
Media:vo dqaq002 17 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: And not even an ounce of shame for his actions...
Media:vo dqaq002 17 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh, this is going in a bad direction...
Media:vo dqaq002 17 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Ha! You never heard of the fixer!?
Media:vo dqaq002 17 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Thoma... what was all that—
Media:vo dqaq002 17 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Gentlemen, gentlemen. Come now, is there any need for this? If there's a dispute to resolve, let's get a drink and talk it over.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Here's my card...
Media:vo dqaq002 17 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Shh...
Media:vo dqaq002 17 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Of course not. Of course not. Still, perhaps you could show the young lady of our clan some courtesy...
Media:vo dqaq002 17 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: You wouldn't want your names showing up in a petition to the shogun, would you?
Media:vo dqaq002 17 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Let's get dinner one day soon, gentlemen. My treat. I insist.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: Eh, no response, huh... I suppose that bridge is well and truly burned, then.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 thoma 08a.ogg Media:vo dqaq002 17 thoma 08b.ogg Thoma: Haha. Hey, hey, I was joking. It's a small price to pay and you're more than welcome. If there's anyone you should be thanking, it's the Traveler. (He/She)'s the one who found a way to turn things around.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: If nothing else, I'm sure the tax-collection ashigaru will tread a little more carefully in future.
Media:vo dqaq002 17 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: Shh... Not here, too many people listening, haha. Let's move somewhere else.
Media:vo dqaq002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: The Kanjou Commission?
Media:vo dqaq002 2 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Most of the current rules were put in place by the administration of Ritou — the Kanjou Commission.
Media:vo dqaq002 2 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Yes, one branch of the Tri-Commission of Inazuma. Responsible for growing and managing the nation's wealth. Um... you really haven't heard of it before?
Media:vo dqaq002 20 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ugh, you've been keeping your true identity a secret from us this whole time!
Media:vo dqaq002 20 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So, the Yashiro Commission. Guessing that's another branch of the Tri-Commission?
Media:vo dqaq002 20 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Seems like she must be super-famous in Inazuma, given the reaction of those guys just now.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Still pretty good going for just a month's work!
Media:vo dqaq002 20 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Change the tide of the times?
Media:vo dqaq002 20 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Huh, Thoma sure didn't put up much of a fight...
Media:vo dqaq002 20 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Thoma's not such a bad guy, huh. We should get going.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Huh? What's up?
Media:vo dqaq002 20 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Oh, right! Paimon forgot all about that!
Media:vo dqaq002 20 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Wait, so... did Thoma forget that, too?
Media:vo dqaq002 20 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Darn it! Grr, no wonder he was so matter-of-fact about the whole thing!
Media:vo dqaq002 20 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: As soon as we get off Ritou, Paimon's going straight to Komore Teahouse to settle the score!
Media:vo dqaq002 20 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Ugh, well, guess we should give it a try. Let's head to the border and see how far we get.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Corruption seems rife in the Kanjou Commission, they truly are rotten to the core... *sigh*
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Alright. Time for me to answer your questions. What would you like to know?
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Haha, straight to the point. Let me re-introduce myself.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: I belong to the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission on Narukami Island. I'm an attendant of the Shirasagi Himegimi.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Correct. The Kamisato Clan is the head of the Yashiro Commission, who manage ceremonial and cultural affairs. I'd go into more detail on what exactly that covers, but I'm not even sure myself.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: I'm just someone who was fortunate enough to be taken in by the Kamisato Clan. My role is to take care of the daughter of the clan — Kamisato Ayaka, also known as the Shirasagi Himegimi.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: Hahaha... Oh, most definitely. She's graceful, dignified, and kind-hearted, too. The people of Inazuma quite adore Miss Kamisato.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Her fame even somewhat eclipses that of her older brother, Kamisato Ayato, despite the fact that he is the current head of the clan.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: I suppose those who treat others with compassion earn themselves the same treatment in return. Miss Kamisato's situation certainly seems to attest to that. Take me, for example — I'm just an attendant, and yet she treats me as an equal, as she would a friend.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: You're asking the right questions. And to be honest, I don't want to keep you in the dark any more than is necessary.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Firstly, you should know that being a fixer is not something you can fake. I spent the better part of a month tirelessly building up a network of relationships on the island, and I got to know Captain Beidou during that time, too.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: Haha, well, maybe I have a slight knack for schmoozery. But the main thing was, I had to make sure I'd be in time to receive you when you arrived.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: Inazuma may have closed off to the outside world, but that hasn't stopped a lot of people from hearing about your feats in Mondstadt and Liyue.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: So, when Miss Kamisato heard of your intention to come to Inazuma, she began looking forward to your arrival with great anticipation. She's excited to find out whether the rumors are true...
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: ...that is, that you have what it takes to change the tide of the times.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: In the test that I gave you earlier, although there were a few hiccups at the end, it was you who found the way to turn the situation around.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 17.ogg Thoma: Navigating powerful people, using their character flaws to your advantage... it's just what Miss Kamisato had hoped to see.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 18.ogg Thoma: With your help... even the Vision Hunt Decree—
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 19.ogg Thoma: ...Ah.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 20.ogg Thoma: Hmm, that's an unexpected development. Perhaps our sources were misleading...
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 21.ogg Thoma: ...Yes, of course. I completely understand, and as agreed, I shall help set that up for you.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 22.ogg Thoma: Hah... Well, my work on Ritou is done, so I suppose this is goodbye for now.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 23.ogg Thoma: Oh, one more thing — this Invitation Letter is for you... When you get to Narukami Island, you can find me at Komore Teahouse, as per the letter.
Media:vo dqaq002 20 thoma 24.ogg Thoma: Good luck with everything. See you soon.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yes, please!
Media:vo dqaq002 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: T—Two million! For a processing fee? Are you serious!?
Media:vo dqaq002 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Paimon wasn't so much questioning your math as... Ugh...
Media:vo dqaq002 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: That's not how you haggle! By all means, bargain the price down, but—
Media:vo dqaq002 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: What!? She went from two million down to 600? There's something seriously wrong with people's sense of finance around here!
Media:vo dqaq002 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Then they'll milk them for all they're worth!
Media:vo dqaq002 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: So it's a trade association built by and for outlanders?
Media:vo dqaq002 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: *sigh* Sounds like just stayin' alive is an achievement when you're an outlander in Inazuma...
Media:vo dqaq002 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Uh-huh... And is that likely...?
Media:vo dqaq002 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Really!? Wow, the Ritou fixer is better connected than we thought!
Media:vo dqaq002 3 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Ugh, not you too!
Media:vo dqaq002 3 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Sounds very reasonable to Paimon! You're the man in the middle, so you have to trade favors to keep everyone indebted to you.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Hahaha... Ma'am, these two here are good friends of mine. I think you'll find I'm one face you recognize.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Thank you ever so much, Miss Yurika.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: But as this is just a processing fee... I think 600 Mora should cover it if I'm paying on their behalf? I'll treat you to dinner, too. How does that sound?
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Hee-hee, much obliged.
(Yurika leads the three inside the building.)
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Hehe, it's not as mind-boggling as you think. "Processing fee" is just a figure of speech.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: The way some here at the agency see it, the fees are easy money, so it becomes a question of how much they can make.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: So when the day comes that some poor merchant from overseas with more money than sense gets stuck here and needs to apply for residency...
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Exactly. It's at times like this that having a local friend really comes in handy.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: Yes, but when you're an outlander in Inazuma, far from home, in this closed-nation era, there's very little that can be done about it.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: The most that overseas merchants can do to look after themselves is stick together.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: That's how the International Trade Association came about.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: Yep, and as well as advancing commercial interests, the association provides help, support, and structure for outlanders trying to survive on Ritou.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: Essentially, it's an association devoted to both commercial excellence and survival skills.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: I see... so this is the real purpose of your trip. Yes, given that you are outlanders, it's certainly a lofty aspiration.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: After all, the Raiden Shogun is the most exalted and revered one in all of Inazuma. She is a deity who reigns on high, while all other life gazes up in awe.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: ...
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 17.ogg Thoma: I was going to say, nothing is set in stone when it comes to who you will encounter in this world. Who's to say you won't happen to run into the Raiden Shogun one day after lunch...
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 18.ogg Thoma: Okay, I'll give it to you straight. I know of a way to introduce you to the Raiden Shogun.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 19.ogg Thoma: Ahem, hehe — I mean, it will take all the resources I have at my disposal, but it can be done. However, before we get there...
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 20.ogg Thoma: Connections come at a high price, you understand?
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 21.ogg Thoma: Hahaha! No, no... In this instance, when I say price, I'm not talking about Mora.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 22.ogg Thoma: In fact, there's no real cost, as such. It's just that... if this is something you really want, you'll have to agree to help other people solve some of their problems first.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 23.ogg Thoma: I like to do things in a way that keeps everybody happy. It's my own personal rule for dealing with situations like this.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 24.ogg Thoma: Heh... Why do I get the feeling you're making me out to be some sort of crook... Uh, never mind.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 25.ogg Thoma: Here's the situation. As I touched upon earlier, the members of the International Trade Association are constantly struggling to survive.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 26.ogg Thoma: Recently, things seem to have gotten more difficult than ever for them. So just go and check things out, see if there's any way you can help.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 thoma 27.ogg Thoma: The head of the association is called Kurisu, and he's a good friend of mine. Go talk to him, I'll wait for you here.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 yurika 01.ogg Yurika: You've completed the entry procedures, yes? And now you want to apply for residency? Both of you?
Media:vo dqaq002 3 yurika 02.ogg Yurika: Okay. The processing fee will be two million Mora.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 yurika 03.ogg Yurika: That's right, one million per applicant, which makes two million total. Don't worry, you can trust my math.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 yurika 04.ogg Yurika: Ah, Mr. Thoma, it's you. By way of courtesy, allow me to reduce it to 400,000 Mora total.
Media:vo dqaq002 3 yurika 05.ogg Yurika: Alright then. As you wish, Mr. Thoma. I will make a record.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 01.ogg Kurisu: Oh? Hello there, you must be seeking refuge with the International Trade Association. The Outlander Affairs Agency took you for all you're worth, I suppose.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 02.ogg Kurisu: Ah, good, that's a relief. *sigh* ...You need to be careful, or you'll find yourself losing your savings all at once.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 03.ogg Kurisu: Yes... left, right, and center. Obstacles at every turn. But that's nothing new for us.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 04.ogg Kurisu: But it's not the root cause of our woes. The Sakoku Decree might restrict our scope of activity, but in and of itself it doesn't stop us from being able to enjoy a comfortable existence.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 05.ogg Kurisu: No, what's really squeezing us outlander merchants dry is...
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 06.ogg Kurisu: ...those Mora-grubbers from the Kanjou Commission.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 07.ogg Kurisu: That's right. They impose astronomical tax rates, unbelievable regulations, and that's not the worst of it...
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 08.ogg Kurisu: They just issued a new Tax Decree recently that, for some reason, completely changes the way we pay our taxes. It used to be Mora, but now it's something called Crystal Marrow.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 09.ogg Kurisu: Something that most of us in the association had never heard of before either, until the new decree came along.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 10.ogg Kurisu: Eventually, one of the older Liyue merchants recalled that he once shipped a batch of it to Snezhnaya in his youth.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 11.ogg Kurisu: So in order to pay our taxes, we began an arduous search for this Crystal Marrow.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 12.ogg Kurisu: But then we found we'd only managed to create a bigger problem for ourselves. The rising demand for Crystal Marrow drove the price higher and higher...
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 13.ogg Kurisu: Now, there's only one vendor who even has it in stock. We can't get hold of it anywhere else...
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 14.ogg Kurisu: Exactly. So this vendor keeps pushing the price up, and we have no choice but to buy from them because the Tax Decree forces us to...
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 15.ogg Kurisu: It's a vicious cycle, the consequence of which is that our taxes will soon exceed our profits... and once that happens...
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 16.ogg Kurisu: We've tried communicating with the commission directly...
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 17.ogg Kurisu: But this is a nation where the cries of a few struggling merchants will never be heard over the ever-present roar of thunder...
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 18.ogg Kurisu: *sigh* Fontaine, my dear homeland... I miss you an awful lot at the moment...
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 19a.ogg Kurisu: Right, and besides... I think this may well be the fate they've ordained for us.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 19b.ogg Kurisu: *sigh* That vendor...
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 20.ogg Kurisu: I've actually done business with him in the past, but after a point, he stopped contacting us. I have no idea where he sources the stuff...
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 21.ogg Kurisu: Hey, that's a pretty good idea! Since you're not affiliated with the association and you're new to Ritou, he may just let his guard down.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 22.ogg Kurisu: If I remember correctly, our usual meeting point with him is under a tree by the coast in the residential district. See if you can find him there.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We heard the association has been having some difficulties lately. Is that true?
Media:vo dqaq002 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: The Sakoku Decree certainly makes things difficult for anyone who wants to come here from overseas.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, of the three Commissions, that's the one that oversees everything on Ritou, isn't it?
Media:vo dqaq002 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Crystal Marrow...? What's that?
Media:vo dqaq002 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Uh... isn't that what they call a monopoly?
Media:vo dqaq002 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Sounds awful, they're really bleeding them dry.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: (Traveler), what do you think we should do?
Media:vo dqaq002 5 paimon 08a 1.ogg Paimon: Okay, well we could try tackling the problem by going to the other party involved...
Media:vo dqaq002 5 paimon 08a.ogg Paimon: But Kurisu's the head of the association and even he hasn't had any luck. Not to mention, we're outlanders too...
Media:vo dqaq002 5 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Well, it definitely sounds like he's being unfair. How do we find him? We could go talk to him and see if he lets anything slip.
Media:vo dqaq002 5 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Got it! We're on the case!
Media:vo dqaq002 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: This guy's got a bad attitude...
Media:vo dqaq002 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hey, what's your problem!?
Media:vo dqaq002 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What are we gonna do? There's no talking to this guy...
Media:vo dqaq002 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Good idea. Let's check back in with him.
Media:vo dqaq002 7 werner 01.ogg Werner: Hm? I don't think I recognize you, are you new arrivals?
Media:vo dqaq002 7 werner 02b.ogg Werner: Haha, very funny. Real "Fixers" don't need to refer to themselves that way. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
Media:vo dqaq002 7 werner 03.ogg Werner: So. What do you need with me?
Media:vo dqaq002 7 werner 04.ogg Werner: The sheer nerve! You don't go around asking questions like that! If I gave you my sources, I might as well hand you the whole darn business!
Media:vo dqaq002 7 werner 05.ogg Werner: Trade secret, got it? You know what "trade" and "secret" mean, right? Tsk.
Media:vo dqaq002 7 werner 06.ogg Werner: Hah! Are you even buying!? ...Ohh, I see what's going on here. Kurisu and his associates sent you here to try and plead their case, didn't they?
Media:vo dqaq002 7 werner 07.ogg Werner: Heh, they're wasting their time. The price is non-negotiable, not by a single Mora.
Media:vo dqaq002 7 werner 08.ogg Werner: Get out of here, go on. Tell them they're lucky to be buying from me in the first place, and they ought to be more grateful. If it weren't for me, they'd be in seriously hot water.
Media:vo dqaq002 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Um, actually we're having a little trouble...
Media:vo dqaq002 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? You're saying he used to be a member of the International Trade Association? So he's an outlander, too?
Media:vo dqaq002 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh, what a bummer...
Media:vo dqaq002 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: So, he left the association and turned his back on them!
Media:vo dqaq002 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Really? Is that all you need to know?
Media:vo dqaq002 9 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Hm? That was quick... You resolved it already?
Media:vo dqaq002 9 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Oh? Well, by all means, tell me what you need. I'll help as much as I can.
Media:vo dqaq002 9 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Getting you to go fixing things when you've only just arrived is quite a demand.
Media:vo dqaq002 9 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Oh, that guy? I'm familiar.
Media:vo dqaq002 9 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: He used to be a bit of a sorry sight, selling shells that he'd collect on the beach just to get by. But he seems to have suddenly shot up in the world recently.
Media:vo dqaq002 9 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: I can only assume he must have found himself a patron after leaving the International Trade Association.
Media:vo dqaq002 9 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: Yes... couldn't you tell when you spoke to him?
Media:vo dqaq002 9 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: That's right, Werner was born in Mondstadt, then went into the shipping business, trading between Liyue and Inazuma.
Media:vo dqaq002 9 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: When Inazuma closed to the outside world, he was one of a group of outlanders that ended up stranded on Ritou.
Media:vo dqaq002 9 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: The International Trade Association was initially very generous to him, but over time, with decree after decree, the association members found it increasingly difficult to make ends meet...
Media:vo dqaq002 9 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Haha, I'm sure it's more nuanced than that. I believe even the most ungrateful and cold-hearted of people still have some amount of gratitude and warmth left in them somewhere.
Media:vo dqaq002 9 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: Well then, it sounds like you may have found a way in with him.
The residency application is processed smoothly at the Outlander Affairs Agency
(Thoma, Paimon, and the Traveler leave for the entrance to the Agency.)
