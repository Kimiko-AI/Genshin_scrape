 (I'll ask around at the Yashiro Commission...)
 I agree. Let them do them, and you do you.
 I agree. Let them do them, and you do you.
(Go to Branch 1)
 It makes me uncomfortable.
 Let's leave them be...
 Quest DescriptionAt Thoma's invitation, you come to the Yashiro Commission, only to hear two samurai talking about him behind his back...
 Sorry, I can't say I agree.
 Sorry, I can't say I agree.
(Go to Branch 2)
 Time to put a stop to this...
 We should tell them how much you do for the Commission.
 You heard everything... didn't you?
Before you can respond, you hear footsteps coming up behind you...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 furusawa 01.ogg Furusawa: Probably something of the utmost importance, as ever... taking guests out for lavish meals, cleaning up around the house, the usual...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 furusawa 02.ogg Furusawa: Oh, well, no wonder. What do you think Miss Kamisato even sees in that guy?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 kazumasa 01.ogg Kazumasa: Haven't seen Thoma in a while... Who knows what that guy's working on these days?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 kazumasa 02.ogg Kazumasa: We have people like that to thank for the decline of the samurai spirit in this day and age. If you're just gonna schmooze your way through every problem in life, you might as well put your blade on the scrap heap. It's like everything — use it or lose it!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 kazumasa 03.ogg Kazumasa: Also, I heard he's Mondstadt born and bred... just saying.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 kazumasa 04.ogg Kazumasa: Hmph... we were just having a little chat on our break. It's time we were going — there's still lots to do.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 kazumasa 05.ogg Kazumasa: We're busy people, Thoma. You'd do well to grow a sense of urgency, too.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: *yawn*... Sorry, haven't slept too well the last couple of days on account of all this rain we've been having.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Wait, what're you all doing here? Has something happened?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Thank you gentlemen. I'll think about that when my vacation's over.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Sorry I'm a little late, (Traveler), something came up.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Yep... I sure did.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: No big deal, though. People like to criticize those who don't fit in. It's the same everywhere.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: If a little private gossiping helps them let off some steam, well, good for them. It does no harm to the Kamisato Clan.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Wouldn't you agree?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: Exactly. Or live and let live, as they say.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: Today it's time for a hard-earned rest. There's been so much to deal with since I got out of Komore Teahouse — this vacation's been a long time coming.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: There's too much going on here. Let's find somewhere more peaceful to discuss the plan for the day.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: You're still my guest, after all, and I'd like to hear your ideas.
(Proceed to Host's Invitation)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: Oh?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: I'm touched that that's how you see the situation.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: I don't think we need to go down that route, though... in any case, as a housekeeper, it's hardly my place to get all high and mighty with other staff in the Yashiro Commission.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: But you're my guest and I live to serve, so if you have any other thoughts on the matter, please do share them with me.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 17.ogg Thoma: I'm willing to give anything you suggest a shot — as long as it's a serious suggestion, of course.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911101 thoma 18.ogg Thoma: I'll be waiting for you right here. Just come and find me if you need anything.
