 A giant dragon once helped me practice flying.
Asakura: You... you flew with a giant dragon? That's unimaginable...
 A great wolf aids me in practicing my martial arts.
Asakura: That sounds truly brave. I really wish I could see you and the great wolf fighting against each other...
 Haven't you already taken your weapon back?
Asakura: I did retrieve my weapon, yes, but that doesn't mean that my training is over.
Asakura: I had a run-in with the Kairagi before. It would be presumptuous to say that I will not run into even stronger enemies in the future.
Asakura: I shall never let my weapon fall into the hands of the enemy again, thus allowing my honor as a samurai be desecrated. That's the way of samurai I wish to pursue.
 I still need a moment.
Asakura: Mm. Please, take your time, and let me know when you are ready.
 I'll hold back next time...
 I'm here to spar again.
 It's... nothing special.
 Okay, let's start.
Asakura: No problem. Do watch yourself.
(Starts the match)
 Quest DescriptionAsakura, who was able to reclaim his weapon, is still looking for someone to help him practice his martial arts...
 Your skill with a lance has improved a lot.
Asakura: Haha... You jest too much.
Asakura: From what I have heard, one of the reasons why the lance was invented was that it allows someone who doesn't really know how to wield a weapon such as myself to fight with ease.
Asakura: After all, this type of weapon is long and sharp. Even if the wielder doesn't know how to use it, simply stabbing and swinging with it at least appears strong.
Asakura: However, by this rule... I actually think the humble garden fork with its three sharp tips has greater power...
Asakura: *panting* Your skills are truly far above mine...
Asakura: *sigh* Well, that's all for chit-chat. I don't believe that I should be wasting your time.
Asakura: After all, this type of weapon is long and sharp. Even if the wielder doesn't know how to use it, simply stabbing and swinging with it at least appears strong.
Asakura: Forgive me for being blunt, but I am really curious about how you have trained yourself.
Asakura: From what I have heard, one of the reasons why the lance was invented was that it allows someone who doesn't really know how to wield a weapon such as myself to fight with ease.
Asakura: Given your great strength, you must have gone through much training...
Asakura: Haha... You jest too much.
Asakura: Hahaha, is that so? Then I guess you must be really gifted then.
Asakura: However, by this rule... I actually think the humble garden fork with its three sharp tips has greater power...
Asakura: I did retrieve my weapon, yes, but that doesn't mean that my training is over.
Asakura: I had a run-in with the Kairagi before. It would be presumptuous to say that I will not run into even stronger enemies in the future.
Asakura: I shall never let my weapon fall into the hands of the enemy again, thus allowing my honor as a samurai be desecrated. That's the way of samurai I wish to pursue.
Asakura: It's truly great to have someone as formidable as you to practice with me.
Asakura: Mm. Please, take your time, and let me know when you are ready.
Asakura: No problem. Do watch yourself.
Asakura: No! Please use all of your strength. Without practice, I won't grow further.
Asakura: Oh! It's you. Did you take my commission again? Much obliged!
Asakura: Please don't hold back, give me all you have.
Asakura: Straight lance, straight line... Hah!
Asakura: Thank you for sparring with me. I will remember what you have taught me. Please take these as compensation.
Asakura: That sounds truly brave. I really wish I could see you and the great wolf fighting against each other...
Asakura: You... you flew with a giant dragon? That's unimaginable...
