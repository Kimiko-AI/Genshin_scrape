 Quest DescriptionThoma would like to do something for you to thank you for your help during the Vision Hunt Decree...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: I keep thinking, since I'm the host here, we ought to do something you'll enjoy.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: But despite that, I still haven't got a clear plan on where to take you.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: What do you usually prefer — indoor or outdoor activities?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Sounds like a plan. I don't really feel like spending my day running all over the place, either.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: In which case, let's head to Komore Teahouse.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: There's nowhere better to sit and chat quietly with a pot of tea.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: I'll head over there now to get a few things prepared. Come and join me when you're ready.
(Proceed to Thanks for Your Hospitality!)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: You want to go out for a stroll? Perfect, I have a couple of places I was going to recommend.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: If you like cats and dogs, there's a great place I can take you.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: I go there pretty much every time I have a day off. You can't help but be in a good mood when you're surrounded by cute animals.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Failing that, we could go downtown if you'd prefer?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: Narukami Island will be packed right now, so we could go to Ritou instead.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: Hehe, back to where we first met. I haven't been there in a long time, actually.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: Which one are you feeling? It's up to you.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: Haha, I had a feeling you'd pick that one, nice to know we share the same interests.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: There's a sakura tree in Hanamizaka where I go to feed them. Let's meet there in a short while.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 17.ogg Thoma: I need to go grab a few things — can't go there empty-handed...
(Proceed to Under the Same Shade)
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 18.ogg Thoma: Okay! Let's go straight there.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 19.ogg Thoma: I know Ritou pretty well, so I'll give you the grand tour.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911201 thoma 20.ogg Thoma: Today's a rare day off, so above all, let's enjoy ourselves!
