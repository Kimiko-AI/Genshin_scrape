 Quest DescriptionAfter experiencing the Akitsu Yuugei, a mysterious doorway suddenly appeared nearby...
Paimon: Paimon doesn't remember seeing that before. When did that show up?
Paimon: Paimon wonders what it's like inside. Let's go in and take a look!
Paimon: That was pretty fun... Huh? What's that?
Paimon: This looks like part of Akitsu Yuugei too... Should we go take a closer look? Paimon will let you decide.
Paimon: This should be the place.
