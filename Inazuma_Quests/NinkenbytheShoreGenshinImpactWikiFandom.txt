 "Inu Shoushou"?
 But it's from the Shuumatsuban...
 But that means...
 He seems to be more affectionate this time.
 Inu Shoushou will be waiting forever...
 Inu Shoushou...
 Is that its name?
 It still doesn't want to cooperate.
 It's a deal alright.
 Looks like we failed...
 Quest DescriptionYou find the masterless ninken that Thoma mentioned, but its attitude is a bit...
 Thoma...
 Those monsters, perhaps?
 You're really putting yourself out there...

Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 inushoushou 01.ogg Ninken: Woof! Woof! *growl*
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 inushoushou 02.ogg Ninken: Woof! Woof, woof!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Oh... see it? It's that one, just up ahead.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Judging by the breed and apparel, it definitely is a ninja dog from the Shuumatsuban.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: It's looking a little more docile today. Shall we try and get closer?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Oh, uh, you should stay a few paces behind me. I know it looks calm, but if it gets riled up, it could pounce and bite in an instant.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Here doggy, good doggy... you hungry my friend? I brought you a nice little snack...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: You're a vicious little thing, aren't you? You almost bit me again!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: Look at you, wasting away... you must wanna eat a little something?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: You don't have to come back with us, but c'mon — a dog's gotta eat, right?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: You're not worried it's poisoned, are you? Here, I'll take the first bite.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: See? Delicious and poison-free.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Come on, just have a bite. A little tiny bite, and then I'll leave you alone, how's that sound?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: Looks like it has zero intention of eating the food we brought... Is it just me, or does it look kind of on edge?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: Maybe it's something in the sea... Or something nearby that's got him on alert.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: You think he was attacked by monsters... Hmm, it's possible.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: People do tend to lose their appetite in dangerous situations. Maybe it's the same for dogs, too. Let's clear out the area on behalf of our canine companion here.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911701 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: Thanks for helping out. This place should be a little more tranquil now, (Traveler).
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 inushoushou 01.ogg Ninken: Woof! Woof! *growl*
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 inushoushou 02.ogg Ninken: Woof! Woof, woof, woof!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Here doggy, look — no more danger.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: You've gotta wanna eat a little something now? Come on, eat up, then let's get you back to Komore Teahouse.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Whatever's on your mind, you can tell me and Taroumaru all about it.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: *sigh* Rejected again.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: And there I was thinking that I was the one it didn't like. I didn't expect it to be so on edge around you, too.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Well, to me, this proves that it simply doesn't want to leave this place. For now, let's not force it.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: Time to head back to the Yashiro Commission headquarters. I'll see if I can find its owner, so they can come and collect it.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: That's right — the Shuumatsuban only answer to the Yashiro Commissioner, Kamisato Ayato. Under most circumstances, no one else has the authority to inquire into their business.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: However, I was talking to Commissioner Ayato a while back, and he agreed to let me bend the rules in exceptional circumstances.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: That doesn't mean I can mobilize the Shuumatsuban to do my bidding, of course. But I'll be able to get the intel we need, no problem. It's sort of a prerogative I have.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Alright, there's a good dog, calm down. We're not gonna take you away.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: It's much safer here now, see? We're gonna leave now, make sure to give yourself a good rest.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911702 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: Alright, let's go, (Traveler).
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 01.ogg Kazuaki: This ninja dog you speak of... it rings a bell.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 02.ogg Kazuaki: Could I trouble you to describe it again for me?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 03.ogg Kazuaki: Ah, I think I know. You must be talking about Inu Shoushou.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 04.ogg Kazuaki: That's right. I'm really surprised that's where you found him...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 05.ogg Kazuaki: I'm sorry. That won't be possible.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 06.ogg Kazuaki: I'm afraid I can't disclose the owner's identity.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 07.ogg Kazuaki: What I can tell you is they went out to sea on a dangerous mission, and... he won't be coming back.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 08.ogg Kazuaki: I had no idea that he hadn't taken Inu Shoushou along with him. Seems he decided to face this one alone.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 09.ogg Kazuaki: I can only assume that Inu Shoushou is waiting for his owner to come back, which is why he refuses to move from the beach...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 10.ogg Kazuaki: Most of his possessions disappeared along with the man himself. The only thing I can think of is the Kunai he used to train with.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 11.ogg Kazuaki: Come with me. I'll see if I can find it for you.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 12.ogg Kazuaki: Ah, yes, this looks like the one.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 13.ogg Kazuaki: The reason this Kunai stands out in my memory is because when he first joined the Shuumatsuban, he trained at it harder than anyone else, to the point where the tip became blunt from erosion.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 kazuaki 14.ogg Kazuaki: Take it. The Shuumatsuban will make sure to cover Inu Shoushou's daily expenses.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: A red Shiba, with a scar on its eye, dressed in black stealth wear...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Perfect! Now that we've figured out his identity, we can get its owner to go and collect it.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: I should add, it's never good to have dogs run away like this. The poor thing's out there all on his own with no real food or shelter, day and night.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: So, shall we go find the owner and see if they have time to fetch him?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Why?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Did Inu Shoushou's owner leave anything behind?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: You know, any personal items, or a Shuumatsuban uniform perhaps?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Thank you kindly. Let's just hope Inu Shoushou remembers the scent of this Kunai... Then again, I'm certain he will.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911703 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: Let's go pay Inu Shoushou another visit, (Traveler).
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 inushoushou 01.ogg Inu Shoushou: Woof! ...Woof?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 inushoushou 02.ogg Inu Shoushou: Woof, woof! Woof!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 inushoushou 03.ogg Inu Shoushou: Woof...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Hey, Inu Shoushou...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: I know, I know, how come this strange man suddenly knows your name?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: You're waiting for your master to come home, aren't you? Mind if we wait with you?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Don't worry, we're not looking to suddenly whisk you away. Look at this, do you know what it is?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: As I thought. You remember.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Excellent. It looks like what he needed wasn't for us to take him away, but for us to accompany him.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: You know, I sometimes did this too, when I first arrived in Inazuma. I just stood on the beach, looking out at the horizon.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Everyone has people and events from their past that they look back on fondly. I guess we only grow when we realize that those things aren't coming back.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: The Shuumatsuban is not a peaceful organization, and being a ninja is an extremely dangerous profession.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: Many of the Shuumatsuban's ninjas have paid the ultimate price in the course of carrying out top-secret missions. The Shuumatsuban never discloses their identities, and doesn't publicly commemorate them.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: But at least now, Inu Shoushou, you're not the only one in the world who remembers him.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: From today onward, we will join you in honoring his memory.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: I think that means "deal," right, (Traveler)?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: Hey, in the future, let's try and come back here from time to time, when we get the chance.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: Maybe we could build a little kennel for him. In the long-term, being out in the cold and wet like this could start to cause joint problems.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911704 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: I could make some winter clothes for him, too. In fact, I'd better get started...
Ninken: Woof! Woof! *growl*
