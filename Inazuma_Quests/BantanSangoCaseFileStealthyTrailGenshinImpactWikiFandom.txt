 "Hat Blade Pup."
Ryuuji: That combination doesn't work.
Paimon: What sort of nickname is that, anyway!?
 Any details?
Paimon: Yup yup yup! This sounds super interesting — c'mon, let's hear some more!
Ryuuji: I didn't know that you were so interested in our work.
Ryuuji: In truth, we had already locked onto our suspect. The trouble was that we could not find any incriminating evidence at his place, nor could we find any other clues.
Ryuuji: Later, I heard, entirely by chance, that our suspect had sold some Naku Weed the day before. I went to the buyer to inspect the product and discovered it was indeed still fresh.
Ryuuji: After hearing this, Sango bade me go to the foothills of Mt. Yougou to investigate.
Paimon: Eh? Why Mt. Yougou?
Ryuuji: "Our suspect lives on Narukami Island. Although Naku Weed can be found all over Inazuma, most people need a boat to get to the other islands, and we found no boat."
Ryuuji: "Additionally, the Tenryou Commission is very touchy about the use of boats due to the Sakoku Decree. If our suspect was planning to commit a crime, they would not have done it such that they would be exposed to the Commission."
Ryuuji: "That thus eliminates the other islands." That was what she said.
Paimon: But there's Naku Weed around the Grand Narukami Shrine, isn't there? Why did you only check the foothills of Mt. Yougou?
Ryuuji: Sango considered this too. "Naku Weed grows around the Grand Narukami Shrine, yes, but the shrine maidens are there, and many worshippers frequent the area."
Ryuuji: "If anything out of the ordinary were to happen there, it would be liable to be found out."
Paimon: Ooh, so that's how it is! Paimon can see why Sango's the brains of the party now!
Ryuuji: As it turned out, we did find a pile of soil in the foothills that showed signs of having been loosened recently. Our suspect had buried the stolen objects there and had been intending to wait out the heat before emerging and fencing these goods.
Ryuuji: But he thought that he might attract suspicion by leaving heavy-laden and returning empty-handed, so he collected Naku Weed along the way and made to sell them.
Paimon: Hah, but it was also the Naku Weed that got him caught!
Ryuuji: Indeed. As such, I believe that there are leads nearby. We just haven't thought to uncover them yet.
 C'mon, less fighting...
 Can we count on this intel?
 Found any leads?
 Let's hope it goes well this time, too.
Paimon: Yup! The people who lost their pets must be in a real panic right now...
 No thanks.
 Quest DescriptionRyuuji seems to have gotten some new leads and needs to investigate further...
 Thanks, but no thanks.
 That was a very Paimonial nickname...
Paimon: (Traveler), be careful!
Paimon: Ah, that's the one from yesterday...
Paimon: But there's Naku Weed around the Grand Narukami Shrine, isn't there? Why did you only check the foothills of Mt. Yougou?
Paimon: Eh? Why Mt. Yougou?
Paimon: Hah, but it was also the Naku Weed that got him caught!
Paimon: Hey now! Paimon wouldn't come up with such lame nicknames! If it were up to Paimon...
Paimon: Hey! Don't ignore Paimon!
Paimon: It's "Blade Pup"!
Paimon: It's these incorrigible guys again!
Paimon: Let's teach them a lesson, (Traveler)!
Paimon: Ooh, so that's how it is! Paimon can see why Sango's the brains of the party now!
Paimon: That many animals went missing, huh?
Paimon: This dog would be called "Blade Pup!"
Paimon: We've gone to all the places that Ryuuji marked out. Let's head back to the Bantan Sango Detective Agency and look for him there!
Paimon: Well, that should be the little animals now. Hmph! These baddies had better spend some time thinking about what they've done!
Paimon: What sort of nickname is that, anyway!?
Paimon: Why aren't you coming with us this time, Ryuuji?
Paimon: Woohoo! That should be all the animals in this area.
Paimon: Yup yup yup! This sounds super interesting — c'mon, let's hear some more!
Paimon: Yup! The people who lost their pets must be in a real panic right now...
Ryuuji marks the map...
Ryuuji: "Additionally, the Tenryou Commission is very touchy about the use of boats due to the Sakoku Decree. If our suspect was planning to commit a crime, they would not have done it such that they would be exposed to the Commission."
Ryuuji: "Hat Dog."
Ryuuji: "If anything out of the ordinary were to happen there, it would be liable to be found out."
Ryuuji: "Our suspect lives on Narukami Island. Although Naku Weed can be found all over Inazuma, most people need a boat to get to the other islands, and we found no boat."
Ryuuji: "That thus eliminates the other islands." That was what she said.
Ryuuji: ...
Ryuuji: After hearing this, Sango bade me go to the foothills of Mt. Yougou to investigate.
Ryuuji: Ah. That's a shame.
Ryuuji: Any other questions?
Ryuuji: As it turned out, we did find a pile of soil in the foothills that showed signs of having been loosened recently. Our suspect had buried the stolen objects there and had been intending to wait out the heat before emerging and fencing these goods.
Ryuuji: At the moment, it appears that one of the camps is guarded by our "Hat Dog." This location requires greater care.
Ryuuji: Broadly, she has some ideas as to the source of our "Hat Dog," and has asked that I investigate the matter.
Ryuuji: But he thought that he might attract suspicion by leaving heavy-laden and returning empty-handed, so he collected Naku Weed along the way and made to sell them.
Ryuuji: Hmm. Perhaps we should just return to calling it "Black Shadow."
Ryuuji: I believe that our present cooperation is quite ideal. After all, my true specialty is running errands, not stealth or combat. Leaving this part to you, in fact, suits me more than just fine.
Ryuuji: I didn't know that you were so interested in our work.
Ryuuji: I have placed similar devices around that location. Hopefully, they'll have the same effect as before.
Ryuuji: I will continue my investigations. If you have other things you need to work on, please do them first.
Ryuuji: I would have, if not for a certain other task that I must perform for Sango.
Ryuuji: I'll leave the rest in your hands.
Ryuuji: In truth, we had already locked onto our suspect. The trouble was that we could not find any incriminating evidence at his place, nor could we find any other clues.
Ryuuji: Indeed. As such, I believe that there are leads nearby. We just haven't thought to uncover them yet.
Ryuuji: Later, I heard, entirely by chance, that our suspect had sold some Naku Weed the day before. I went to the buyer to inspect the product and discovered it was indeed still fresh.
Ryuuji: Most certainly. I did scout the areas out myself.
Ryuuji: Our trail ran cold, and if not for Sango's deductions, we would have lost it altogether.
Ryuuji: Sango considered this too. "Naku Weed grows around the Grand Narukami Shrine, yes, but the shrine maidens are there, and many worshippers frequent the area."
Ryuuji: Sango might seem a little... complicated to speak to, and she says strange things like "conscience holds wisdom back," but she is a gentle person at heart.
Ryuuji: Thank you very much. Hmm... These still aren't all of them...
Ryuuji: That combination doesn't work.
Ryuuji: Unfortunately so, yes. Comparing these to the commissions we received, we should have found around half the missing animals.
Ryuuji: Unfortunately, we're out of leads again. Fortunately, live animals are far easier to investigate than inanimate objects, in any case.
Ryuuji: We did receive just such a request from an important family recently.
Ryuuji: We have largely confirmed a few locations with the aid of her deductions.
Ryuuji: We will meet again, when the time comes, at the agency. Thanks once again for your efforts.
Ryuuji: Well, now that I think about it, this is for the best. If Sango had someone like you, I'd be out of a job.
Ryuuji: What do you think? Do you have any interest in working at Bantan Sango?
Ryuuji: Whatever the case, I leave the animals to you.
Ryuuji: Yes, thanks to Sango.
Ryuuji: You're here.
Sango: I've got an... interesting hunch about Black Shadow's origins that I'd like him to check out.
Sango: Ryuuji's informed you of the exact locations, has he? Go, then. This time, the two of you should split up.
You recount the events to Ryuuji...
