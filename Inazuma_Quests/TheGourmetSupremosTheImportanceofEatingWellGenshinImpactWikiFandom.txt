 A sensitive lot, huh.
Kamei Munehisa: It's not surprising, considering their position.
Kamei Munehisa: I think they were just using any excuse to deal with a "disobedient" person like me. To throw their weight around a bit.
Kamei Munehisa: After all, I have repeatedly refused them. It must have come as a blow.
 An unreasonable bunch...
Kamei Munehisa: They've never acted reasonably. But in their situation... there really isn't any reasoning to be done.
 Are all the Kairagi...
Kamei Munehisa: Not all. But regardless, they were all cowards who raise their swords against the weak.
 Goodbye.
Parvaneh: Okay, goodbye.
 Have you really been just wandering around?
Kamei Munehisa: Indeed. I would never lie. Since I left the Shogunate, I've been just wandering around.
Kamei Munehisa: I usually fill my stomach with wild fruits and, when I'm lucky, fresh game.
Kamei Munehisa: Occasionally, I also help people to fight off monsters or Kairagi, which gets me at least some payment.
Kamei Munehisa: Hehe... For someone like me who has no skills other than wielding a sword, job opportunities are a bit scarce.
Kamei Munehisa: Not to mention my background of leaving the Shogunate. People always associate me with the Kairagi, and that makes it even harder to find work.
Kamei Munehisa: I have no home or family to go to in Inazuma. Since I had nowhere to go, I just wandered.
 I came to help.
Xudong: Really? Thank you so much! Now, Julie seems to have gone deeper within...
Xudong: There are tons of monsters there. It's hard to deal with them with just the two of us. But we should be much better off with your help.
 I can help, too.
 I'll go with you.
Parvaneh: That would be great.
 I'm here for the big feast you promised.
Xudong: No problem. But I can't cook it alone.
Xudong: Traveler, could you do me a favor and help us get Julie back first?
Xudong: Julie seems to have gone deeper in... and there are tons of monsters there. It will hard going with just the two of us.
Xudong: After we find Julie, I'll make you the feast I promised.
 If she runs into a monster...
Parvaneh: If Julie runs into a monster... Honestly, I'd be more worried for the monster.
Parvaneh: But if she runs into the Kairagi or something like that, that would be bad. Kairagi can't be dealt with in the same way as monsters...
Parvaneh: Even if Xudong and I joined forces, it would still be...
 I can help, too.
Parvaneh: Huh? You're willing to help? That would be great.
 Is that how they make a living?
Kamei Munehisa: ...Yes. We don't have any way to make money other than by the sword.
 Let's do this.
 No, I haven't...
 No, it's a noble ideal.
 Parvaneh's handling herself just fine, too.
Parvaneh: Huh? Well... hahaha, I just threw a few books at the monster's heads. You were the one who fought them off.
Parvaneh: Wait. Where is "Along with Divinity Volume 6"? Did I throw it, too? I haven't finished that one yet!
 Quest DescriptionSomething seems to have Parvaneh of the Gourmet Supremos all in a fluster...
 See you around.
Julie: Bye. I'll never miss breakfast again...
 See you later.
Kamei Munehisa: Farewell.
 See you later.
Xudong: You're leaving? Not having any seconds?
 Sort of, yes...
 Such simple and straightforward logic...
 That's why breakfast is so important.
 The samurai?
 Well, guess you won't be skipping breakfast from now on.
 What happened?
 What made you trust him?
Julie: That's... an adventurer's intuition. I'm very good at telling the good guys from the bad guys.
Julie: Only good people give out food when they're hungry...
 Where can I buy a wok like yours?
Xudong: Haha, great question. I had it specially cast at Hanfeng's Ironmongers.
Xudong: It's said to have materials excavated from the Chasm added to the iron. If you want to get one, go to Hanfeng's Ironmongers.
Xudong: But I heard that the Chasm has been locked down for a long time. I doubt he would be able to make any now...
 Why did you agree to join Xudong?
Kamei Munehisa: Like Xudong said, if I want to have enough to eat... working for him is my best option at the moment.
Kamei Munehisa: Besides, Julie and Xudong are both of high moral character, and it will be an honor to travel with them.
Kamei Munehisa: Parvaneh... is a thoughtful person. It is understandable she would be wary of me.
Kamei Munehisa: Besides, she is merely a little suspicious of me as opposed to rejecting me outright, and that... that is enough for me.
 Why did you help him?
Xudong: Do you mean Uncle Munehisa? I did it out of my professional ethics as a chef, of course.
Xudong: Hah, just kidding. But I really don't want to see a good man like him go hungry.
Xudong: In truth... I don't want to see anyone go hungry.
Xudong: Hunger is a terrible feeling. I've had first-hand experience.
Xudong: People can do terrible things under the influence of hunger.
Xudong: I think that if everyone in this world ate well, perhaps, a lot of terrible things could be avoided.
Xudong: I can't do it alone, true, but as a chef, I can at least try to help the people around me eat well.
Xudong: Hahaha, to put it simply, I just want everyone to have food and eat well. A rather meaningless ideal, I suppose.
 No, it's a noble ideal.
Xudong: Hehe, thanks a lot. Okay... no more talking. Have some more and don't leave any on your plate. Wasting food is a terrible sin.
 Why did you leave the Shogunate?
Kamei Munehisa: I just... couldn't agree with what the Shogunate was doing in Inazuma.
Kamei Munehisa: I'm just a martial artist. I don't know what's good for the country or not.
Kamei Munehisa: I only knew that it went against what was in my heart, so I chose to leave.
Kamei Munehisa: Hehe. Perhaps I was just too old-fashioned... Please try not to laugh.
 Why did you want to bring him food?
Julie: Well... I just didn't want to see him go hungry.
Julie: The last time I saw him, he seemed sad. I thought it was probably because he didn't have enough to eat.
Julie: So I wanted to bring some food to him. He won't be so sad once he's full, I thought.
 Xudong has quite a bit of swagger.
Xudong: Of course! A chef has to carry himself in a certain way.
Parvaneh: I've never heard of such a thing! Why would a chef learn to smash monsters with an iron pot?!
 You should have been able to deal with them, right?
 You still don't seem to trust him, huh?
Parvaneh: You mean Kamei Munehisa? Of course not... we've only met him a few times, how could I trust him so quickly?
Parvaneh: ...But while I don't trust Kamei Munehisa, I do trust Xudong's judgment.
 You're from the Akademiya?
Parvaneh: Sort of. I was originally doing field research for the Akademiya when I met Xudong in Liyue.
Parvaneh: He was planning to travel around and study recipes, and the topic I was studying happened to be related to food. After we talked a few times, we decided to travel together.
Parvaneh: We first went to Mondstadt where we were surrounded by a bunch of monsters. That's when Julie came, and she helped us chase them away.
Parvaneh: When she heard that we were traveling around looking for different cuisine, she joined us.
Parvaneh: She said she was planning to go adventuring, but I have the feeling that she just wanted to have some good food...
Parvaneh: We'll be going to Sumeru next. I'm almost done with my research, so it's time for me to go back to Akademiya.
Parvaneh: When we get to Sumeru, I'll make sure they get a taste of our local specialties...
 You're going to fight the Kairagi?
Xudong: Definitely. My wok's raring to go, see?
Xudong: Besides, chefs can't run away on the eve of battle.
Parvaneh: I told you not to have such high standards for chefs or their iron woks!
Julie: Anyone who is willing to share food with others when they are hungry must be a good person!
Julie: Bye. I'll never miss breakfast again...
Julie: Hehe. This is actually quite tasty. I'll definitely go for another round...
Julie: I did see him there, as it turned out.
Julie: I lost all the Chicken-Mushroom Skewers on me when I was spotted by those Kairagi... Luckily I had Uncle Munehisa to protect me.
Julie: I wanted to get away, but I was spotted by them...
Julie: I was just about to say hello when I noticed that he was confronting some Kairagi.
Julie: I'm sure he's a good man! He was starving, but he gave the food to us instead of keeping it for himself.
Julie: It's simple... I just wanted to bring him some food.
Julie: I—I'll tell you later... Let's go help him! He's all alone...
Julie: Only good people give out food when they're hungry...
Julie: So I made some Chicken-Mushroom Skewers and wanted to try my luck finding him where we first met.
Julie: So I wanted to bring some food to him. He won't be so sad once he's full, I thought.
Julie: So he went to deal with those guys and I stayed where I was, waiting for him to return. Then suddenly, a group of monsters appeared...
Julie: That's Uncle Munehisa! Save him, quick!
Julie: That's... an adventurer's intuition. I'm very good at telling the good guys from the bad guys.
Julie: The last time I saw him, he seemed sad. I thought it was probably because he didn't have enough to eat.
Julie: Uncle Munehisa, are you okay?...
Julie: Usually, I could. But I didn't eat anything when I left this morning, so I was too hungry. I didn't have any energy.
Julie: Well... I just didn't want to see him go hungry.
Julie: Woohoo!
Julie: W—Wait! We have to help Uncle Munehisa! He's fighting against Kairagi in the woods, all alone.
Julie: Yay, that would be great!
Kairagi: But this is the end of the line!
Kairagi: Gah! This mangy dog is hard to handle...
Kairagi: Hahaha, you actually came at me with your wok! Do you have a...
Kairagi: Huh? What... a book... again!? Who's throwing books!?
Kairagi: I can't believe he's beaten so many of us by himself...
Kamei Munehisa: ...
Kamei Munehisa: ...Yes. We don't have any way to make money other than by the sword.
Kamei Munehisa: After Inazuma's sudden change, we all left the Shogunate one after another to make our own living.
Kamei Munehisa: After all, I have repeatedly refused them. It must have come as a blow.
Kamei Munehisa: Ahem... Sorry that you have to see me like this.
Kamei Munehisa: Among those... people, are some of my old friends who served with me under the Shogunate.
Kamei Munehisa: Besides, Julie and Xudong are both of high moral character, and it will be an honor to travel with them.
Kamei Munehisa: Besides, she is merely a little suspicious of me as opposed to rejecting me outright, and that... that is enough for me.
Kamei Munehisa: But no one would dare hire me as soon as they found out that I used to be a samurai who had left the Shogunate.
Kamei Munehisa: Farewell.
Kamei Munehisa: Hehe. Perhaps I was just too old-fashioned... Please try not to laugh.
Kamei Munehisa: Hehe... For someone like me who has no skills other than wielding a sword, job opportunities are a bit scarce.
Kamei Munehisa: I didn't want to live like that, so I've wandered the land looking for work.
Kamei Munehisa: I have no home or family to go to in Inazuma. Since I had nowhere to go, I just wandered.
Kamei Munehisa: I just... couldn't agree with what the Shogunate was doing in Inazuma.
Kamei Munehisa: I only knew that it went against what was in my heart, so I chose to leave.
Kamei Munehisa: I think they were just using any excuse to deal with a "disobedient" person like me. To throw their weight around a bit.
Kamei Munehisa: I usually fill my stomach with wild fruits and, when I'm lucky, fresh game.
Kamei Munehisa: I'll take it from here...
Kamei Munehisa: I'm just a martial artist. I don't know what's good for the country or not.
Kamei Munehisa: In that case, I am at your service, sir.
Kamei Munehisa: Indeed. I would never lie. Since I left the Shogunate, I've been just wandering around.
Kamei Munehisa: It's not surprising, considering their position.
Kamei Munehisa: Just a few lost go-arounds. No big deal.
Kamei Munehisa: Like Xudong said, if I want to have enough to eat... working for him is my best option at the moment.
Kamei Munehisa: Not all. But regardless, they were all cowards who raise their swords against the weak.
Kamei Munehisa: Not to mention my background of leaving the Shogunate. People always associate me with the Kairagi, and that makes it even harder to find work.
Kamei Munehisa: Occasionally, I also help people to fight off monsters or Kairagi, which gets me at least some payment.
Kamei Munehisa: Parvaneh... is a thoughtful person. It is understandable she would be wary of me.
Kamei Munehisa: Recently, my former comrades seem to be short-handed, so they have come every day to persuade me to join them. I refused every time.
Kamei Munehisa: Since then, as you can see, I've had to scavenge for food in the wilderness.
Kamei Munehisa: Since then, they became the Kairagi as you see them, making a living by plundering.
Kamei Munehisa: Sir, you...
Kamei Munehisa: That's true. If I go with you, I might get you into trouble.
Kamei Munehisa: They've never acted reasonably. But in their situation... there really isn't any reasoning to be done.
Kamei Munehisa: Today... when Julie appeared, they thought that I must've joined some Clan or another and was trying to get rid of them. So they attacked us.
Kamei Munehisa: What is the matter?
Paimon: Huh. Someone's being attacked by monsters over there...
Paimon: It looks like everyone is full of energy... Let's join in!
Paimon: Wait up!... Come on, Traveler, let's get in there too!
Parvaneh: *sigh* Xudong and I split up. He went to find the place where we met Kamei Munehisa the previous time. I came to the Adventurers' Guild to post a missing person commission.
Parvaneh: *sigh*... You only met him once. Why... do you trust him so much?
Parvaneh: ...But while I don't trust Kamei Munehisa, I do trust Xudong's judgment.
Parvaneh: But if she runs into the Kairagi or something like that, that would be bad. Kairagi can't be dealt with in the same way as monsters...
Parvaneh: But since he's a samurai who left the Shogunate, wouldn't he get us into trouble in Inazuma?
Parvaneh: Even if Xudong and I joined forces, it would still be...
Parvaneh: Ever since we got back, Julie has been talking about sending him food to show our appreciation...
Parvaneh: He was planning to travel around and study recipes, and the topic I was studying happened to be related to food. After we talked a few times, we decided to travel together.
Parvaneh: Hey! Don't use the pot, dummy!
Parvaneh: Hey! If you break the wok, what will we cook with!?
Parvaneh: Huh? Well... hahaha, I just threw a few books at the monster's heads. You were the one who fought them off.
Parvaneh: Huh? You're willing to help? That would be great.
Parvaneh: I can't believe that she actually dared to run off with how things are in Inazuma right now... We must find her, and quickly!
Parvaneh: I can't believe those two...
Parvaneh: I told you not to have such high standards for chefs or their iron woks!
Parvaneh: I've never heard of such a thing! Why would a chef learn to smash monsters with an iron pot?!
Parvaneh: If Julie runs into a monster... Honestly, I'd be more worried for the monster.
Parvaneh: Julie suddenly disappeared. No, well... maybe it's not accurate to say that she "suddenly" disappeared.
Parvaneh: Kairagi? Not monsters? How did you get involved with them?
Parvaneh: K—Knock them out? What do you want me to do, hit them with my books?
Parvaneh: Okay, goodbye.
Parvaneh: She said she was planning to go adventuring, but I have the feeling that she just wanted to have some good food...
Parvaneh: Sort of. I was originally doing field research for the Akademiya when I met Xudong in Liyue.
Parvaneh: Tell me everything please, or my books were wrecked for nothing... Agh, the pages are all wrinkled now...
Parvaneh: That would be great.
Parvaneh: That's...
Parvaneh: The idiot... She doesn't know what she's doing! That Kamei Munehisa looked so suspicious!
Parvaneh: There are still many of these unreasonable Kairagi in Inazuma. We're going to be here for a while, and it just doesn't feel safe...
Parvaneh: This is a good thing, right? Yeah, this is for the best...
Parvaneh: This is the power of knowledge! The weight of Sumeru Akademiya's wisdom!
Parvaneh: Traveler... you're just in time! Have you seen Julie? The... the short Mondstadt girl who was with me!?
Parvaneh: Ugh, whatever! These books should be thick enough... Now get away from Julie!
Parvaneh: Wait. Where is "Along with Divinity Volume 6"? Did I throw it, too? I haven't finished that one yet!
Parvaneh: We can deal with a few weak monsters, but there's no way we can handle a group of people who know martial arts...
Parvaneh: We first went to Mondstadt where we were surrounded by a bunch of monsters. That's when Julie came, and she helped us chase them away.
Parvaneh: We met an old man named Kamei Munehisa when you last came with us to collect ingredients. Do you remember him?
Parvaneh: We'll be going to Sumeru next. I'm almost done with my research, so it's time for me to go back to Akademiya.
Parvaneh: When she heard that we were traveling around looking for different cuisine, she joined us.
Parvaneh: When we get to Sumeru, I'll make sure they get a taste of our local specialties...
Parvaneh: Xudong and I have agreed on a rendezvous point, so we'll meet him there first.
Parvaneh: Xudong and I thought she was just saying it. However, she left a note in the camp today and actually went looking for him.
Parvaneh: Yeah. He defeated the monsters near the camp and gave us ingredients from around those parts.
Parvaneh: You mean Kamei Munehisa? Of course not... we've only met him a few times, how could I trust him so quickly?
Parvaneh: You must live in some fairy tale world instead of Teyvat.
Parvaneh: You're expecting too much out of it...
Parvaneh: You... you no-good nitwitted numbskulls! Behold!
Parvaneh: Your concept of good and evil is so straightforward and pure...
Parvaneh: You— You haven't seen her either? Where on earth did that idiot go...
Under Xudong's guiding hand, the grand feast comes together...
Xudong: After we find Julie, I'll make you the feast I promised.
Xudong: Ah, full at last... Hmm...
Xudong: All right! I'm sure everyone is starving after all that work. This isn't a great place to cook... but I'll find a way to whip something up...
Xudong: Alright then. Enough talk. Let's eat!
Xudong: Alright, I got it. Traveler, could you come with us?
Xudong: Anyway, Julie, do continue.
Xudong: Besides, chefs can't run away on the eve of battle.
Xudong: Besides, it's just a few monsters. What kind of iron wok would it be if it couldn't knock them flat?
Xudong: But I heard that the Chasm has been locked down for a long time. I doubt he would be able to make any now...
Xudong: Come on, let's go!
Xudong: Definitely. My wok's raring to go, see?
Xudong: Do you mean Uncle Munehisa? I did it out of my professional ethics as a chef, of course.
Xudong: Don't underestimate Liyue's skill in making woks. This is a unique cast iron wok specially designed for tossing. It won't break easily.
Xudong: Done... haha. Onigiri made of leftover rice. It's a bit rough... but it will fill your stomach. Come on, let's eat.
Xudong: Hah, just kidding. But I really don't want to see a good man like him go hungry.
Xudong: Haha, great question. I had it specially cast at Hanfeng's Ironmongers.
Xudong: Hahaha, I don't think it matters. We're just going around looking for cooking ingredients.
Xudong: Hahaha, I think she's right, though.
Xudong: Hahaha, to put it simply, I just want everyone to have food and eat well. A rather meaningless ideal, I suppose.
Xudong: He said it's a recipe he got while he was still working for the Shogunate. It's quite unique. You can give it a try if you're interested.
Xudong: Hehe, thanks a lot. Okay... no more talking. Have some more and don't leave any on your plate. Wasting food is a terrible sin.
Xudong: Hehe. Well, what do you think? Would you like to join us? We can't offer much pay, but there will be plenty of food.
Xudong: How would you like to come with us?
Xudong: Hunger is a terrible feeling. I've had first-hand experience.
Xudong: I agree. Those who can uphold their honor and decency when they are hungry can't be all that bad.
Xudong: I can't do it alone, true, but as a chef, I can at least try to help the people around me eat well.
Xudong: I doubt I can fix anything else as a chef, but I can at least make sure that you're well-fed.
Xudong: I think that if everyone in this world ate well, perhaps, a lot of terrible things could be avoided.
Xudong: If you work for someone as a guard or in a security detail, you're more likely to attract suspicion.
Xudong: In truth... I don't want to see anyone go hungry.
Xudong: It's said to have materials excavated from the Chasm added to the iron. If you want to get one, go to Hanfeng's Ironmongers.
Xudong: Julie seems to have gone deeper in... and there are tons of monsters there. It will hard going with just the two of us.
Xudong: Let's get going. Julie should be in the woods.
Xudong: No problem. But I can't cook it alone.
Xudong: Now, Julie, could you tell us the whole story, then?
Xudong: Of course! A chef has to carry himself in a certain way.
Xudong: Okay, time to get started!
Xudong: Okay. Julie, let's get out of here. And fast!...
Xudong: Parvaneh... and Traveler? What brings you here?
Xudong: People can do terrible things under the influence of hunger.
Xudong: Plus, I don't think it would be right to let a good man like you starve.
Xudong: Really? Thank you so much! Now, Julie seems to have gone deeper within...
Xudong: Stop right there!
Xudong: That's Julie! Don't just stand there, Parvaneh. Go knock those monsters out!
Xudong: The best thing a person in his situation can do is to stay far away from anything to do with the Shogunate or samurai.
Xudong: There are tons of monsters there. It's hard to deal with them with just the two of us. But we should be much better off with your help.
Xudong: Traveler, could you do me a favor and help us get Julie back first?
Xudong: Traveler, have a rest. I'll take care of it. You just wait here.
Xudong: Traveler, thank you for coming with us. This recipe is for you. Uncle Munehisa just gave it to me, and I made you a copy.
Xudong: Uh... Uncle, you just mentioned that you're looking for a job, right?
Xudong: You're leaving? Not having any seconds?
