Media:vo xhlq005 cs tadakatsu 01.ogg Tadakatsu: Comrades!
Media:vo xhlq005 cs tadakatsu 02.ogg Tadakatsu: Never trust the Kujou. Let's get them!
Media:vo xhlq005 cs samuraia 01.ogg Tenryou Samurai: Protect Madam Kujou!
(The Traveler steps in between the Sangonomiya and Tenryou soldiers to prevent a fight from breaking out)
Media:vo xhlq005 cs paimon 01.ogg Paimon: No. 16... No, wait, 67... Or is it 73...
Media:vo xhlq005 cs paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Argh! Which one is it!
(During the standoff, Kokomi notices that two Tenryou soldiers are nervous)
(Kujou Sara follows Kokomi's gaze and takes notice of the nervous Tenryou samurai)
(Kokomi confidently sits back down and the talks resume)
(The cutscene ends)
 How're your energy levels?
 I also want the peace talks to succeed.
 I'm here to witness the peace talks.
 Of course.
 Quest DescriptionYou hurry towards the site where the peace talks are to begin. What will the future of Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate look like?
 Step DescriptionHow long till one's dreams can be achieved? Kokomi reveals her true feelings to you for the first time in front of her secret base.
 Step DescriptionUnexpectedly, the reckless actions of the troops have somehow sped the peace process along instead. Upon your return to Watatsumi Island, Kokomi pronounces how they will be dealt with...
 You did an admirable job.
Kokomi and Sara begin their tit-for-tat peace talks...
Kokomi and Sara calmly complete the follow-up negotiations...
Media:vo xhlq005 1 kokomi 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: *yawn*... Well, the peace talks are upon us. How do you feel, (Traveler)? Prepared?
Media:vo xhlq005 1 kokomi 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Here, take this.
Media:vo xhlq005 1 kokomi 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: These are some directives I wrote last night. These negotiations are complex, to be sure, but I thought about it carefully and realized there are no more than 187 possible outcomes.
Media:vo xhlq005 1 kokomi 04.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I took the liberty of writing them all down. This way, you will be able to adapt with speed, no matter how the events play out.
Media:vo xhlq005 1 kokomi 05.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Glad to hear it. These peace talks are quite exceptional. It is a major step forward both for Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate.
Media:vo xhlq005 1 kokomi 06.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: But any amount of dissatisfaction within our ranks weakens our negotiating position. We will have to work all the harder if we want these talks to be a success.
Media:vo xhlq005 1 kokomi 07.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: As the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island, this responsibility is of course mine to shoulder. But would you be willing to lend me a hand?
Media:vo xhlq005 1 kokomi 08.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Excellent. Okay, time to head off.
Media:vo xhlq005 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa, this is huuuuge!
Media:vo xhlq005 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's see... "Fierce Dispute," "Violent Escalation," "Armed Revolt," "Coordinated Attack," "Seize Hostages"...
Media:vo xhlq005 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wow, there's so many! But you've thought of a solution to each one... Paimon suddenly feels a lot less nervous.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: It's been a while, Kujou Sara. I believe the last time we met was on the battlefield.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 02a.ogg Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 02b.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: That's right. (He's/She's) here to bear witness to the proceedings.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 03a.ogg Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 03b.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: (He/She) experienced the war between us firsthand, and has made an enormous contribution toward securing the peace we have today. I couldn't think of a more suitable candidate.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 04.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: That's fine. But if they're paying taxes, they should also be entitled to protection from the Tenryou Commission while in your waters.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 05.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Any losses they sustain due to issues of public security will need to be compensated by the Tenryou Commission.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 06.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: The problem there is that trade is a reciprocal affair. We'll need to involve merchants from both sides in this process if it is to succeed — we cannot give the Yashiro Commission full authority.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 07.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: True, we're experiencing some shortages, but we will recover in due course. Between the diverse range of goods we can produce ourselves and our strong trade links with other areas, we are capable of sourcing everything we need.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 08.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Not to mention that your proposal would require separate talks with the Kamisato Clan. If they've yet to sanction it, I believe you are going beyond the remit of the Tenryou Commission's authority.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 09.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: That just isn't feasible. Not in the short term, at least.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 10.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: The last one... but hold off for the moment.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 11.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Stand down, Tadakatsu. The situation has changed. Please stand by for further orders.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 12.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Rest assured, I am fully aware of your concerns. But I will deal with the situation from here.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 13.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Madame Kujou, this is rather serious. I believe you owe Watatsumi Island an explanation?
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 14.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hehehe... But of course, Madam Kujou. I have every confidence in your ability to resolve this situation.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 15.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: For the time being, however, there is evidently some discord within the Tenryou Commission's ranks. I would therefore not feel comfortable releasing Watatsumi Island's forces into your command at this time.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 16.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I should inform you that we took out a Fatui camp recently. I suspect that before long, they will attempt to reestablish contact with your people in the hope of procuring some assistance.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 17.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I recommend you say and do nothing on the matter for the time being, lest you tip them off and they disappear. Wait for them to come to you. That way, you can capture them all in one fell swoop.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kokomi 18.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's discuss it after we get back.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 01.ogg Kujou Sara: Yes... where you dealt my forces quite the devastating blow...
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 02.ogg Kujou Sara: But, before we go any further — what are you doing here?
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 03.ogg Kujou Sara: Seems reasonable. Then let's get straight into it.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 04.ogg Kujou Sara: The first item is the maritime administration issue. During wartime, we restricted fishing rights for Watatsumi vessels in Narukami waters...
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 05.ogg Kujou Sara: We intend to remove these restrictions. But going forward, any of your vessels that fish in our waters will have to pay taxes in accordance with Narukami legislation in order to bring their catch back to Watatsumi.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 06.ogg Kujou Sara: Accepted. Let's add that to the peace treaty. I can assure you that your vessels will be quite safe in our hands.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 07.ogg Kujou Sara: The next item has to do with the movement of people and military authority.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 08.ogg Kujou Sara: In the past, our people have been subjected to lengthy interrogations on arrival in Watatsumi, and the same has been true for your people on arrival to Narukami.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 09.ogg Kujou Sara: Economic cooperation between our islands has suffered greatly as a consequence. Few merchants are now willing to engage in inter-island commerce.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 10.ogg Kujou Sara: Since the war is now over, I propose that we have the Yashiro Commission appoint a business council to oversee trade between our two islands.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 11.ogg Kujou Sara: Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Watatsumi Island facing severe shortages of many essential goods at the moment? Having the Yashiro Commission organize everything centrally would work in your favor.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 12.ogg Kujou Sara: Let's leave that aside for now, then. On to the military question: Watatsumi Island's forces will need to come back under the jurisdiction of the Tenryou Commission.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 13.ogg Kujou Sara: With all due respect, feasibility doesn't come into it. The Tenryou Commission alone has ultimate responsibility for Inazuma's national security. We cannot allow Watatsumi Island to be the sole exception to this rule indefinitely...
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 14.ogg Kujou Sara: ...Excuse me for a moment. Nobody makes another move until I have finished investigating!
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 15.ogg Kujou Sara: You two. Here, now.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 16.ogg Kujou Sara: Speak. Collusion with the Fatui? Is this true?
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 17.ogg Kujou Sara: That's enough... When we return, there will be consequences.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 18.ogg Kujou Sara: Might I remind you that this is the Fatui? Have you completely forgotten what they did to us?
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 19.ogg Kujou Sara: You should be having no interaction with them whatsoever, let alone entertaining offers of cooperation!
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 20.ogg Kujou Sara: So, what did they want out of it?
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 21.ogg Kujou Sara: Oh, HER subordinates? ...So they're out for revenge. They want to keep Inazuma in a state of turmoil.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 22.ogg Kujou Sara: One day, I will hunt them down. Every last one.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 23.ogg Kujou Sara: We bear responsibility for this issue.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 24.ogg Kujou Sara: My sincere apologies. I have my own negligence to blame for this state of affairs. Please, grant us another chance to continue the peace talks.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 25.ogg Kujou Sara: It seems that I must acquiesce...
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 26.ogg Kujou Sara: I will lay this issue aside for now. But we shall revisit it as soon as the Tenryou Commission has resolved our internal issues.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 27.ogg Kujou Sara: As for the trade issues we raised, I will discuss options with the Yashiro Commission and make sure both sides have ample participation in the final arrangement...
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 28.ogg Kujou Sara: I never knew the grand strategist of Watatsumi Island was a skilled negotiator as well as a formidable commander.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 29.ogg Kujou Sara: I hope that when we meet again, we can continue these sit-down discussions... Settling our differences on the battlefield is rather taxing.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 30.ogg Kujou Sara: I think we can leave things there for today. Once I get back, I will conduct a thorough investigation into the Tenryou Commission's internal issues.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 31.ogg Kujou Sara: I will bear this in mind. Thank you.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 kujousara 32.ogg Kujou Sara: I shall take my leave now. Until we meet again.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 motosuke 01.ogg Motosuke: Umm...
Media:vo xhlq005 2 motosuke 02.ogg Motosuke: We were approached by a few Fatui... They mentioned a potential cooperation to keep the war against Watatsumi Island going...
Media:vo xhlq005 2 motosuke 03.ogg Motosuke: At the time, I felt like we could give it a try, after all there'd be nothing to lose...
Media:vo xhlq005 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Negotiations seem to be going pretty smoothly.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Kokomi! Which scenario number is this in the directives?
Media:vo xhlq005 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Seems like Kujou Sara's on the defensive now. These negotiations should be smooth sailing from here on out.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 sueyoshitaka 01.ogg Sue Yoshitaka: I wouldn't exactly call it "collusion" as such...
Media:vo xhlq005 2 sueyoshitaka 02.ogg Sue Yoshitaka: But we were extremely careful! We didn't agree to anything. We just said they could maybe start by heading to Watatsumi Island and stirring things up a little... then we'd see how it went.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 sueyoshitaka 03.ogg Sue Yoshitaka: With respect, Ma'am, there was no collusion! It was just a one-off conversation. How anyone from Watatsumi Island even found out about it I have no idea...
Media:vo xhlq005 2 sueyoshitaka 04.ogg Sue Yoshitaka: The Fatui's main forces have already left Inazuma. The few who approached us seemed like they wanted to settle a score for their boss.
Media:vo xhlq005 2 tadakatsu 01.ogg Tadakatsu: You Kujou scum! Colluding with the Fatui isn't low enough for you already? You just want to take everything away from us!
Media:vo xhlq005 2 tadakatsu 03.ogg Tadakatsu: Your Excellency, we—
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I have already been informed on the reasons for your actions.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: You believe the Tenryou Commission to be untrustworthy, and sought to sabotage the peace talks and re-ignite the war.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Fortunately, the end result exposed and thwarted a secret Tenryou Commission plot. Yet this was purely incidental, and the ends certainly did not justify your means.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 04.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I understand your sentiments... but you cannot simply impose your will and expect others to bear the consequences.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 05.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: During the war, there were highs and there were lows, and in the end there was a glorious victory. For you, perhaps the experience was one of great excitement.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 06.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: But you saw nothing of the countless others who will remember the war quite differently. Most people suffered terribly through each day.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 07.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Watatsumi Island's people yearn for peace because they have long since given all they had to the war effort. They are tired of treading water, and don't need you dragging them back underneath once again.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 08.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I understand, I do. And the fault is not yours alone.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 09.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: It was largely an oversight on my part: I taught you to nurture a warrior's will, but never how to let it go.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 10.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Very well. Then I hereby declare...
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 11.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: ... that as of today, I am founding a new Secret Corps of the army. This division will be responsible for keeping Watatsumi Island safe and secure, neutralizing any and all threats to the peace of our island.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 12.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: You and your comrades will all be welcome to join — but be warned, the training will be grueling. Perseverance and grit will be in high demand.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 13.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I have concluded from today's peace talks that the Kujou Clan cannot achieve absolute peace and stability in the near future. Many seek peace, but there are still those who pursue war.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 14.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: It is right that Watatsumi Island moves towards peace, but we must still retain a defensive capacity. Those whose warrior's will is alive and well, I invite you to embark on the most challenging training regimen of your lives.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 15.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I don't want to hear from any of you again until all of you can take on two Shogunate Samurai at a time!
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 16.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Alright, dismissed. Go and report to General Gorou. And remember... there can be no more insubordination.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 17.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: And if there is... there will be no more leniency from me. Whatever reasons you may have.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 18.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: *sigh* I think that's finally everything in hand.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 kokomi 19.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I can feel my energy levels starting to drop... Meet you back at the hideout for some rest?
Media:vo xhlq005 3 tadakatsu 01.ogg Tadakatsu: Your Excellency, y—you knew...?
Media:vo xhlq005 3 tadakatsu 02.ogg Tadakatsu: But Your Excellency, so many comrades have sacrificed themselves in the line of duty. If we stop now, aren't all of our efforts going to waste?
Media:vo xhlq005 3 tadakatsu 03.ogg Tadakatsu: I want to keep fighting! I want ultimate victory, even if it means I have to pay the ultimate price!
Media:vo xhlq005 3 tadakatsu 04.ogg Tadakatsu: Wait a minute! I... But...
Media:vo xhlq005 3 tadakatsu 05.ogg Tadakatsu: It's not your fault, Your Excellency! It was ours... our selfishness.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 tadakatsu 06.ogg Tadakatsu: Either way, we are ready to accept sentencing under martial law.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 tadakatsu 07.ogg Tadakatsu: Your Excellency... wh—what are you saying?
Media:vo xhlq005 3 tadakatsu 08.ogg Tadakatsu: ...Thank you, Your Excellency!
Media:vo xhlq005 3 tadakatsu 09.ogg Tadakatsu: ...Yes, Ma'am. From now on, we will focus on our training.
Media:vo xhlq005 3 tadakatsu 10.ogg Tadakatsu: Thank you for this opportunity, Your Excellency. We'll report to General Gorou right away!
Media:vo xhlq005 4 kokomi 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Thank you for everything. With your help, peace has been restored on Watatsumi Island once more.
Media:vo xhlq005 4 kokomi 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Recovering, slowly but surely... I should be raring to go before too long.
Media:vo xhlq005 4 kokomi 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Today was a reminder that I don't cope well in situations with lots of people. I've improved, but I still get nervous when more than a handful of people are involved.
Media:vo xhlq005 4 kokomi 04.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I think I might get Gorou to handle the negotiations next time...
Media:vo xhlq005 4 kokomi 05.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...Do you think so?
Media:vo xhlq005 4 kokomi 06.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: *sigh* To be honest, I'm still a long way off what's expected of a Divine Priestess.
Media:vo xhlq005 4 kokomi 07.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: In the past, I was concerned only with winning the war, restoring peace, and making sure everyone could live a happy life.
Media:vo xhlq005 4 kokomi 08.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: But I realize now that wasn't going far enough. People have all kinds of aspirations, and just as many measures of happiness.
Media:vo xhlq005 4 kokomi 09.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I have a long way to go. But that's okay. If I can't make the journey in one giant leap, I'll just have to settle for taking it one small step at a time...
Media:vo xhlq005 4 kokomi 10.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: In short... I've still got some maturing to do. Mm... Could you... stay here on Watatsumi Island? To keep me company for a while longer?
Media:vo xhlq005 cs paimon 01.ogg Paimon: No. 16... No, wait, 67... Or is it 73...
Media:vo xhlq005 cs paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Argh! Which one is it!
Media:vo xhlq005 cs samuraia 01.ogg Tenryou Samurai: Protect Madam Kujou!
Media:vo xhlq005 cs tadakatsu 01.ogg Tadakatsu: Comrades!
Media:vo xhlq005 cs tadakatsu 02.ogg Tadakatsu: Never trust the Kujou. Let's get them!
