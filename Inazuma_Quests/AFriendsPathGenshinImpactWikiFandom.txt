 It's part of life.
 Let's go visit them together.
 Long live the resistance!
 Ms. Hina?

Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Think nothing of it. I agreed to help, so it's only right that I do the best I can.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: (Traveler), could I trouble you to come back to Watatsumi Island with me?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: I want to find that soldier. Not to persuade him to stay, I just... I don't want him to leave without saying goodbye.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Kazuha once told me that the bonds between people whose paths have crossed can never be broken, even after they part ways.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: But... maybe I'm scared he might be wrong. People can change quickly, and I worry that the next time I meet my comrade who fought so bravely alongside me, there will already be some distance between us.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: Great. Then let's head off whenever you're ready.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 kuroda 01.ogg Kuroda: Great, that's all the replies for this round accounted for.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902701 kuroda 02.ogg Kuroda: Thank you for your hard work, Ms. Hi— Mr. Gorou.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 01.ogg Denjirou: General Gorou, and... Captain of Swordfish II?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 02.ogg Denjirou: General, Captain, are you here to inspect the camp?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 03.ogg Denjirou: To be honest... not much.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 04.ogg Denjirou: We're so busy even just with training and patrolling that it's almost impossible to squeeze in the time to meet up.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 05.ogg Denjirou: We have holidays, but we usually use them to go home and spend time with our nearest and dearest. Besides, everyone's vacations come at different times. Our schedules rarely overlap.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 06.ogg Denjirou: You know... having said all that, there's something else that I've always felt about this.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 07.ogg Denjirou: Yes. I feel that no matter how long we're apart, and no matter what we might go through in the meantime, all of us will be straight back here if Watatsumi Island is ever in danger.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 denjirou 08.ogg Denjirou: Even if we've all changed beyond recognition, we can always trust that we've got each other's backs. That's one thing that's never going to change!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Uh...not this time. I just thought I'd come by to catch up while everyone has some downtime.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Actually, I've had something on my mind, and wanted to ask everyone's thoughts on the matter.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: You see, after the war, Her Excellency streamlined the army, and a lot of people were transferred to other duties.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Do you still have much contact with each other?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: So that's really how it goes, huh...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: I know, it's okay, I just... it just seems a pity, that's all.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: Really?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: Heh... hahaha.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: Yes, that's the way it should be. Long live the resistance!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: I won't disturb you any further. You guys keep training hard. Regarding everything else, I'm sure it'll all be fine.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Tell him I'll be right over.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: I know what I have to do now... Come with me (Traveler), let's head to the camp.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: Denjirou is right. No matter what changes the future may bring, we will always have each other's backs.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: Sure, there may be some awkward silences when we meet again after a long time, but in no time at all we'd be the best of friends again.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 toshihiko 01.ogg Toshihiko: Certainly, General Gorou! Anything you want to discuss, we'll share whatever we know!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 toshihiko 02.ogg Toshihiko: But we haven't been out of the camp lately, so we don't have a whole lot of interesting stories...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 toshihiko 03.ogg Toshihiko: Yeah, I'm busy when they're free, and they're busy when I'm free.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 toshihiko 04.ogg Toshihiko: Anyway, even if we did manage to meet up — what then? We all do different jobs now, and we all have new friends who aren't mutually acquainted. I'm not sure what we'd talk about.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 toshihiko 05.ogg Toshihiko: We're your troops, General Gorou. You trained us, took us into battle, and led the way as we charged against the enemy.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 toshihiko 06.ogg Toshihiko: Even if we seldom keep in contact now, we are still brothers in arms. If you say the word, we will all pick up our weapons again at a moment's notice.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 toshihiko 07.ogg Toshihiko: Long live the resistance!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 tsuneo 01.ogg Tsuneo: Ah, General Gorou. You're here.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 tsuneo 02.ogg Tsuneo: I believe Hiroaki's been hoping to catch you. He's been waiting at the camp for a long time, but never saw you return.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902702 tsuneo 03.ogg Tsuneo: Are you planning to head back to camp later? If you're busy, I can go and let him know so he's not waiting there in vain.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: It's alright.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Ms. Hina? Who's that?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: Forget it, never mind her. I approve your application to leave the resistance.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Come on, don't look so down. It's not like we're never going to see each other again.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: If you ever have the time, you should come back and visit Watatsumi Island. There is no need to limit yourself to a specific place — just do what you want to do.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: No matter where we are, we will always be comrades.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: Take care!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: That was... that was okay.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: Or should I say... it's for the best? (Traveler).
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: This is how it should be... it should leave you with a smile on your face, just like this.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 01.ogg Hiroaki: General Gorou, I...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 02.ogg Hiroaki: I... I would like to request permission to leave the resistance, Sir!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 03.ogg Hiroaki: I know this may seem very abrupt, and in fact I have only just made the decision...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 04.ogg Hiroaki: Back then... I had so much hatred for the Vision Hunt Decree, and so much disappointment in Narukami Island for supporting it. But after the war ended, I wanted to go back and visit... but I still couldn't make up my mind...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 05.ogg Hiroaki: Thanks to Ms. Hina's encouragement, I was finally able to find the courage to talk to you about it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 06.ogg Hiroaki: Of course, if you disapprove, I'll obey your orders. I am your subordinate, after all.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 07.ogg Hiroaki: It's a long story...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 08.ogg Hiroaki: General Gorou... I...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 09.ogg Hiroaki: ...Yes, General!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902703 hiroaki 10.ogg Hiroaki: I'll take my leave then. Take care of yourself, General Gorou!
You send the soldiers off to the seashore...
