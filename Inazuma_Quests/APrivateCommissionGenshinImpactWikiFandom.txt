 Can you give me any more details?
 Hence why you came to me, an outlander.
 Not in the slightest.
 Quest DescriptionKamisato Ayaka seems to have something to discuss with you. Meet up for a chat with her at Komore Teahouse.
 What's the matter?
 You'd really never heard the name before? Not once?
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, Paimon. Hold on.
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Something has come up, and I would like to request your assistance.
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 03.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: But you ought not be nervous. This is not coming from the Yashiro Commission or the Kamisato Clan. It is my own individual request.
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 04.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Correct. It concerns my mother.
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 05.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: This may seem a little sudden... but in my view, you are the only person I can entrust this to.
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 06.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: A few days ago, I was sorting through some old family belongings when I found a notebook that belonged to my mother.
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 07.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: She wrote about all kinds of things, mostly of little consequence. But what drew my attention was a name — it is one that I have never heard before, so the fact that she mentions it so frequently... it makes it difficult for me to ignore...
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 08.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Never. And although my mother and father passed away many years ago, both my brother and I are familiar with the vast majority of their acquaintances.
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 09.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: So... I am very curious about this mysterious individual. I would very much like to meet them.
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 10.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: According to the notebook, their name is "Tsubaki." This seems to have been someone very important to my mother. Someone with a lot of personality, who liked to have fun.
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 11.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: That's what I thought too.
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 12.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: No, no, her address is given in the notebook — we can head straight there. I wanted you to assist me with the preparation of greeting gifts...
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 13.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: ...Please keep everything I have told you in strict confidence.
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 14.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: The proper course of action would be to involve my brother and visit her together, but he is terribly busy at present, and... on a more selfish note, I don't wish to involve anybody else from Inazuma in this matter.
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 15.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Exactly. That, and you are also a kind, well-mannered person with a genuine concern for other people... not to mention trustworthy. I would not feel comfortable with anyone else in this situation.
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 16.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Wonderful — in fact, I was hoping to take this opportunity to show you both around. If you don't mind, of course?
Media:vo aylq001 2 ayaka 17.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you kindly! Shall we head off, then? Ogura Textiles & Kimonos is our first stop.
Media:vo aylq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm, where do we go from here...? What's the plan?
Media:vo aylq001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? Ayaka?
Media:vo aylq001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Individual request? You mean... personal stuff?
Media:vo aylq001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Probably your mom's best buddy, right?
Media:vo aylq001 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Paimon thinks it sounds like a girl's name.
Media:vo aylq001 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: So, what do you want us to do?
Media:vo aylq001 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Do you need us to find her for you?
Media:vo aylq001 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: You can count on us! We've done greeting gifts before, so we should be able to help. In terms of payment... just treat us to some delicious food, and we'll be more than happy!
Media:vo aylq001 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Oh, we don't mind! We don't mind at all! Do we, (Traveler)?
Media:vo aylq001 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Alright! Sounds great!
