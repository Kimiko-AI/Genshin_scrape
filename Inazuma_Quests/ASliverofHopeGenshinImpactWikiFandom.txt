Media:vo xglq003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whew, these plants are getting a little out of control.
Media:vo xglq003 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, but this is someone's place, isn't it... Guess we can't go chopping everything down...

Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 09.ogg Yoimiya: You've finished already? Hehe, Mrs. Imatani will be really pleased.
Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 10.ogg Yoimiya: Let's take the pickled radish to Satoru. He's over on the other side of the village.

Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 11.ogg Yoimiya: Yeah, you got it. And that should just about do it.
Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 12.ogg Yoimiya: Satoru is on the other side of the village, let's go see him now.
 Congratulations to you both.
 Did you catch any of their names?
 I guess this is fate.
 I never would have imagined it either.
 Quest DescriptionThough you and Yoimiya managed to secure Sakujirou's passage out by sea, he wavers, unable to reconcile himself to his wish. It is at this moment that Yoimiya recalls an old couple among Naganohara Fireworks' clients who might be able to help him out.
 You should be very proud of what you have.
Media:vo dialog xglq003 imatanikaori 01.ogg Imatani Kaori: Thank you, dears. *sigh* Sorry to make you run errands for us.
Media:vo dialog xglq003 imatanikaori 02.ogg Imatani Kaori: One day, though, that child is going to have to face up to his feelings.
Media:vo dialog xglq003 imatanikaori 03.ogg Imatani Kaori: This is one life lesson that he can't learn from his parents.
Media:vo dialog xglq003 imatanisaburou 01.ogg Imatani Saburou: I'll brew some tea and prepare some snacks for when you get back.
Media:vo dialog xglq003 imatanisaburou 02.ogg Imatani Saburou: I'm sorry that we weren't much help.
Media:vo dialog xglq003 iwao 01.ogg Iwao: Oh... So we won't be able to scare off the Great Mujina Youkai anymore?
Media:vo dialog xglq003 matsuzaka 01.ogg Matsuzaka: That man who just came past looked really scary...
Media:vo dialog xglq003 saika 01.ogg Saika: Do you think... they're here to steal our weapons?
Media:vo dialog xglq003 satoru 01.ogg Satoru: The Naganohara Fireworks Show must be coming up soon, right? My daughter left quite a while ago.
Media:vo dialog xglq003 satoru 02.ogg Satoru: Heh, she couldn't get out the house quickly enough. She's clearly very taken with this boy in the city, it was written all over her face...
Media:vo dialog xglq003 satoru 03.ogg Satoru: *sigh* But, at least she's happy, I suppose.
Media:vo xglq003 1 imatanikaori 01.ogg Imatani Kaori: Well! If it isn't Yoimiya! Come on in, dear, come and take a seat.
Media:vo xglq003 1 imatanikaori 02.ogg Imatani Kaori: Are these two your friends?
Media:vo xglq003 1 imatanikaori 03.ogg Imatani Kaori: *sigh* We aren't as young as we once were, though. The body knows it.
Media:vo xglq003 1 imatanikaori 04.ogg Imatani Kaori: It used to be that I could spend all day working the land, carrying water back and forth, but now, even a moment of light work leaves me with all sorts of aches and pains.
Media:vo xglq003 1 imatanikaori 05.ogg Imatani Kaori: I wanted to do some weeding yesterday, but as soon as I bent down to get started, I suddenly felt that if I went any further, I wouldn't be able to get back up again.
Media:vo xglq003 1 imatanikaori 06.ogg Imatani Kaori: *sigh* You're such good kids... As for mine, he's all grown up now, hasn't found anyone yet, and he doesn't visit very often.
Media:vo xglq003 1 imatanikaori 07.ogg Imatani Kaori: If you're quite sure it's no trouble, then... I have some pickled radish here, would you mind delivering it to Satoru on the other side of the village?
Media:vo xglq003 1 imatanisaburou 01.ogg Imatani Saburou: Indeed, these are unprecedented times. But seeing as they came all this way, we locals should give them a warm welcome.
Media:vo xglq003 1 imatanisaburou 02.ogg Imatani Saburou: Oh, thank you, dear. Your family is so good to us, every year. First your father, and now you.
Media:vo xglq003 1 imatanisaburou 03.ogg Imatani Saburou: I wonder if I'll still be alive to see the next heir of Naganohara Fireworks.
Media:vo xglq003 1 imatanisaburou 04.ogg Imatani Saburou: No, no, no, we can't be putting you to work when you're a guest in our home.
Media:vo xglq003 1 imatanisaburou 05.ogg Imatani Saburou: I'll just go fetch the tea and some snacks, and then we'll continue our conversation.
Media:vo xglq003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ahem, why did you cut Paimon off earlier?
Media:vo xglq003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whew, these plants are getting a little out of control.
Media:vo xglq003 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, but this is someone's place, isn't it... Guess we can't go chopping everything down...
Media:vo xglq003 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: It's no trouble, really. We don't mind helping.
Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: Because what he needs isn't an answer, just time.
Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: Yes, they're travelers from afar. Outsiders have a very difficult time getting into Inazuma nowadays.
Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: Mm-hmm. Oh, before I forget — I brought the fireworks that you ordered.
Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 04.ogg Yoimiya: Of course you will, you're both in great health! Don't say things like that, it's bad luck.
Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 05.ogg Yoimiya: No worries, say no more — we'll handle it!
Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 06.ogg Yoimiya: It's fine, it's not like it's the first time I've helped you with chores. I just haven't had much time recently with the fireworks show coming up — but once that's outta the way, I'll be sure to come by more often.
Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 07.ogg Yoimiya: Sure, it won't take us a moment.
Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 08.ogg Yoimiya: The old folks aren't very mobile, so c'mon, let's help them out. We'll get rid of the weeds first and then deliver the pickled radish.
Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 09.ogg Yoimiya: You've finished already? Hehe, Mrs. Imatani will be really pleased.
Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 10.ogg Yoimiya: Let's take the pickled radish to Satoru. He's over on the other side of the village.
Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 11.ogg Yoimiya: Yeah, you got it. And that should just about do it.
Media:vo xglq003 1 yoimiya 12.ogg Yoimiya: Satoru is on the other side of the village, let's go see him now.
Media:vo xglq003 2 satoru 01.ogg Satoru: Same as usual, not much has changed. You're looking full of life, as always.
Media:vo xglq003 2 satoru 02.ogg Satoru: That must mean a lot more work for you though? Are you sure you and Mr. Ryuunosuke can manage?
Media:vo xglq003 2 satoru 03.ogg Satoru: If it gets too much, don't forget you can always ask me for help. Hmm?
Media:vo xglq003 2 satoru 04.ogg Satoru: Wow, thank you so much! I never used to be a fan of Pickled Radish, would you believe.
Media:vo xglq003 2 satoru 05.ogg Satoru: But then I tried some of Mrs. Imatani's homemade stuff, and I couldn't get enough of it. It's a family staple now.
Media:vo xglq003 2 satoru 06.ogg Satoru: They're doing well. We have the occasional heated argument, but... I guess that's every family ever.
Media:vo xglq003 2 satoru 07.ogg Satoru: Being close to family is better than never getting to see them, even if it does mean putting up with some conflict.
Media:vo xglq003 2 satoru 08.ogg Satoru: Now, Mr. and Mrs. Imatani seem to have a great relationship — but still, they must get lonely with their child never visiting.
Media:vo xglq003 2 satoru 09.ogg Satoru: I'm sure they'd love that — as would all of us in Konda Village. You're always welcome here.
Media:vo xglq003 2 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: Hey, Satoru, how have you been? Keeping well?
Media:vo xglq003 2 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: All thanks to the support of our loyal customers. The family business just keeps getting better and better.
Media:vo xglq003 2 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: We sold some fireworks to Liyue a while back, and word is they were a real hit. So it looks like we'll be getting more business from over there in the future.
Media:vo xglq003 2 yoimiya 04.ogg Yoimiya: We should be fine. I think we can cope.
Media:vo xglq003 2 yoimiya 05.ogg Yoimiya: Oh yeah, um, this is some Pickled Radish from Mrs. Imatani.
Media:vo xglq003 2 yoimiya 06.ogg Yoimiya: Speaking of your family, how is everyone doing?
Media:vo xglq003 2 yoimiya 07.ogg Yoimiya: Huh, they didn't seem that way to me. I think they're just used to it.
Media:vo xglq003 2 yoimiya 08.ogg Yoimiya: You make a good point though. I should drop by more often in the future. That way, they won't get so bored.
Media:vo xglq003 2 yoimiya 09.ogg Yoimiya: Hee-hee, thank you.
Media:vo xglq003 2 yoimiya 10.ogg Yoimiya: Now that we've finished all the chores, it's time to talk to the Imatanis about Sakujirou.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanikaori 01.ogg Imatani Kaori: That was quick! Ah, young people are so handy.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanikaori 02.ogg Imatani Kaori: Oh, so it has! Goodness, how the time flies... You barely notice as the years go by, but then suddenly, 50 years have passed.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanikaori 03.ogg Imatani Kaori: Oh, stop trying to impress them. We both know you were the one who was hopelessly smitten and desperately trying to win my affection...
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanikaori 04.ogg Imatani Kaori: 50 years... In some ways, it's a long time, in others, it's no time at all. Really, it's just a number.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanikaori 05.ogg Imatani Kaori: But 50 years of being together... now that is something worth commemorating.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanikaori 06.ogg Imatani Kaori: Oh, no, it's quite alright. We always set off the same firework every year. It wouldn't be the same without it.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanikaori 07.ogg Imatani Kaori: Seeing that firework go off takes us right back to those days. Even at this age, we still look back with not a single regret.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanikaori 08.ogg Imatani Kaori: He was our boy's best friend when they were young.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanikaori 09.ogg Imatani Kaori: *sigh* They were inseparable. They grew up together, shared everything with each other, and went everywhere together.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanikaori 10.ogg Imatani Kaori: But one day, they had a terrible argument...
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanikaori 11.ogg Imatani Kaori: If it was anything else, I could talk to Keisuke, and I'm sure he'd be willing to help.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanikaori 12.ogg Imatani Kaori: But since it's Sakujirou... I don't feel there's any way we can get involved.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanikaori 13.ogg Imatani Kaori: Yes, it'd be nice if they could go back to the way things were.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanisaburou 01.ogg Imatani Saburou: Speaking of youth... Do you know what? It's been 50 years this year.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanisaburou 02.ogg Imatani Saburou: Haha, well, if you must know, it was 50 years ago, back in the days when this young lady was still trying to win me over, that—
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanisaburou 03.ogg Imatani Saburou: Well, maybe you're right. 50 years ago, I proposed to my wife at the Naganohara Fireworks Show. We've been together ever since.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanisaburou 04.ogg Imatani Saburou: To tell the truth, I was still a little uncertain. I wasn't sure what I was doing when I walked into the Naganoharas' shop and ordered my firework.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanisaburou 05.ogg Imatani Saburou: Even as it was rising up into the sky... I still had no clue what I was going to say.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanisaburou 06.ogg Imatani Saburou: But then it exploded... the sky lit up... I looked back at her and saw her eyes, twinkling in the light of the fireworks...
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanisaburou 07.ogg Imatani Saburou: ...Before I knew what was happening, apparently, I'd already said it, and well, she'd said yes.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanisaburou 08.ogg Imatani Saburou: Enough about us, though. Yoimiya, aren't you busy with the fireworks show coming up? Was there something you needed to discuss?
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanisaburou 09.ogg Imatani Saburou: Hmm... Sakujirou... so, he came back.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanisaburou 10.ogg Imatani Saburou: Sakujirou seemed to feel that Inazuma was too peaceful, and wanted to see what the outside world was like.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanisaburou 11.ogg Imatani Saburou: But our Keisuke took after his father and mother. He felt that there was nothing wrong at all with being peaceful.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanisaburou 12.ogg Imatani Saburou: You know what children are like, they get terribly worked up about these sorts of things. In the end, Sakujirou stormed off, and that was that.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanisaburou 13.ogg Imatani Saburou: Keisuke said nothing to me or my wife about the fight. We could sense that he was very hurt by it, but he didn't want to talk with us about how he was really feeling.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanisaburou 14.ogg Imatani Saburou: Eventually, whether out of pent-up anger or for some other reason, he joined the Tenryou Commission. He rarely comes home anymore.
Media:vo xglq003 3 imatanisaburou 15.ogg Imatani Saburou: I think after all these years, they ought to let go of their grudges.
Media:vo xglq003 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: 50 years since what? Some important day?
Media:vo xglq003 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Aw, what a great relationship they have...
Media:vo xglq003 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What a strange coincidence. Who'd have thought...
Media:vo xglq003 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Two best buddies in childhood... one grows up to join the Tenryou Commission, the other grows up to join the Tenryou Commission's most wanted list...
Media:vo xglq003 3 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: Younger people have bundles of energy, and older people have a wealth of wisdom. Each have their strengths.
Media:vo xglq003 3 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: I had no idea it was your 50th anniversary. If I'd known, I would've made some extra-fancy fireworks, just for you.
Media:vo xglq003 3 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: Yeah, um... it's a difficult thing to talk about, but here goes...
Media:vo xglq003 3 yoimiya 04.ogg Yoimiya: Huh? You know him?
Media:vo xglq003 3 yoimiya 05.ogg Yoimiya: I see...
Media:vo xglq003 3 yoimiya 06.ogg Yoimiya: I understand now. When I asked Sakujirou why he came back, he just said "because of past mistakes" and wasn't willing to elaborate.
Media:vo xglq003 3 yoimiya 07.ogg Yoimiya: Now, I finally understand why he can't decide what to do.
Media:vo xglq003 3 yoimiya 08.ogg Yoimiya: Well, no worries, if that's the case then never mind.
Media:vo xglq003 3 yoimiya 09.ogg Yoimiya: We can find some other way to help Sakujirou, there's no need to make things difficult for you. This sounds like something for Sakujirou and Keisuke to resolve between themselves.
Media:vo xglq003 3 yoimiya 10.ogg Yoimiya: *sigh* Well, can't say we didn't try.
Media:vo xglq003 3 yoimiya 11.ogg Yoimiya: I'll let Sakujirou know after we get back.
Media:vo xglq003 4 morihiko 01.ogg Morihiko: As it happens, I did.
Media:vo xglq003 4 morihiko 02.ogg Morihiko: I was getting some ore from my friend's place and happened to bump into them on the way over.
Media:vo xglq003 4 morihiko 03.ogg Morihiko: I think their leader's name was Keisuke, just like you said.
Media:vo xglq003 4 naganohararyuunosuke 01.ogg Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Yoimiya, something bad's happened! Some people from the Tenryou Commission came by.
Media:vo xglq003 4 naganohararyuunosuke 02.ogg Naganohara Ryuunosuke: I told them the show was starting soon and the place was filled with fireworks, so they shouldn't go in because it's a fire hazard.
Media:vo xglq003 4 naganohararyuunosuke 03.ogg Naganohara Ryuunosuke: But they didn't listen. It seemed like they knew Sakujirou was inside.
Media:vo xglq003 4 naganohararyuunosuke 04.ogg Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Luckily, Sakujirou heard them coming in time and managed to escape through the window. The Tenryou Commission wasn't able to capture him.
Media:vo xglq003 4 naganohararyuunosuke 05.ogg Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Sorry, my ears are no good, and I didn't get a good look at them either. If you're wondering which way they went, they left the city.
Media:vo xglq003 4 naganohararyuunosuke 06.ogg Naganohara Ryuunosuke: I wish I caught their names... *sigh* But I didn't hear a thing...
Media:vo xglq003 4 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: Huh? Why? ... Do they know?
Media:vo xglq003 4 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: Pops, are you alright? They didn't do anything to you, did they?
Media:vo xglq003 4 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: This is bad news. I don't think Sakujirou had enough time to make his mind up...
Media:vo xglq003 4 yoimiya 04.ogg Yoimiya: Pops, did you see where he went?
Media:vo xglq003 4 yoimiya 05.ogg Yoimiya: The Tenryou Commission will definitely be chasing after him.
Media:vo xglq003 4 yoimiya 06.ogg Yoimiya: Good point! Names, we need names! Suddenly showing up like this, surely it must be Keisuke's doing!
Media:vo xglq003 4 yoimiya 07.ogg Yoimiya: The Commission wouldn't normally cause this big of a fuss over a stowaway.
Media:vo xglq003 4 yoimiya 08.ogg Yoimiya: Just as I thought! Thanks!
Media:vo xglq003 4 yoimiya 09.ogg Yoimiya: If Sakujirou still hasn't made up his mind, those two running into each other won't solve anything — and even worse, there'll be no coming back from it for Sakujirou.
Media:vo xglq003 4 yoimiya 10.ogg Yoimiya: We can't let that happen. Come with me, (Traveler), let's track them down!
Yoimiya tells the Imatanis about Sakujirou.
