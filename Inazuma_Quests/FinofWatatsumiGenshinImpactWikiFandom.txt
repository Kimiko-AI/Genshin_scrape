 Quest DescriptionYou must first break the five seals on Watatsumi Island if you wish to enter Enkanomiya.
 Step DescriptionAn ancient stone tablet stands beside the shrine. Will there be anything of use written on it?
 Step DescriptionWith the help of the stone tablet's instructions, perhaps breaking the shrine seal will not be a problem... Right?
 Step DescriptionYou have finally broken the shrine's seal, and the Spirit Pearl is yours to claim. Go forth and take it!
Ancient Stone Tablet: "...The two greet each other like scale and fin, like thigh and bone, ever connected, aiding in our great Omikami's rule..."
Ancient Stone Tablet: "For the retainers of other lands shall come from abroad..."
Paimon: And that's a third! We're getting close!
Paimon: Fourth Spirit Pearl obtained! Let's go find Tsuyuko!
Paimon: Look! The seal is broken! Let's go eat some fish!
Paimon: Ooh, now Paimon's hungry for fish...
Paimon: That fish over there also moved!
Paimon: There's another Spirit Pearl!
Paimon: This must be the "Fin" that Tsuyuko was talking about!
Paimon: Uh, "the two greet each other", huh... Maybe this means that we need to pair those fish statues we saw before off so they face the center of those big discs?
Paimon: We found a pearl. Is this the Spirit Pearl Tsuyuko talked about?
