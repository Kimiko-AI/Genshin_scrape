 ...?
 ...That really surprises me.
 Actually... I'm a bit of a pro in the kitchen.
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 16a.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: That's what I was thinking! You must have picked up a lot of knowledge about different cultures on your travels, hopefully including regional cuisines...
 Aw shucks, Ayaka...
 Cabbage + Cheese
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 09a.ogg Paimon: Mmm, yep! That's right!
 Don't be silly!
 Here it is.
 Hmm? really?
 I will take very good care of it.
 Is it a fight? Do you need backup?
 Is something the matter?
 It was all very tasty.
 It was nice to try something new.
 It's a beautiful gift, thank you very much.
 Mushroom + Flour
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 07a.ogg Paimon: Correctamundo!
 My time to shine.
 Naku Weed + Fluorescent Fungus
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 09b.ogg Paimon: Xiangling sure left a deep impression on you, huh...
Media:vo aylq003 3 ayaka 12b.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Oh? Who's Xiangling?
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 09b 1.ogg Paimon: A friend of ours who's a really talented chef, though she has some strange tastes... Still, she's one of Paimon's favorites!
 Quest DescriptionWhile the clothes are being made, Ayaka suggests that you and Paimon come with her to Kiminami Restaurant to dine.
 Sea Ganoderma + Lavender Melon
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 07b.ogg Paimon: Seriously? Okay, well, you're the chef...
 Step DescriptionWhile the garment is being made, Kamisato Ayaka offers to treat you and Paimon to a meal at Kiminami Restaurant. During that time, Ayaka also wants to finish a specially-made overseas cuisine. As you have seen much and are knowledgeable in the culinary arts, you decide to help. And who knows — the product of your kindness might be preserved somewhere in some form...
 Sure could.
 Sure thing.
 Was that an explosion?
 What's going on?
 Why would you be cooking?
 You could say my food is out of this world.
Media:vo aylq003 1 paimon 11b.ogg Paimon: Hey! Don't make this weird!
 You've got a friend in me.
I'm all ears.
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Miss Kiminami, how do you do?
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I believe so.
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 03.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: We'll be sticking to the order I placed in advance. As for the other matter we discussed... Thank you for your help.
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 04.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Go ahead and take a seat. There's something I need to take care of, but I'll be back momentarily.
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 05.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Ahem... It's nothing of that sort.
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 06.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I just have a few minor things I need to attend to. I won't be long.
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 07.ogg ???: Ah...!
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 08.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: *sigh* I'm so sorry, Traveler...
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 09.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Could you join me over there for a minute? Um... I need your help with something.
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 10.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I'm sorry! I didn't want to drag you away all of a sudden... I, um... just had a cooking catastrophe...
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 11.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: As you can see, this house is right next to the restaurant. It's where the owner lives.
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 12.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Actually, this whole compound is the family's private property. I asked Miss Kiminami to prepare some ingredients and utensils for me so that I could cook a special dish here.
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 13.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Actually... I wanted to cook something as a gift for Tsubaki.
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 14.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: My mother mentioned in here notebook that Tsubaki enjoys food from all over the world.
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 15.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: So I thought, if I'm going to meet Tsubaki, perhaps a dish from overseas would make a fitting gift...
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 16a.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: That's what I was thinking! You must have picked up a lot of knowledge about different cultures on your travels, hopefully including regional cuisines...
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 17.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Can I leave you to finish this task, then? Just as a personal favor... I—Is that okay...? I'll be indebted to you!
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 18.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Great! But... what kind of overseas dish would make a suitable gift? It needs to survive a journey from the kitchen to the recipient's doorstep...
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 19.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: ..."Pizza"?
Media:vo aylq003 1 ayaka 20.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: ...That does sound pretty good.
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 01.ogg Kiminami Anna: Welcome!
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 02.ogg Kiminami Anna: Aha, Miss Kamisato! Perfect timing. Your booking was for... Well, right now!
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 03.ogg Kiminami Anna: Excellent, no problem. And everything you asked for is ready and waiting.
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 04.ogg Kiminami Anna: Traveler, tiny customer, please wait here for a moment while I prepare your food.
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 05.ogg Kiminami Anna: So, you two are Miss Kamisato's friends?
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 06.ogg Kiminami Anna: Haha, well, we serve all the classics. Sure there are fancier-looking places out there, but the food here speaks for itself! Hope you enjoy it.
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 07.ogg Kiminami Anna: Over the years we've been in business, we've gotten to know the Kamisato Clan quite well.
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 08.ogg Kiminami Anna: Miss Kamisato and her brother are both fond of our food. They're always sending staff down here to order something and take it back to them.
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 09.ogg Kiminami Anna: Her table booking surprised me — not least because it was a group reservation! This is the first time I've ever heard of Miss Kamisato going out for dinner with friends!
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 10.ogg Kiminami Anna: Sure does, and I'm probably crossing the line here, but... I'm just telling you what others have told me. Apparently, Miss Kamisato doesn't have a lot of friends.
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 11.ogg Kiminami Anna: That's what I used to think, too. But it turns out the rules of social interaction are a bit more complicated than that.
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 12.ogg Kiminami Anna: Nobody in the neighborhood has a bad word to say about her. They all say she's beautiful, elegant, graceful, not to mention that she belongs to one of the most illustrious clans in the land. In short, they see her as a model young lady.
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 13.ogg Kiminami Anna: But that's just it — people look at her and see a model of perfection, and they don't feel like that's something they can relate to. So the majority of kids from ordinary families don't dare even try to talk to her.
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 14.ogg Kiminami Anna: So you see? On paper, she sounds like a girl everyone would want to get know, but in practice, she finds it difficult to make friends...
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 15.ogg Kiminami Anna: We don't speak all that much, but we do go quite a way back. I've always admired her for taking on so many responsibilities at such a young age.
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 16.ogg Kiminami Anna: So it makes me really happy to see her here with friends today!
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 17.ogg Kiminami Anna: Anyway — relax, enjoy your meal, and... please talk to her as much as possible. I know she'll appreciate it.
Media:vo aylq003 1 kiminamianna 18.ogg Kiminami Anna: Consider it a favor for the whole neighborhood... Look after her for us!
Media:vo aylq003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Are we here? Ooh, it's one of those streetside places! Looks cute and cozy!
Media:vo aylq003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon She sure left in a hurry... Whatever it is, it must be pretty urgent.
Media:vo aylq003 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: The first time ever!? Whoa... Guess that makes us pretty important people, huh!
Media:vo aylq003 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: How is that possible? She's so kind and polite to everyone, Paimon would've thought that would make her really popular.
Media:vo aylq003 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh, Paimon never would have guessed...
Media:vo aylq003 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Huh? That sounded like Ayaka...!
Media:vo aylq003 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Ooh, so that loud noise we heard came from the cooking pot...
Media:vo aylq003 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Right! If there's something you wanna eat, you could just order it from the menu!
Media:vo aylq003 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: A dish from overseas? So anything from outside Inazuma counts, right?
Media:vo aylq003 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: If so... then we've got lots of options, don't we?
Media:vo aylq003 1 paimon 11b.ogg Paimon: Hey! Don't make this weird!
Media:vo aylq003 1 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon knows! There's one dish out there that was practically created for this purpose!
Media:vo aylq003 1 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Pizza~!
Media:vo aylq003 1 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: It's an assortment of toppings and sauce spread over a bread base and cooked in the oven. And it's so good!
Media:vo aylq003 2 kiminamianna 01.ogg Kiminami Anna: Hi Traveler — is everything okay?
Media:vo aylq003 2 kiminamianna 02.ogg Kiminami Anna: I don't see Ayaka looking so flustered very often... Whatever it is, it must be a tricky situation.
Media:vo aylq003 3 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Is the pizza ready?
Media:vo aylq003 3 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: *sniff* It smells delicious... You're an excellent cook, Traveler.
Media:vo aylq003 3 ayaka 03.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: *sigh* I would love to be able to master dishes from all over the world...
Media:vo aylq003 3 ayaka 04.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Great! I look forward to learning from your culinary expertise.
Media:vo aylq003 3 ayaka 05.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, an overseas dish cooked by the Traveler.
Media:vo aylq003 3 ayaka 06.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Could I trouble you to package it for me?
Media:vo aylq003 3 ayaka 07.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Oh! Could you?
Media:vo aylq003 3 ayaka 08.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: You could have sold that recipe for a high price, but you selflessly gave it away for free...
Media:vo aylq003 3 ayaka 09.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: ...You're a wonderful person.
Media:vo aylq003 3 ayaka 10.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I mean it... I admire you a lot, and I'm so proud to be friends with someone of such fine character.
Media:vo aylq003 3 ayaka 11.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Well, you should probably write down the recipe now, no?
Media:vo aylq003 3 ayaka 12b.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Oh? Who's Xiangling?
Media:vo aylq003 3 ayaka 13.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I have no doubt that they will. This dish is exquisite.
Media:vo aylq003 3 kiminamianna 01.ogg Kiminami Anna: How are you all doing?
Media:vo aylq003 3 kiminamianna 02.ogg Kiminami Anna: Whoa, is this...? Miss Kamisato, this must be the dish you were talking about?
Media:vo aylq003 3 kiminamianna 03.ogg Kiminami Anna: Sure, no problem!
Media:vo aylq003 3 kiminamianna 04.ogg Kiminami Anna: Ooh, it smells good! I bet it tastes amazing. Aw, now I really want to put something like this on our menu...
Media:vo aylq003 3 kiminamianna 05.ogg Kiminami Anna: Really? Aw, that's great, I've always wanted to learn how to cook some international dishes!
Media:vo aylq003 3 kiminamianna 06.ogg Kiminami Anna: If you can write down a recipe for me, I'll add it to our menu and put a promotion where everyone will see it!
Media:vo aylq003 3 kiminamianna 07.ogg Kiminami Anna: Since we became a closed nation, people haven't had the chance to try anything new. Traveler, you're the best!
Media:vo aylq003 3 kiminamianna 08.ogg Kiminami Anna: I'll go pack up this dish for Miss Kamisato. Please make your way back to the restaurant whenever you're ready, the food will be waiting for you.
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh, it's ready!
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Well, all you need to learn is a recipe. We can bring you some more recipes in the future, if you like.
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hehe, want us to teach you how to make it?
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon The most satisfying meals are the ones you share with other people. So Paimon thinks that our friends in Mondstadt wouldn't mind us sharing this dish with Inazuma.
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Yeah, (Traveler), let's make sure we include all the details and then give it to Miss Kiminami!
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: So, pizza! Start with the basic ingredients.
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 07a.ogg Paimon: Correctamundo!
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 07b.ogg Paimon: Seriously? Okay, well, you're the chef...
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Right, now to add the next couple of ingredients!
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 09a.ogg Paimon: Mmm, yep! That's right!
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 09b 1.ogg Paimon: A friend of ours who's a really talented chef, though she has some strange tastes... Still, she's one of Paimon's favorites!
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 09b.ogg Paimon: Xiangling sure left a deep impression on you, huh...
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Now to add the cooking instructions... "Place onto oven rack at high heat and cook till golden brown."
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Alright, it's done!
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Long may our reputations and our recipes precede us, wherever we go in Inazuma!
Media:vo aylq003 3 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Cool, then let's get this recipe to Miss Kiminami, pronto!
Media:vo aylq003 4 kiminamianna 01.ogg Kiminami Anna: Hey! Have you written out the recipe?
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Here it is!
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, Paimon, please accept my sincerest apologies for delaying your meal.
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 03.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Alright, let's dig in before it gets cold.
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 04.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Well, what do you think? Is Inazuman cuisine to your liking?
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 05.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Haha, good. I'm relieved.
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 06.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Um... When I was attempting to cook earlier on, did you... chat with the owner at all?
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 07.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: And did she, uh... say anything about me?
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 08.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: She's... happy for me?
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 09.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Oh... then... she must have told you. D—Did she, um...
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 10.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: *sigh* What does it matter... I know just as well as anybody else that I've got no friends...
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 11.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you for your comforting words, Paimon.
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 12.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: It's all true though. I just... don't have very many friends.
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 13.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Most of the time I'm either accompanied by family or staff. So everyone must have found it quite a surprise to see me taking you out for a meal...
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 14.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Aw...
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 15.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you... that makes me so happy!
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 16.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Ahem, excuse me... I—I'm forgetting myself.
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 17.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I agree! So...
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 18.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I just want to say how happy I feel... that you both see me as a true friend.
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 19.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Yes! I think friendship is an extremely precious thing, and ours is one that I will always treasure.
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 20.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Well, I think I have an idea, but it's just speculative at this point.
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 21.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I think that Tsubaki... might be a fox envoy!
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 22.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Yes. That's what I think.
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 23.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Even I, my mother's own daughter, had never ever heard of this friend before. It just seems so mysterious. So I think it must be someone with transcendent abilities who doesn't show themselves very often.
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 24.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: And fox envoys are nothing new. Stories have been told about them in Inazuma since ancient times.
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 25.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: You must have met Guuji Yae before? Well, she's a fox envoy!
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 26.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: That got me thinking, maybe there are fox envoys out there in Inazuma that people just don't know about... and maybe Tsubaki is one of them.
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 27.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Uh, when you say "also"...
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 28.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Really... I have come across such things being asserted in books, but to hear someone talk about it from firsthand experience is extremely surprising.
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 29.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: So, Liyue lives up to its reputation... Its culture has a long history and gives rise to the most beautiful legends. Quite captivating.
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 30.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Really? I would love that!
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 31.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Speaking of delicacies — Traveler, Paimon, have you eaten your fill?
Media:vo aylq003 5 ayaka 32.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Excellent, then let's collect the kimono. Then we can pay a visit to my mother's mysterious and transcendent friend...
Media:vo aylq003 5 kiminamianna 01.ogg Kiminami Anna: Thank you!
Media:vo aylq003 5 kiminamianna 02.ogg Kiminami Anna: Wowee, this is so exciting! I want to make it right away.
Media:vo aylq003 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hehe, no problem! Food always tastes better when you've worked up an appetite.
Media:vo aylq003 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's amazing! Paimon loved this one... Oh! And especially that one over there.
Media:vo aylq003 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: She did, but don't worry, she's just happy for you is all.
Media:vo aylq003 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hey, it's not you, most people just haven't had the chance to talk to you one-on-one before.
Media:vo aylq003 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Exactly! You've got at least two friends right here!
Media:vo aylq003 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hey now, expressing your feelings is the right thing to do. Keeping them locked away inside isn't gonna do you any good, now is it?
Media:vo aylq003 5 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Of course we do. That's always been our style - if someone's nice to us, we're nice to them, too!
Media:vo aylq003 5 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Friendship can go a long way! Take your mom for example — she wrote about Tsubaki in her notebook, and now it's made you want to find them, too.
Media:vo aylq003 5 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Um, while we're on the topic though — who is this Tsubaki person, anyway?
Media:vo aylq003 5 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: A fox envoy?
Media:vo aylq003 5 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Whoa, so Inazuma also has supernatural beings?
Media:vo aylq003 5 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Well, before Inazuma we spent some time in Liyue. They have lots of supernatural beings there, like the adepti.
Media:vo aylq003 5 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: All kinds of them, too... Up in the sky, down below the ground, in the water...
Media:vo aylq003 5 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: You should come visit Liyue with us some time. The best part is... they have loads and loads of delicious delicacies!
Media:vo aylq003 5 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon has!
Media:vo aylq003 6 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you very much.
Media:vo aylq003 6 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, I have a gift for you.
Media:vo aylq003 6 ayaka 03.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: It's a hairpin in the style of a white heron. As well as a hair accessory, you can also use it as an ornament.
Media:vo aylq003 6 ayaka 04.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I couldn't ask for your help and offer nothing at all in return, so this is my gift to you.
Media:vo aylq003 6 ayaka 05.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I'm glad you like it!
Media:vo aylq003 6 ayaka 06.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Hehe, you flatter me, Paimon. If this gift reminds you of me, that is all I could ask for.
Media:vo aylq003 6 oguramio 01.ogg Ogura Mio: Your garment is ready, Miss Kamisato. I've folded and packages it for you.
Media:vo aylq003 6 oguramio 02.ogg Ogura Mio: Oh, and the other item we discussed — that's ready too!
Media:vo aylq003 6 oguramio 03.ogg Ogura Mio: No, thank you! It is a beautiful piece of clothing, and it was a pleasure to work on. See you again next time!
Media:vo aylq003 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa... Looks super fancy! Is that for wearing in your hair?
Media:vo aylq003 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Speaking of white herons, that's what your title means, doesn't it? Shirasagi Himegimi. So this gift is like a little piece of yourself. It's just as elegant and beautiful as you are.
Media:vo aylq003 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hee-hee, it definitely will.
Media:vo aylq003 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Alright, well, now we've got what we came for, we can set off.
Media:vo aylq003 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Time to go meet Tsubaki!
You head towards the great noise...
