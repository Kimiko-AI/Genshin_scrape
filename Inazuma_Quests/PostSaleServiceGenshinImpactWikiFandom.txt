 All the mushrooms are here.
Konda Densuke: That's all? I remember there being a lot more. Did you really clear them all out?
Konda Densuke: Anyway, you have my appreciation, youngster. Take this as payment.

 Got all the mushrooms right here.
Konda Densuke: There were so many mushrooms, but looks like you did get them all.
Konda Densuke: Thank you, youngster. I really don't know what I would do without your help. Take this as a token of my gratitude.
 All the mushrooms are here.
 Got all the mushrooms right here.
 How about we ask Alrani to work on this issue?
Vahid: If she was here, we would have figured it out quite quickly.
Vahid: But she hasn't returned yet, and I have no idea where she went.
Vahid: I can only count on you, Traveler. I will be doing some research in the store to see what exactly caused this...
 I'm here to clear the mushrooms!
 Is he satisfied with the fertilizers?
 Lost?
 Quest DescriptionVahid, the owner of Syavushi Bakshesh Shoppe, seems to have received complaints from a client...
 Sorry for the trouble!
Konda Densuke: Oh, the mushrooms? Well, there's no shortage of them on my dining table, that's for sure.
 What's the matter?
 You can count on me.
Vahid: That I will. I will be doing some research in the store to see what exactly caused this...
Vahid: *sigh* If only Alrani were here. She would definitely have found the cause already.
Konda Densuke: Anyway, you have my appreciation, youngster. Take this as payment.
Konda Densuke: Have you cleared them all?
Konda Densuke: Hmm, then they're all yours. There are way too many mushrooms in the field. It's not a job for an old timer like me.
Konda Densuke: How could these mushrooms have grown so fast...
Konda Densuke: I have to say that these fertilizers are quite amazing. The mushrooms grew so quickly. If only they could help the crops grow this fast as well...
Konda Densuke: Oh, the mushrooms? Well, there's no shortage of them on my dining table, that's for sure.
Konda Densuke: Thank you, youngster. I really don't know what I would do without your help. Take this as a token of my gratitude.
Konda Densuke: That's all? I remember there being a lot more. Did you really clear them all out?
Konda Densuke: There were so many mushrooms, but looks like you did get them all.
Konda Densuke: Were you sent by Mr. Vahid to help me clear them away?
Konda Densuke: What is the matter with these mushrooms...
Konda Densuke: When I've got the time, I will surely come buy some more and try them out...
Konda Densuke: Why did these mushrooms grow so quickly?
Paimon: Phew, looks like that's that!
Paimon: That should be all of them, right?
Vahid: *sigh* If only Alrani were here. She would definitely have found the cause already.
Vahid: But anyway, it definitely has something to do with the fertilizers.
Vahid: But she hasn't returned yet, and I have no idea where she went.
Vahid: Do you still remember Konda Densuke? He came to the store several days ago, asking about the fertilizers.
Vahid: However, although the crops did grow well, at the same time... a lot of mushrooms came out of nowhere...
Vahid: I can only count on you, Traveler. I will be doing some research in the store to see what exactly caused this...
Vahid: I wouldn't put it in those terms. Strictly speaking, I think Mr. Konda Densuke is feeling lost.
Vahid: If she was here, we would have figured it out quite quickly.
Vahid: Oh no... how did this happen?
Vahid: That I will. I will be doing some research in the store to see what exactly caused this...
Vahid: To be honest, after Mr. Konda told me about it, I am also feeling a bit lost.
Vahid: Traveler, I was just looking for you!
Vahid: Traveler, could you please go to Konda Village and help Mr. Konda clear those mushrooms out of his fields?
Vahid: Well, here's the thing. After your previous promotion, Mr. Densuke did use our fertilizers according to your instructions.
