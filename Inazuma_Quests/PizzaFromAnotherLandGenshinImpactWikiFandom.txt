Kiminami Anna: Miss Matsumoto said that although the pizza in my shop incorporates a lot of ingredients from Inazuma, she heard that Mondstadt pizza is not made like this.
Kiminami Anna: She said that for such outland delicacies, it's better to retain it's authentic flavor...
Kiminami Anna: *sigh* But how am I going to know how to make Mondstadt's pizza? Traveler, please help me ask her.

Kiminami Anna: Miss Rie said that although the taste of this pizza is not bad...
Kiminami Anna: But she felt that the pizza would taste better if it incorporated some of Inazuma's local ingredients.
Kiminami Anna: I wonder what ingredients she would like to see... Traveler, please help me ask her.

 I'll take care of it.
Kiminami Anna: I'm counting on you, then. Just a block of Cheese will do.
 I'm on it.

 Quest DescriptionKiminami Anna from Kiminami Restaurant seems to be bothered by something...
 Umm, need some help?
 What happened?
 You don't really use Cheese in the store?
Kiminami Anna: It's not that we don't use it at all, we just use it very rarely.
Kiminami Anna: After all, there are not many dishes in the store that require Cheese, so we don't really stock much of it...
Kiminami Anna: Anyway, I'm counting on you, Traveler. Please help to bring me a block of Cheese.
 You got it!
Kiminami Anna: Great! By the way, I've also collected feedback from customers. Give me a moment, I'll look for it.
Kiminami Anna starts making pizza...
Kiminami Anna: *sigh* But how am I going to know how to make Mondstadt's pizza? Traveler, please help me ask her.
(Go to Cheese Version)
Kiminami Anna: *sigh* Maybe I'm really not good at making pizza...
Kiminami Anna: *sigh* What am I to do...
Kiminami Anna: After all, there are not many dishes in the store that require Cheese, so we don't really stock much of it...
Kiminami Anna: Although I have tried several methods to make new types of pizza based on feedback from customers...
Kiminami Anna: Anyway, I'm counting on you, Traveler. Please help to bring me a block of Cheese.
Kiminami Anna: But I always feel... that something is lacking, and the response from customers is not very good.
Kiminami Anna: But she felt that the pizza would taste better if it incorporated some of Inazuma's local ingredients.
Kiminami Anna: But... some customers also said that they were bored of eating this pizza all the time and asked if I have other pizza flavors.
Kiminami Anna: Do you remember the recipe you wrote for me the last time, when you and Ms. Kamisato came to my store?
Kiminami Anna: Do you want to take a look at the customer feedback?
Kiminami Anna: Give me a moment, I'll look for it.
Kiminami Anna: Great! By the way, I've also collected feedback from customers. Give me a moment, I'll look for it.
Kiminami Anna: Have you brought the ingredients back with you?
Kiminami Anna: Have you brought the ingredients back with you?
(Give Lavender Melon Ã—1)
Kiminami Anna: Hmm, Sea Ganoderma? Naku Weed? Oh, how about Fluorescent Fungus...
Kiminami Anna: How did it go, any feedback?
Kiminami Anna: I wonder what a pizza made with Inazuma's local ingredients would taste like...
Kiminami Anna: I wonder what ingredients she would like to see... Traveler, please help me ask her.
(Go to Lavender Melon Version)
Kiminami Anna: I'll make sure to savor this pizza's taste...
Kiminami Anna: I'm counting on you, then. Just a block of Cheese will do.
Kiminami Anna: If it's not bad... it should be officially launched as a new dish soon.
Kiminami Anna: It's done!
Kiminami Anna: It's not that we don't use it at all, we just use it very rarely.
Kiminami Anna: Miss Matsumoto said that although the pizza in my shop incorporates a lot of ingredients from Inazuma, she heard that Mondstadt pizza is not made like this.
Kiminami Anna: Miss Rie said that although the taste of this pizza is not bad...
Kiminami Anna: Mm, I'm counting on you then. Just one Lavender Melon will do.
Kiminami Anna: Oh! I'm sorry, I was busy thinking about what ingredients to put in! Let's see, I don't think there's much Lavender Melon left in the store...
Kiminami Anna: Oh, that pizza was so popular that many customers came to the store to order it specially.
Kiminami Anna: Pizza made with Lavender Melon... That's not too complicated...
Kiminami Anna: She said that for such outland delicacies, it's better to retain it's authentic flavor...
Kiminami Anna: Thank you, these ingredients will do.
Kiminami Anna: Thanks for your help, Traveler. Here, these are for you.
Kiminami Anna: The ingredients to prepare are Cheese, Cabbage, and Mushrooms...
Kiminami Anna: The original Mushroom Pizza from Mondstadt, I don't know if I can make it successfully...
Kiminami Anna: The original Mushroom Pizza... Hmm, it's worth a try.
Kiminami Anna: The rest of the ingredients just need to be prepared as usual. Well, since the feedback said to "incorporate some of Inazuma's local ingredients," then I can add some other ingredients...
Kiminami Anna: There are still some other ingredients in stock in the store. Just bring back a Lavender Melon, please.
Kiminami Anna: This pizza looks... pretty good...
Kiminami Anna: Traveler, could I trouble you to get a block of Cheese?
Kiminami Anna: Traveler, please help me get a Lavender Melon. When it comes to ingredients... this should be all that's missing.
Kiminami Anna: Traveler, you know a lot about this dish, right? Can you give me some advice?
Kiminami Anna: Traveler, you've returned.
Kiminami Anna: Traveler? Great, you have perfect timing!
Kiminami Anna: We have the other ingredients, but we usually don't stock up on Cheese...
Matsumoto: *sigh* Is there anything in the world that will satisfy my taste buds?
Matsumoto: Hahaha, I just feel that for such outland delicacies, it's better to retain it's authentic flavor.
Matsumoto: However, I have tried the authentic Mushroom Pizza before.
Matsumoto: I remember that the pizza was made of Cheese, Cabbage, and Mushrooms...
Matsumoto: Oh, the pizza you mentioned tastes really good, and it also has a lot of local ingredients.
Matsumoto: The Mushroom Pizza tastes really good, you must try it if you have the chance.
Rie: But... how do I put this, I'm not very used to its flavor.
Rie: I just think that if you can mix some of Inazuma's local ingredients into the pizza, such as Lavender Melon...
Rie: Maybe, the pizza will be more popular with everyone.
Rie: Oh, hello. Can I help you with something?
Rie: Oh, that pizza tastes really good.
Rie: Pizza made with Lavender Melon... I wonder how it tastes...
