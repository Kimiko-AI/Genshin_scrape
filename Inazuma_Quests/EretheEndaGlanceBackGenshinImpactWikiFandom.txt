(Kazuha picks up the Prized Isshin Blade and a purple glow takes over Kazuha's eyes)
(He awakes in a realm of consciousness)

(The opponent is defeated instantly)
Media:vo wylq103 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: That was such a close call...
Media:vo wylq103 5 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: My apologies... in the end, I still needed your help.
 I trust your judgment.
 I'll hold you to your word!
 It really looks like it's about to break.
 It's grown... dimmer?
 Quest DescriptionAs it turns out, the one behind the missing-person case is a cursed blade that has possessed Amenoma Yuuya's body. To save the latter and to prove the absurdity of the blade's fixation, Kazuha eventually takes up the cursed blade himself.
 Step DescriptionHaving recognized that he is not on the same level as Kazuha, the cursed blade releases Amenoma Yuuya and seems to have contained his malice for now, though his obsession has not thus diminished...
 Thank you.
 That was a much more relaxed occasion.
 The decision is yours.
 The remnants of defeated gods are nothing to scoff at.
 The wear and tear is severe.
 Though the truth is right there in front of him.
 Too dangerous, if you ask me.
 What's going on?
 Will he listen to you?
 You shouldn't fight with this blade anymore.
After leaving the Amenoma Smithy, you learn of the blade's final words from Kazuha.
Amenoma Yuuya finally regains consciousness. The party explains the situation to him.
Cutscene's Travel Log summary:
Putting forth the last remnants of its power, the prized Isshin blade exhorts Kaedehara Kazuha to go to the anvil in the smithy. Its final wish is to be reforged at the cost of everything that comprises its present consciousness. At its instruction, Kazuha hammers and forges, and the red blade slowly regains its luster. In this manner is the Isshin Art at last revived and continued...

Media:vo dialog wylq103 kujoukamaji 01.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Mr. Nagato's survival is the one silver lining in this whole catastrophe.
Media:vo dialog wylq103 kujoukamaji 02.ogg Kujou Kamaji: We will continue to monitor his condition, and hope he recovers soon.
Media:vo wylq103 1 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Leave everything on this journey to me.
Media:vo wylq103 10 amenomayuuya 01.ogg Amenoma Yuuya: Successor of Amenoma Art, Amenoma Yuuya.
Media:vo wylq103 10 amenomayuuya 02.ogg Amenoma Yuuya: It is my honor also.
Media:vo wylq103 10 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Ready?
Media:vo wylq103 10 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Okay. Alright then.
Media:vo wylq103 10 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Successor of Isshin Art, Kaedehara Kazuha.
Media:vo wylq103 10 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Honored to cross blades with you.
Media:vo wylq103 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: This reminds Paimon a bit of The Crux Clash.
Media:vo wylq103 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yup, we still can't let our guard down, even now. Paimon has a sneaking suspicion that blade hasn't told us everything...
Media:vo wylq103 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Still... even if he's way past the point of redemption, it's hard not to feel a teensy bit sorry for him.
Media:vo wylq103 10 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Are you ready?
Media:vo wylq103 11 amenomayuuya 01.ogg Amenoma Yuuya: ...Thank you for the experience.
Media:vo wylq103 11 amenomayuuya 02.ogg Amenoma Yuuya: Although he appears battered and broken, in your hands, it seems he's regained a glimmer of brilliance.
Media:vo wylq103 11 amenomayuuya 03.ogg Amenoma Yuuya: His sense of savage cruelty has completely faded away, but that same sense of determination remains strong.
Media:vo wylq103 11 amenomayuuya 04.ogg Amenoma Yuuya: You need not seek my forgiveness, nor do I have the right to forgive you on your victims' behalf.
Media:vo wylq103 11 amenomayuuya 05.ogg Amenoma Yuuya: It is too late for all of that.
Media:vo wylq103 11 amenomayuuya 06.ogg Amenoma Yuuya: Yes. I, too, trust Mr. Kaedehara to do the right thing.
Media:vo wylq103 11 kagotsurubeisshin 01.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: I must apologize to you for all that has transpired.
Media:vo wylq103 11 kagotsurubeisshin 02.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: I do not wish for forgiveness. I only hope that you will see my transgressions as mine alone, and not let them stain the legacy of Isshin Art.
Media:vo wylq103 11 kagotsurubeisshin 03.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: I strayed far from the straight and narrow path, but the Isshin Art still has a worthy successor in Kaedehara Kazuha.
Media:vo wylq103 11 kagotsurubeisshin 04.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: I beseech you... please understand this.
Media:vo wylq103 11 kagotsurubeisshin 05.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Thank you, successor of Amenoma Art.
Media:vo wylq103 11 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: You also fought well. I'm sure he relished the experience.
Media:vo wylq103 11 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: There are a few things that I shall leave him to tell you himself.
Media:vo wylq103 11 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: This blade has also told me that he has another wish: He would like to visit the Amenoma Smithy.
Media:vo wylq103 11 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Maybe we can go back there together.
Media:vo wylq103 11 kazuha 05.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I'm not sure. But I think that all this is about to come to an end.
Media:vo wylq103 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What does he want to go there for?
Media:vo wylq103 12 amenomatoogo 01.ogg Amenoma Tougo: Ah, it's Yuuya! You have returned!
Media:vo wylq103 12 amenomatoogo 02.ogg Amenoma Tougo: A prized Isshin blade, turned weapon that controls the human mind...
Media:vo wylq103 12 amenomatoogo 03.ogg Amenoma Tougo: *sigh* Considering their forging philosophy, this was indeed within the realm of possibility. This is a great pity.
Media:vo wylq103 12 amenomatoogo 04.ogg Amenoma Tougo: But I have some good news as well. Ryuuji from the Bantan Sango Detective Agency tells me that they've found the missing Mr. Nagato.
Media:vo wylq103 12 amenomatoogo 05.ogg Amenoma Tougo: Yes. Badly wounded, but he will live.
Media:vo wylq103 12 amenomatoogo 06.ogg Amenoma Tougo: And now that Yuuya is back... it seems like the final ending to this story is a happy one after all.
Media:vo wylq103 12 amenomayuuya 01.ogg Amenoma Yuuya: I am sorry to have troubled you. It's all thanks to them that I was able to return safely.
Media:vo wylq103 12 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: ...I think I know what you want to do.
Media:vo wylq103 12 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes... he said, he wants to take control of me for a brief moment.
Media:vo wylq103 12 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: He tells me that he's thought of another way to fulfill his maker's wish. And he assures me that he won't use my body for anything nefarious.
Media:vo wylq103 12 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I've decided... to let him do it.
Media:vo wylq103 12 kazuha 05.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Thank you. I will explain my reasons later.
Media:vo wylq103 12 kazuha 06.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Okay, I am ready. Let us begin, please stay true to your promise.
Media:vo wylq103 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Really? Is he okay?
Media:vo wylq103 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What's wrong, Kazuha? Is the blade whispering in your ear again?
Media:vo wylq103 12 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What? No way! Hasn't it learned its lesson?
Media:vo wylq103 12 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: You...! But...! He...! Ugh, guess there's nothing we can say to change your mind, huh?
Media:vo wylq103 13 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: "Kagotsurube Isshin"... It was the first time I ever heard his name.
Media:vo wylq103 13 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: It seems like deep down, he disapproved of his own actions, and thus chose to bury this name deep within his heart.
Media:vo wylq103 13 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Only in the final moments before his consciousness faded was he willing to entrust it to another.
Media:vo wylq103 13 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: The same fervent ambition that gave him the motivation to keep going forward also fueled the stubborn determination that blinded him to the path ahead.
Media:vo wylq103 13 kazuha 05.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Speaking for myself, I'd rather see him recognize and atone for his mistakes than see him punished for them.
Media:vo wylq103 13 kazuha 06.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I understand. Perhaps this is a flaw in my personality... I've always been captivated by grand aspirations.
Media:vo wylq103 13 kazuha 07.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Hearing his wish to rival the divine light touched something inside of me, just as the sight of those who fought to repeal the Vision Hunt Decree did...
Media:vo wylq103 13 kazuha 08.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Your quest to face the gods and trace your sibling inspires me in the same way.
Media:vo wylq103 13 kazuha 09.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: After everything I've seen, perhaps these pursuits fascinate me a little more than they should.
Media:vo wylq103 13 kazuha 10.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I will continue to support you from this point on. Know that you will have my assistance whenever you need it.
Media:vo wylq103 13 kazuha 11.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Oh, you're right. We need to tell him about the findings of our investigation.
Media:vo wylq103 13 kazuha 12.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: And it's also time to give him a response to the offer he made me.
Media:vo wylq103 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So that's why he said it had to be done in that order...
Media:vo wylq103 13 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: His consciousness will disappear forever after fulfilling the bladesmith's wish.
Media:vo wylq103 13 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Seems like he really, really wanted to fulfill his maker's wish...
Media:vo wylq103 13 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, Kazuha...
Media:vo wylq103 13 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Wait, shouldn't we also go update Kujou Kamaji?
Media:vo wylq103 14 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Then we needn't recount all the details again. Now, as to your earlier offer, I wish to give you my answer... please take a look at this blade.
Media:vo wylq103 14 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: "Kagotsurube Isshin," a weapon crafted using a long-lost blade forging art of the Kaedehara Clan.
Media:vo wylq103 14 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: By means of a series of fortuitous events, I was able to recover and restore him. I also promised him that I will continue to study and pass on the secrets of Isshin Art.
Media:vo wylq103 14 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: And so, it looks like I will likely continue with my journey across the nations, learning more about this blade as I go.
Media:vo wylq103 14 kazuha 05.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: The Kaedehara Clan has always been a family of bladesmiths, so it is only proper for me to continue on this path.
Media:vo wylq103 14 kazuha 06.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Were I to accept your goodwill, I may find myself embroiled in conflicts between the Shogunate and Sangonomiya. That would not suit me.
Media:vo wylq103 14 kazuha 07.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I am aware, but I still desire to continue walking my own path.
Media:vo wylq103 14 kazuha 08.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Great, thank you for your generosity.
Media:vo wylq103 14 kazuha 09.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm... I'll probably take to the seas with Captain Beidou again for now.
Media:vo wylq103 14 kazuha 10.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: As for my next destination...
Media:vo wylq103 14 kazuha 11.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Let's see where the wind takes me.
(Quest ends)
Media:vo wylq103 14 kujoukamaji 01.ogg Kujou Kamaji: You have returned! I hear that the issue has been resolved. Though this was a treacherous investigation indeed, we are most fortunate that no lives were lost.
Media:vo wylq103 14 kujoukamaji 02.ogg Kujou Kamaji: The Tenryou Commission has already attended to the danger at the warehouse. The investigation into Amenoma Yuuya should conclude soon, I do not believe he will be charged with any crime.
Media:vo wylq103 14 kujoukamaji 03.ogg Kujou Kamaji: What's this?
Media:vo wylq103 14 kujoukamaji 04.ogg Kujou Kamaji: I see... I understand.
Media:vo wylq103 14 kujoukamaji 05.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Ah, you misunderstand, that was most certainly not our intent...
Media:vo wylq103 14 kujoukamaji 06.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Very well. I can understand. Then let's pretend this offer was never raised.
Media:vo wylq103 14 kujoukamaji 07.ogg Kujou Kamaji: However, if you should ever change your mind, or find yourself in need of the Shogunate's assistance, please do not hesitate to inform me.
Media:vo wylq103 14 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow, you sure kept your ear to the ground.
Media:vo wylq103 14 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Where will you travel to next, Kazuha?
Media:vo wylq103 2 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I am alright. The blade is performing largely as I expected. Having gone so long without proper use and maintenance, it's become very difficult to use.
Media:vo wylq103 2 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Though he's making every effort to persevere, I do not think he can last much longer.
Media:vo wylq103 2 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm...
Media:vo wylq103 2 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: How strange. Rather than trying to control me, he is instead trying to match my fighting rhythm.
Media:vo wylq103 2 kazuha 05.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Let's keep going.
Media:vo wylq103 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: How are you feeling? You okay?
Media:vo wylq103 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Something else on your mind?
Media:vo wylq103 3 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I can sense that his strength is slowly fading away. The blade is becoming more and more difficult for me to wield.
Media:vo wylq103 3 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: He cannot hold out much longer. If he keeps persisting, he will likely break apart at any moment.
Media:vo wylq103 3 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I will be careful with it. He also says he does not have any plans to give up easily.
Media:vo wylq103 3 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: He's still trying to achieve his goal...
Media:vo wylq103 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa, something's up with the blade!
Media:vo wylq103 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: But... what would that do to Amenoma Yuuya...
Media:vo wylq103 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Look out, ambush!
Media:vo wylq103 5 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: My apologies... in the end, I still needed your help.
Media:vo wylq103 5 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes. And it looks like he's reached his limit.
Media:vo wylq103 5 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Perhaps this time, we'll finally have a chance to see his true form.
Media:vo wylq103 5 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: If you choose to continue in the state you're in, you wouldn't even be able to beat samurai and kairagi, much less the Almighty Shogun.
Media:vo wylq103 5 kazuha 05.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Maybe you truly did wield the power to rival the Shogun's light when first forged. But the long journey from Snezhnaya back to Inazuma has left you battered and broken.
Media:vo wylq103 5 kazuha 06.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: It barely needs stating anymore. Your ambition is a flight of fancy.
Media:vo wylq103 5 kazuha 07.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I've finally figured out why it was that you agreed to my bet.
Media:vo wylq103 5 kazuha 08.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: You wanted to reach a state of harmony with me. For perhaps then, you would still be able to wield commendable power.
Media:vo wylq103 5 kazuha 09.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: But regrettably, we are nothing alike. I will never understand your obstinacy and cruelty, nor can I empathize with the one who made you.
Media:vo wylq103 5 kazuha 10.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: The only one who truly understood you had already passed away by the time you were born.
Media:vo wylq103 5 kazuha 11.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Don't worry, I'll use my own blade.
Media:vo wylq103 5 kazuha 12.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: It's just more of the same.
Media:vo wylq103 5 murayama 01.ogg Murayama: There they are. Take them down!
Media:vo wylq103 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: That was such a close call...
Media:vo wylq103 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Are you okay? It looked like you were really struggling the entire fight.
Media:vo wylq103 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: The sheen's grown a bit dimmer again. It doesn't look anywhere near as impressive as it did at the start.
Media:vo wylq103 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: True form? What are you talking about... Huh? What the...!?
Media:vo wylq103 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Is this the same blade as before!? It looks like a piece of junk!
Media:vo wylq103 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Huh? What's that supposed to mean?
Media:vo wylq103 5 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Ah! Where do they keep coming from!
Media:vo wylq103 5 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Yup yup, we can help this time!
Media:vo wylq103 6 kagotsurubeisshin 01.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: ...You are a true Kaedehara, in flesh and in spirit. Though we fought briefly together, you have seen me for who I really am.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kagotsurubeisshin 02.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: No one knew anything of my story throughout my travels, nor did I tell it to anyone. You are the first person to know the truth.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kagotsurubeisshin 03.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: I thought that if I could achieve Isshin harmony with you, perhaps there would still be a ray of hope for me.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kagotsurubeisshin 04.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Indeed. No matter how hard I tried, I could not attain that perfect harmony that your personal blade does with you.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kagotsurubeisshin 05.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Too much time has passed... My physical state is poor, and without proper maintenance, I can only disguise my true appearance behind an outer sheen.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kagotsurubeisshin 06.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Yours is the blade that took on the Musou no Hitotachi... And what a magnificent blade it is. Perhaps I shall never reach that level of glory...
Media:vo wylq103 6 kagotsurubeisshin 07.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Wh—What?
Media:vo wylq103 6 kagotsurubeisshin 08.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: ...
Media:vo wylq103 6 kagotsurubeisshin 09.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: I sensed it, but I couldn't change it. It is an integral part of my consciousness.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kagotsurubeisshin 10.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: He gave me everything... my life, my form, my consciousness and purpose...
Media:vo wylq103 6 kagotsurubeisshin 11.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: How could I possibly deny him his wish...
Media:vo wylq103 6 kagotsurubeisshin 12.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: I said to him, "Do not worry. From here on, I shall forge your legacy."
Media:vo wylq103 6 kagotsurubeisshin 13.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: How could I go back on my word...
Media:vo wylq103 6 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: But in this, too, you have failed.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Actually... this is just a generic blade that I picked up during my travels in Liyue.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Forging and maintenance are both important for a blade, but they are not everything.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: This blade has traveled the land with me for many years, and we have formed a close bond during that time. Plus, in the moment that I most needed it, I received aid from another power...
Media:vo wylq103 6 kazuha 05.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Skill, blade, determination, and desire — all these must be aligned in the practice of Isshin Art.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kazuha 06.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: There is something else I must tell you. Though your maker may not have been aware, your ability to possess your own consciousness derived from the power of the Tatarigami.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kazuha 07.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Tatarigami is a malevolence from the ancient past. It is the source of your mania and savagery.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kazuha 08.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Though you tried to cooperate with me while I was wielding you, the part of you driven by Tatarigami was constantly trying to seize control of my body.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kazuha 09.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I resisted its temptations because I wanted to save Amenoma Yuuya. But I do not know whether you yourself have any intention of trying to fight it.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kazuha 10.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I feel a great sense of regret for you, since you embarked on a journey bound for a destination you were destined never to reach.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kazuha 11.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: The moment you embarked on this journey, you lost the only person who could have ever unleashed your true potential. And yet there was no way for you to turn your back on his ambition.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kazuha 12.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: You have known this for a long time. It is the true source of your despair.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kazuha 13.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I believe our bet is now settled. I have nothing further to say.
Media:vo wylq103 6 kazuha 14.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: He now has neither the ability, nor the motivation to cause further harm. Let's give him some time to reflect on things.
Media:vo wylq103 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: You fought way better with your own sword.
Media:vo wylq103 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Aw...
Media:vo wylq103 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Where are you going, Kazuha?
Media:vo wylq103 8 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: When I touched the hilt for the first time, it's as if I was transported to a strange dimension. It was somewhere I've never been.
Media:vo wylq103 8 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: A bladesmith lay quietly on the bed, his frail face barely visible under the moonlight. His breaths were weak, and his life near its end.
Media:vo wylq103 8 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: A newly forged blade lay by his side, listening attentively to his final words.
Media:vo wylq103 8 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Indeed. While in exile in Snezhnaya, the bladesmith eventually learned the truth behind everything that had happened. The Isshin Art had been dealt a devastating blow by the desertion of its best smiths.
Media:vo wylq103 8 kazuha 05.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: He spent the rest of his life in the forge, not to vent his frustration and hatred, but to atone for his actions.
Media:vo wylq103 8 kazuha 06.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: He felt intense regret at being tricked by the Fatui, but he could never again return to his homeland. His sole wish was to one day return his single proudest creation back to the land of his birth.
Media:vo wylq103 8 kazuha 07.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: So he instructed this sentient blade to find a way back to Inazuma, no matter how long or how hard the journey. But he never wished to rival the gods...
Media:vo wylq103 8 kazuha 08.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: All he wanted to show was that they once shone brilliantly as blade and smith, that they were still worthy of being trusted.
Media:vo wylq103 8 kazuha 09.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Right. I believe the bladesmith might never have known that the power he worked with was that of the Tatarigami. The hatred within that power is what sent the blade down its ill-fated path.
Media:vo wylq103 8 kazuha 10.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: This blade has committed unforgivable atrocities, but only because it lost its original master. No one was there to correct its errors when it was losing its way.
Media:vo wylq103 8 kazuha 11.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, it is too late.
Media:vo wylq103 8 kazuha 12.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Time would not wait or stop because of his determination. While the world moved on, his ambition remained stubbornly stuck at that fleeting moment at the dawn of his journey.
Media:vo wylq103 8 kazuha 13.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: He seems to have calmed down though. Let's go and check in.
Media:vo wylq103 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow... that was the blade's memory, wasn't it?
Media:vo wylq103 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So that's the true story...
Media:vo wylq103 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: But after that, the blacksmith's intentions were warped by the Tatarigami, slowly turning his proud creation into the cursed blade of today.
Media:vo wylq103 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: *sigh* Shame it's too late now.
Media:vo wylq103 9 amenomayuuya 01.ogg Amenoma Yuuya: I see. He used my body... to inflict harm on others.
Media:vo wylq103 9 amenomayuuya 02.ogg Amenoma Yuuya: I utterly despise him and his actions, but since he stayed true to your agreement by releasing me, he must still have some remaining semblance of honor.
Media:vo wylq103 9 amenomayuuya 03.ogg Amenoma Yuuya: If a duel can help to set this state of affairs in order, I am willing to put myself forward.
Media:vo wylq103 9 amenomayuuya 04.ogg Amenoma Yuuya: I do not wish to be a mere victim in this story.
Media:vo wylq103 9 amenomayuuya 05.ogg Amenoma Yuuya: Thanks for your help. Who knows how this would have ended without your intervention.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 01.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: When I look back at the past, I can remember the day of my forging like it was just yesterday.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 02.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: I once told him that I would pay any price to fulfill his wishes, such was the debt I owed to him for giving me the gift of consciousness.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 03.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: But darkness and slaughter numb the mind. Over time, I lost sight of the difference between gratitude and grudge.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 04.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Not only did I fail to fulfill his ambition... I also defiled it...
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 05.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Since we agreed to the terms of the bet, I will honor the agreement, and release Amenoma Yuuya.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 06.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: But I still cannot bring myself to forsake his ambition. It is the entire purpose for my existence.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 07.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: So, may I ask you to help me fulfill the ambitions of myself and my creator?
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 08.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: It has to be done in this order. At least hear what I have to say... and if you don't agree, I will still release Amenoma Yuuya as promised.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 09.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: My physical form, as well as the knowledge I possess, should still be of some value to you.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 10.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Thank you all. When I was first forged, my maker was already terminally ill. He told me that he had wanted me to have the grandest opening battle.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 11.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Alas, after that, he never rose from his sickbed again...
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 12.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Nor have I ever had the chance to prove myself in battle since.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 13.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: My fights were devoid of any noble meaning. They were merely the next step in my never-ending journey... the next in a long line of transgressions.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 14.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: You are a fine warrior. I would like to request your hand in battle, and experience a true duel between samurai.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 15.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: I will release Amenoma Yuuya, and restore his consciousness. Perhaps after that, you can convince him to commit to a fight with you.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kagotsurubeisshin 16.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: He must have plenty of reasons to both hate me and desire a good fight.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: You are finally seeing reality clearly.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Let's hear it.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Oh, and who would be the opponent?
Media:vo wylq103 9 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Understood. Then let's start by waking him up and seeing if he has the stamina and will to fight.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kazuha 05.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Alright, then let's move on.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kazuha 06.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: More ronin could appear at any moment. We can't stay here.
Media:vo wylq103 9 kazuha 07.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: In any case, for a final duel, I think we should aim for a greater sense of ceremony.
Media:vo wylq103 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, now you're adding yours into the mix, too? Geez, don't push your luck mister!
Media:vo wylq103 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: His attitude has grown a lot milder...
Media:vo wylq103 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What do you think, Kazuha? Should we give him a chance?
Media:vo wylq103 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: There's no need to worry, we'll vouch for your innocence to the Tenryou Commission!
Media:vo wylq103 cs kagotsurubeisshin 01.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: My power is almost spent. Without him, my eventual demise is inevitable
Media:vo wylq103 cs kagotsurubeisshin 02.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: But if I abandon the future to give everything I have in this moment, my physical form can be forged anew
Media:vo wylq103 cs kagotsurubeisshin 03.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Yes, the cost is my entire consciousness
(The Prized Isshin Blade, as Kazuha, awakes in the real world and begins to reforge the sword)
Media:vo wylq103 cs kagotsurubeisshin 04.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: You were right, there's nothing that I can accomplish now
Media:vo wylq103 cs kagotsurubeisshin 05.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: But there's still a chance for Isshin Art
Media:vo wylq103 cs kagotsurubeisshin 06.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Once remade, I will be a valuable resource for your studies
Media:vo wylq103 cs kagotsurubeisshin 07.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Isshin lives on, and its finest hour is yet to come
Media:vo wylq103 cs kagotsurubeisshin 08.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Even if I am not the one to prove its might to the Shogun...
Media:vo wylq103 cs kagotsurubeisshin 09.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: As long as it is an Isshin blade, crafted by Kaedehara hands...
Media:vo wylq103 cs kagotsurubeisshin 10.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: It will still fulfill his final wish
(In the realm of consciousness)
Media:vo wylq103 cs kagotsurubeisshin 11.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Thank you, son of the Kaedehara Clan
Media:vo wylq103 cs kagotsurubeisshin 12.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: Over the years, my real name has been forgotten by all. I'm ashamed to utter it, yet it remains strong in my mind:
Media:vo wylq103 cs kagotsurubeisshin 13.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: "Kagotsurube Isshin"
Media:vo wylq103 cs kagotsurubeisshin 14.ogg Prized Isshin Blade: This name is now yours to keep...
(The purple glow in Kazuha's eyes fades away)
Media:vo wylq103 cs kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: "Everything"... you mean...?
Media:vo wylq103 cs kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Hm
Media:vo wylq103 cs kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Rest in peace
(Cinematic ends)
The illusion disperses, revealing the true form of this sword at last...
