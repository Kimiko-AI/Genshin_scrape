 Let's get closer to them at least.
 Quest DescriptionAfter arriving on Seirai island  [sic], you meet two adventurers who are currently investigating something known as a Warding Stone. But following the footprints of a cat, you arrive at a dilapidated shrine, in which sits a cat named "Neko," who proclaims itself to be the "provisional head priestess of the Asase Shrine." After you help "Neko" repair the shrine's Offering Box, it reveals the method of sealing the Warding Stones to you. Additionally, you learn that should you be able to seal all four Warding Stones throughout Seirai Island, you can calm the thunderstorm that enshrouds it.
 Then we'd best be off.
 Yup, let's go.
Eiko: That's the second Warding Stone sealed. Only two left.
Eiko: The storm and these Warding Stones... We'll have to write a pretty detailed report for the Guild later...
Eiko: Well, it is our only lead concerning the storm...
Eiko: Whatever the case may be, let's just have a look at those Warding Stones first.
Paimon: Eh? Why are there only two paper charm hangers here? What happened to the last one?
Paimon: Huh. Why are these still so many bandits? C'mon, we can't let them destroy that Warding Stone. Let's get 'em!
Paimon: The sealing process should be the same as what we did the first time. Let's figure out where to hand those pieces of paper first...
Paimon: This must be one of the three remaining Warding Stones.
Paimon: Ugh, guess we need to have a look around.
Paimon: Well, that should do it. Let's go seal that Warding Stone.
Taisuke: As long as we seal all the Warding Stones, that should calm the storm.
Taisuke: I sure hope that what this "Neko" says is true...
Taisuke: Let's look at remaining [sic] two Warding Stones.
