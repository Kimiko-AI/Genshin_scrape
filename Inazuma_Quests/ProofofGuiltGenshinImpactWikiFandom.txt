 A distraction, you say...
 I have no idea what I'm looking for.
 I'm not sure...
 It's not been quite that long...
 Quest DescriptionYou hurry to find proof of your claims to Kujou Sara that the Kujou Clan has betrayed the Shogunate within three days.
 The Yashiro Commission!
 We lit the firework and ran away...
 We'll just have to trust Yoimiya.
 We've done this before...
 What exactly is the evidence?
After some time...
Media:vo dialog dqaq105 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Fireworks are more visible at night... If possible, I suggest you wait till after dark to put your plan into action.
Media:vo dialog dqaq105 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: That Guuji Yae... she's such an enigma.
Media:vo dialog dqaq105 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: *sigh* I really hope the plan works out...
Media:vo dialog dqaq105 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Mind yourself against the Raiden Shogun!
Media:vo dialog dqaq105 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: Hmm? Is there anything else you want?
Media:vo dqaq009 1 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Yikes! Hide — quick!
Media:vo dqaq009 1 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Oh no — run!
Media:vo dqaq009 1 soldier 01.ogg Patrol Officer: Stop! I have orders to search for a wanted criminal!
Media:vo dqaq009 1 soldier 02.ogg Patrol Officer: You! The warrant is for your arrest! Freeze!
Media:vo dqaq105 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ah! That toy tanuki just turned into a human!
Media:vo dqaq105 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What's going on? Paimon's never seen one of these before!
Media:vo dqaq105 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Um, is this the "professional" you were talking about?
Media:vo dqaq105 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Heh... She doesn't look very professional at all.
Media:vo dqaq105 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Wow, a ninja! So was that one of those legendary ninja transformation techniques?
Media:vo dqaq105 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Anyway, what's the Shuumatsuban?
Media:vo dqaq105 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: You make it sound so simple, but...
Media:vo dqaq105 1 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Not a tanuki... I'm a mujina... *snore*...
Media:vo dqaq105 1 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: I'm so tired... If I don't get enough sleep... it'll stunt my growth...
Media:vo dqaq105 1 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Ah...
Media:vo dqaq105 1 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe... She is a member of the Shuumatsuban, a genuine, bona-fide ninja.
Media:vo dqaq105 1 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: It belongs to the Yashiro Commission. A secret unit under Kamisato Ayato.
Media:vo dqaq105 1 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: Now, Kamisato Ayato and the Yashiro Commission are neutral parties, so I have no right to give orders to the Shuumatsuban.
Media:vo dqaq105 1 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: However, convincing their most chronically lazy member to help us is well within my abilities.
Media:vo dqaq105 1 yaemiko 05.ogg Yae Miko: Here's what I need you to do: Go into town and find evidence of the Tenryou Commission's betrayal.
Media:vo dqaq105 1 yaemiko 06.ogg Yae Miko: It would not be appropriate for me to be seen there myself.
Media:vo dqaq105 1 yaemiko 07.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm? Oh, I thought you would have figured it out by now. Alright then, I'll indulge you with a little more information.
Media:vo dqaq105 1 yaemiko 08.ogg Yae Miko: For a complete outsider, probing the inner workings of the Tenryou Commission is nigh on impossible.
Media:vo dqaq105 1 yaemiko 09.ogg Yae Miko: But since the three Commissions work together to serve the Shogun, they have a close relationship. Someone from one of the other Commissions might have an easier job of figuring out what they're up to...
Media:vo dqaq105 1 yaemiko 10.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe... Now you're following me.
Media:vo dqaq105 1 yaemiko 11.ogg Yae Miko: The Shogun's Army haven't given up on their search for you yet, but with the help of this Shuumatsuban ninja, I'm sure you'll be able to rendezvous with your friends.
Media:vo dqaq105 1 yaemiko 12.ogg Yae Miko: Don't forget we're on a tight schedule here. Be sure to bring back the evidence in good time.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I see. You have been through a lot since we last met.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I understand, you need evidence of the Tenryou Commission's betrayal. Let me think...
Media:vo dqaq105 2 ayaka 03.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Now that you mention it, there is one thing that has always concerned me. The Shogun's Army has been at war with the resistance for a long time now, but not once has the Shogun ever inquired about it.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 ayaka 04.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I used to think that she simply didn't care, but looking at it now, perhaps the problem all along has been with the Tenryou Commission's reports to the Shogun.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 ayaka 05.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: The Tenryou Commission presides over domestic military affairs. If they ever had any intention of concealing information in their reports, we would have no way of knowing.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 ayaka 06.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Meanwhile, the Shogun would incorrectly conclude that the Vision Hunt Decree poses no threat, and would stick to her decision. If we had access to their reports, it would confirm everything.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 ayaka 07.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: If only there was a way we could distract the guards just for long enough.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 ayaka 08.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Hmm...
Media:vo dqaq105 2 ayaka 09.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: That's a very Thoma-sounding suggestion...
Media:vo dqaq105 2 ayaka 10.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: But it's a reasonable one. The Statue of the Omnipresent God is right by the Tenryou Commission. If someone set off fireworks near the statue, they certainly wouldn't ignore it.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 ayaka 11.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: While they were preoccupied with that, Sayu could infiltrate the Tenryou Commission and take the report, as well as any other evidence she might find...
Media:vo dqaq105 2 ayaka 12.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Let's focus on the issue at hand. The sooner the Vision Hunt Decree is abolished, the sooner Thoma will be free.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 ayaka 13.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: This was a reunion of sorts, but there's no time to catch up. We'll celebrate properly when it's all over.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 ayaka 14.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: The Tenryou Commission is heavily guarded. Be careful when you get near. Let's meet back here afterwards.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Thoma! Thoma, you there?
Media:vo dqaq105 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's us, we're back!
Media:vo dqaq105 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Not just yet... We saw people patrolling on our way here.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: What do you mean?
Media:vo dqaq105 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Poor Thoma...
Media:vo dqaq105 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: You're still thinking about that!?
Media:vo dqaq105 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Alright, (Traveler). First, let's go to Hanamizaka to find Yoimiya.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: (Traveler), what brings you here?
Media:vo dqaq105 2 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Did you meet with the resistance? How's the battle going? Is it safe for me to come out yet?
Media:vo dqaq105 2 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: So it's still not over... I guess you came here because you have something to discuss?
Media:vo dqaq105 2 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: I'll get someone to call for Miss Kamisato, bear with me for one second.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: But as I recall, the only person authorized to access that kind of official documentation is Kujou Takayuki.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: It's heavily guarded too. Even with Sayu's help, swiping a document from under their noses is no easy task.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: Yoimiya's fireworks!
Media:vo dqaq105 2 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Great! It feels like I'm getting closer and closer to being a free man again.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: Ah... It feels like it's been an eternity since we last sat down and talked like this.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: Well, it certainly felt like it to me... I've been looking forward to seeing you again every day since I got here!
Media:vo dqaq105 2 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: This teahouse used to be my favorite hiding place, but now... I've honestly lost track of how long it's been since I last set foot outside of here.
Media:vo dqaq105 2 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: Oh, man! I want to go to the hot springs so badly!
Media:vo dqaq105 2 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: Oh, let's play the hot pot game again!
Media:vo dqaq105 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yoimiya, we need an extra-large firework! The super, duper big kind!
Media:vo dqaq105 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Eh, why does Paimon feel so nervous all of a sudden...
Media:vo dqaq105 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We'll give it a try... Thanks, Yoimiya.
Media:vo dqaq105 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Well, we've got our distraction. Now we just need to wait for nightfall.
Media:vo dqaq105 3 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: "Extra-large firework"?
Media:vo dqaq105 3 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: Hee-hee, you sure came to the right person.
Media:vo dqaq105 3 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: As it happens, I made this really souped-up one just a couple days ago.
Media:vo dqaq105 3 yoimiya 04.ogg Yoimiya: But it's so powerful that I haven't found anywhere I can test it out yet... may as well give it to you. Let me know how it turns out.
Media:vo dqaq105 3 yoimiya 05.ogg Yoimiya: Don't forget, move well away from it after you light the fuse, and try to avoid burning your clothes. Also, it's best that you cover your ears...
Media:vo dqaq105 3 yoimiya 06.ogg Yoimiya: Hahaha, don't worry, it's just a firework, come on. What's the worst that could happen!
Media:vo dqaq105 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Is this really a good idea...?
Media:vo dqaq105 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh, a—anyway, let's make our way to the statue! Careful does it, watch out for guards and don't get caught!
Media:vo dqaq105 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What kind of firework is this!? By the look of it, Paimon's ears are gonna get blown off!
Media:vo dqaq105 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, Yoimiya... you are officially nuts...
Media:vo dqaq105 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh, they're all coming this way! (Traveler), quick, run!
Media:vo dqaq105 4 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Hmm... Pretty much how I thought...
Media:vo dqaq105 4 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: There are loads and loads of people... If one of them spots me, I'll get caught...
Media:vo dqaq105 4 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: We need to get rid of them, or I won't be able to sneak inside...
Media:vo dqaq105 4 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: After I get the document, let's meet back at Komore Teahouse, okay?
Media:vo dqaq105 4 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: Also, if I do get caught... please come rescue me...
Media:vo dqaq105 5 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Well, (Traveler)? How did it go?
Media:vo dqaq105 5 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Well done. Let's wait for news from Sayu.
Media:vo dqaq105 5 ayaka 03.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: This sealed envelope must be an official report that the Tenryou Commission is preparing to present to the Shogun.
Media:vo dqaq105 5 ayaka 04.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: In addition, we have... correspondence with the Fatui.
Media:vo dqaq105 5 ayaka 05.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: It seems that Guuji Yae was right. They have been fomenting unrest behind the scenes.
Media:vo dqaq105 5 ayaka 06.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: (Traveler), this should be ample evidence. Please take them to Guuji Yae. I trust she will have a plan for the next step.
Media:vo dqaq105 5 ayaka 07.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I will also gather some people to try and root out the rest of the Fatui in Inazuma.
Media:vo dqaq105 5 ayaka 08.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Again, we'll just have to trust Guuji Yae. She is close to the Shogun, so maybe she will have a way...
Media:vo dqaq105 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: If Paimon remembers correctly, it should be time for our meeting with Yae Miko soon.
Media:vo dqaq105 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's pack up our things and get ready to head to the Grand Narukami Shrine.
Media:vo dqaq105 5 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: *panting*...
Media:vo dqaq105 5 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: I know exercise helps you grow, but this was a little too much exercise...
Media:vo dqaq105 5 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: I feel so dizzy... Everyone is spinning...
Media:vo dqaq105 5 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: No, I can't sleep yet. There was something important I was supposed to do first... Oh, right, yeah. I got it!
Media:vo dqaq105 5 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: I didn't know how to find the document you guys were talking about, so I just swiped a whole bunch of stuff that looked suspicious.
Media:vo dqaq105 5 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Here you go... I'm going to sleep now...
Media:vo dqaq105 5 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Milady, what are we looking at?
Media:vo dqaq105 5 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Still, mind yourself when you face the Shogun. I still get goosebumps just thinking about her drawing that blade...
You inform Ayaka and Thoma of the current situation...
