 Glad I could help.
Katheryne: Mm-hmm. The observational reports you gathered were very important indeed.
 Quest DescriptionAfter a period of investigation, the Adventurers' Guild has eliminated the possible threats that the Specter incident may have caused, and they have also collected a lot of related information. This information has already been handed over to professional researchers, and it seems likely that they will soon make some further progress.
 Some extra rewards would make for a nice thank-you.
Katheryne: Haha, no problem. In that case, be sure to take part in future commissions as well.
Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! The Adventurers' Guild thanks you for your services!
Katheryne: Ah, and yes, please don't forget to claim your rewards from the Guild!
Katheryne: Haha, no problem. In that case, be sure to take part in future commissions as well.
Katheryne: I believe that you need not worry about Specters threatening the ordinary people going forward. I will organize the intelligence we've gathered and submit them to professional researchers for study.
Katheryne: Mm-hmm. The observational reports you gathered were very important indeed.
Katheryne: Thanks for your efforts thus far, Adventurer. We have been able to gather sufficient data concerning these Specters.
