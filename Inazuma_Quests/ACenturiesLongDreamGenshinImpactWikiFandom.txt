 "1, 2, 3"...
 "3, 2, 1"...
 Aaaah, please, someone, anyone!
 Help me write chapter four!
 Hold on, are we...
 I just couldn't get in on the conversation myself.
 I remember everything pretty clearly.
 My paycheck!!!
 Quest DescriptionThe light novel is a great hit. It has successfully outshone "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits." Now, it is time to catch the spirit behind it.
 Step DescriptionYae Miko plans on using a summoning ritual to bring forth the author of "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits." Complete the ritual together with her.
 Surely you're not planning to...
 They want to do a "Hyakkiyakou"?
 What do I need to do?
 You mean the "moonless night"?
Media:vo ymlq003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Miko, what is this place?
Media:vo ymlq003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Really? But it feels so eerie here...
Media:vo ymlq003 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Paimon's heart is pounding, but Paimon's pretty sure it's not because of excitement!
Media:vo ymlq003 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hey! Wait up!
Media:vo ymlq003 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: *whimpering* Paimon's scared... (Traveler), stay close by, okay? Don't leave Paimon all alone...
Media:vo ymlq003 1 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: The ideal spot for a little meet-and-greet with a certain elusive author. This is the place where we are most likely to succeed in summoning the spirit.
Media:vo ymlq003 1 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, that seems rather fitting, considering that we are dealing with the spirits of the deceased here.
Media:vo ymlq003 1 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: What are you so afraid of, honestly? We're finally about to meet the true author of "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits." Aren't you excited?
Media:vo ymlq003 1 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: Hahaha. Come on, in we go.
Media:vo ymlq003 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What a weird painting... Miko, do you know what it's supposed to show?
Media:vo ymlq003 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's a good piece of artwork and all, but it's also kinda eerie... so it's a bit scary.
Media:vo ymlq003 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Looks like the artist signed their name... Umm... "Rakusai"? Hmm, it's not very clear.
Media:vo ymlq003 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wow, this place is huge! Hey, is that... a mirror?
Media:vo ymlq003 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: There's a really weird-looking stool as well. Wonder what it's for?
Media:vo ymlq003 2 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... Probably a scene from ancient Inazuma.
Media:vo ymlq003 2 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: Let's go inside and take a look.
Media:vo ymlq003 2 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: Ah, I see. Heh, this setup is quite handy. Saves me a lot of work.
Media:vo ymlq003 2 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: Alright, go and take a look around. There should be a mechanism somewhere that makes the whole room move.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa, it's that painting we just saw! It's turning this way, along with the whole wall!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 02a.ogg Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 02b.ogg Paimon: Are we positive that summoning a spirit to possess (Traveler) isn't gonna have any lasting negative consequences?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 03a.ogg Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: It's like (Traveler)'s sitting inside the painting.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh!? Is Paimon seeing things? Did the painting just move!?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Umm... probably something to do with writing?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: The painting is moving again! What the—
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: We got you! So, you were the one who wrote "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits"!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: What are you trying to do, hmm? Why'd you put that summoning incantation in the book, huh? What's your game here?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: What!? Paimon knew it! You had an evil plan all along!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Wake up, (Traveler)! Quick, wake up! We gotta stop him!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Hey! Come on, wake up! Don't let him take your mind!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Miko! Think of something! Miko! Miko!!!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: ...Um...
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: You're laughing!?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Urakusai? Miko, you guys know each other?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Memory? But... isn't he a spirit?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: So that's how it happened... But why did you include a summoning incantation in the novel?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Uh, but... but...
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: Alright then... You've finally convinced Paimon, you guys were right.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: He disappeared...
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 21.ogg Paimon: Are you awake, (Traveler)? How are you feeling?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 22.ogg Paimon: You cannot be serious, Miko! After all that, you still have more errands for us?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 23.ogg Paimon: Hmph, you guys teamed up to scare Paimon just now. If you think Paimon's gonna do anything you ask for, think again!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 24.ogg Paimon: Paimon's paycheck!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 25.ogg Paimon: Ugh, well there's no way out now... We're in too deep.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 paimon 26.ogg Paimon: It's getting eerier and scarier! Wh—What is this place!?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 01.ogg ???: ...
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 02.ogg ???: Haw-haw... I never thought the day would come when I'd be summoned using my own ritual! Getting a taste of my own medicine...
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 03.ogg ???: What have we here? Another budding writer? What's come over you all, why is everyone wishing for help with their writing? Are novels so popular in this day and age?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 04.ogg ???: Huh? What's this?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 05.ogg ???: Oh, ho-ho, I see... No wonder this felt so familiar. I've walked right into your trap, haven't I.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 06.ogg ???: You ask me what my game is here? Well of course... it was to use this incantation as a means for all the souls of the departed youkai to make their glorious return to the world and plunge all of Inazuma into a brutal, bloody war!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 07.ogg ???: Oh, did you now? Then how naive of you to let me possess this body so easily!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 08.ogg Urakusai: But with this incantation, they can go one last little joyride in the world for a couple of days. Anything they're still itching to do, they can go and get it done!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 08a.ogg Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 08b.ogg ???: I sense... Yes, great power within (him/her)...
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 09.ogg ???: Good... good! With this power, no one shall be able to stand in my way!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 10.ogg ???: Mwuhahahahahaha!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 11a.ogg Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 11b.ogg ???: It is futile... you shall never wake (him/her) again! This body now belongs to me!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 12.ogg ???: Hahahaha...
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 13.ogg Urakusai: Haw-haw, well, you made the face enough times that I couldn't exactly miss the hint. This is what you were going for, yes? Never one to stand on the sidelines of a good spectacle, are you? Always got to dive in and fan the flames... Ah, you mischievous little kitsune, you...
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 14.ogg Urakusai: Look what you've done to this little flying one here. Aw, poor thing's scared witless.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 15.ogg Urakusai: Yes, we do! Of course we do.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 16.ogg Urakusai: Ah, spirits, memories... they're just different words to describe the same thing. Something that comes from the Ley Lines.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 17.ogg Urakusai: Indeed, indeed. I was wandering around the Sacred Sakura's roots, when I suddenly heard someone yelling "Please, someone, anyone! Help me write a truly amazing novel!"
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 18.ogg Urakusai: It piqued my curiosity, so I popped inside his body and wrote a novel for him.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 19.ogg Urakusai: Oh, little one... not to toot my own horn here, but when I was alive, I wasn't just another kitsune, no. I was a mighty and powerful Daiyouko. The memories of other youkai can't possess human bodies at will like I can.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 20.ogg Urakusai: Disturbance? Haw-haw, I guess you mean that we might leave them with some broken dreams after we leave, hmm? Oh, yes, and they might have a fever, or whatever.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 21.ogg Urakusai: But you know, I actually think that the most admirable thing about human beings is the way that they go out and shape their fate with their own two hands, given that they're not born blessed with the same powers that we enjoy.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 22.ogg Urakusai: As for those who would rather draw on external power than seek to improve themselves, it's quite right that they learn their lesson eventually.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 23.ogg Urakusai: So when you think about it, we're actually doing the humans a big favor. Miko, you agree, don't you?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 24.ogg Urakusai: What are you scared of, little one? Don't be deceived by her day-to-day antics. Miko is actually one of the most powerful youkai out there.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 25.ogg Urakusai: Hmph, of course. You were never one to make extra work for yourself where you can help it, and yet you went to all these lengths to find my painting room and even took the trouble to summon me... I knew you must have some ulterior motive!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 26.ogg Urakusai: You were always the one to pick a quarrel with me when we all used to gather around and share stories.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 27.ogg Urakusai: Alright, alright. You win, I lose. Happy now?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 28.ogg Urakusai: Mmm... I remember when you were just a little girl, always hanging off my shoulders. A few hundred years later, and you're all grown up.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 29.ogg Urakusai: Not much. That goes for all of us, actually. We've all got to go back where we came from in the end.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 30.ogg Urakusai: Everyone's quite content in many ways, but they still can't help but ask: "Are we ever going to have another Hyakkiyakou?"
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 31.ogg Urakusai: Haw-haw, great, wonderful! Fantastic!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 32.ogg Urakusai: Miko, it's been nice catching up, but I'd better conserve my energy if I want to stick it out until then. So I'll be on my way now.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 33.ogg Urakusai: One last thing, Miko... I just want to know, have you been well all these years?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 34.ogg Urakusai: Oh, well great! That's fantastic!
Media:vo ymlq003 3 urakusai 35.ogg Urakusai: Hehe, hahahaha...
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: Okay. Next, I will show you a secret kitsune spell. This painting is a "swift summoning medium," which means I'll be able to skip many of the more tedious steps.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: The murky mirror reflects the view of Inazuma in a bygone age. Spirits stirred by the sight of the past will be easily drawn to it.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: You're up next, little one. Come on, sit yourself down here.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 05.ogg Yae Miko: Yes, the whole point of a summoning ritual is for a dead person's spirit to possess a living person's body.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 06.ogg Yae Miko: You saw what happened to that oni samurai's spirit. After leaving the host's body, he was only able to maintain his form for a very short time before disappearing.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 07.ogg Yae Miko: Aw, you really care about the little one quite a lot, don't you? Hm, I'm a little jealous. I wish my friends were caring like that.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 08.ogg Yae Miko: Anyway, are you scared, little friend? Don't you worry, now, it'll be over soon. Just think of it like having a dream.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 09.ogg Yae Miko: Sit on the chair, stare at the painting, and relax your body and mind. But try and be natural, there's really no need to be nervous.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 10.ogg Yae Miko: Recite the incantation in your heart, little one. Also, you'll need to have some intense thoughts going through your head — a wish, for example.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 11.ogg Yae Miko: Now, what kind of wish do we think it would take to summon forth the author of "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits"? Anyone?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 12.ogg Yae Miko: Very good! The wish needs to be heartfelt, though, so let me help add a little realism to the equation:
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 13.ogg Yae Miko: "The book is selling exceptionally well, Traveler, but we're going to need an outline for chapter four as soon as humanly possible. When is the earliest that you can turn it in by?"
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 14.ogg Yae Miko: ...
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 15.ogg Yae Miko: Pfff...
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 16.ogg Yae Miko: Bahahahaha...
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 17.ogg Yae Miko: Ahahahahahaha, oh, Urakusai, you haven't changed a bit. You caught on so quickly. Too perfect.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 18.ogg Yae Miko: Pfft, you were having plenty of fun playing the bad guy a moment ago. Now you're trying blame it all on me?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 19.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, allow me to formally introduce the author of "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits," Urakusai.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 20.ogg Yae Miko: No, wait. To be more accurate, it's Urakusai's memory.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 21.ogg Yae Miko: Do you remember that recent incident when the rifthounds were gnawing at the Sacred Sakura's roots?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 22.ogg Yae Miko: You witnessed human memories leaking from the Ley Lines, didn't you? Well, since there are human memories, of course there are going to be youkai memories, too.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 23.ogg Yae Miko: In life, youkai possess supernatural powers, and even when they are a shadow of their former selves from a bygone era, they still have the ability to control whether they are visible or not.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 24.ogg Yae Miko: Typically, youkai memories survive longer in the world than those of humans.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 25.ogg Yae Miko: She's trying to say that all the commotion this causes is likely to be a great disturbance to the humans.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 26.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, yes, that's what I thought, too.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 27.ogg Yae Miko: Not only that, Urakusai, but my latest work has beaten that book you wrote, "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits," to become the most popular in Inazuma.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 28.ogg Yae Miko: Ha! I finally get to hear you say it, centuries later. Oh, I must say it feels good.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 29.ogg Yae Miko: Urakusai, how much time do you have left?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 30.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, don't you worry about that, Urakusai. Arrangements are being made.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 31.ogg Yae Miko: When my bell rings, it means the moonless night is upon us.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 32.ogg Yae Miko: Alright. Goodbye then, Urakusai.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 33.ogg Yae Miko: I've been great, of course. Every day is a happy one.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 34.ogg Yae Miko: Especially these days. Not only do I have my light novels, but I've also met these two delightfully nosy outlanders.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 35.ogg Yae Miko: And even Ei is finally starting to come to her senses. Quite a miracle, given how pig-headed she can be.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 36.ogg Yae Miko: Urakusai, you'd be right at home in this era.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 37.ogg Yae Miko: A great storyteller and artist like yourself would be the Yae Publishing House's ace in the hole. And I would personally be hounding you over your next installment.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 38.ogg Yae Miko: Are you all there? Here, like last time, repeat after me—
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 39.ogg Yae Miko: Oh, you beat me to it. Looks like your brain is intact.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 40.ogg Yae Miko: So, your first possession, hmm? What was it like?
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 41.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, good. Saves me from having to explain everything again.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 42.ogg Yae Miko: Hearing Urakusai admit defeat has put me in the most wonderful mood. In return, it's only fair that we make sure to deliver on what they're all hoping for.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 43.ogg Yae Miko: Yes. Though they only represent a tiny proportion of the memories in the Ley Lines, it will still be quite a sight to behold when the time comes.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 44.ogg Yae Miko: Since you've come this far, why don't you do one last thing for me, hmm? I'll need your help with the ritual.
Media:vo ymlq003 3 yaemiko 45.ogg Yae Miko: Aw, come on, I'm really only asking you to finish what you started. Besides... your paychecks are still in my hands. Heh, heh, heh.
The strange aura travels from within the painting onto you, and the scene before your eyes changes...
