Teyvat's Big Sister
Gentle and kind, she answers all your questions
She'll help you be rid of all your troubles!
 (I can't let Gorou know the full story...)
 (I wonder how Gorou would react to this...)
 (I'll just have to hide it from him for now...)
 (Let's see what this is all about...)
 (Phew, managed to keep him in the dark...)
 Haha...
 Heh, yeah...
 Hehe...
 I couldn't say...
 I heard Yae Miko is about to come back!
 I've never heard of her.
 It's a Narukami Island custom!
 It's a quirky practice of the Yae Publishing House!
 It's a special case today...
 Looks kind of familiar...
 No resemblance whatsoever!
 No, she isn't.
 No...
 Not really...
 Quest DescriptionYou were here at the Yae Publishing House to keep watch, but...
 So Ms. Hina is...
 Step DescriptionYou were here at Yae Publishing House to keep watch, but ...
 Step DescriptionYou've learned the truth behind Ms. Hina. Do you want to break this news to Gorou?
 What's this...?
 What's up, Gorou?
 Who?
 Why are you helping to write for them?
 Why don't I deliver them for you...
 You can't...
 You're imagining things!
Gentle and kind, she answers all your questions
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 55.ogg Gorou: Hmm? I thought you were going to survey the scene at Yae Publishing House?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 01.ogg Hiroshi: Well of course, it's... to tell the whole world about how wonderful Ms. Hina is!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 02.ogg Hiroshi: So what do you think?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 03.ogg Hiroshi: There is no mistaking it. Just from her letters, I can feel that she respects me, trusts me... she has a natural ability to connect with people.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 04.ogg Hiroshi: She's so considerate. She can always sense our true emotions from our letters and never fails to deliver the advice and the encouragement we need.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 05.ogg Hiroshi: Except when it comes to the topic of romantic love â€” she's clearly not an expert there. But even then, that just makes her all the more endearing to us!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 06.ogg Hiroshi: Welcome to the Ms. Hina Fan Club!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 01.ogg Nobuhiro: Alright, everyone, settle down!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 02.ogg Nobuhiro: We are gathered here today united by a common purpose! Now, who can tell me what they think that might be?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 03.ogg Nobuhiro: An excellent answer!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 04.ogg Nobuhiro: How gentle she is... how understanding she is... how delightfully mischievous she can be, on occasion...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 05.ogg Nobuhiro: We can all testify to the great joy that Ms. Hina has brought to our lives. But my friends, there are so many people out there in this world who still need Ms. Hina's salvation.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 06.ogg Nobuhiro: We can help by spreading the good news about Ms. Hina to every soul in the world!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 07a.ogg Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 07b.ogg Nobuhiro: Shhh! Calm your voice down, we don't want to scare (him/her) off!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 08.ogg Nobuhiro: Hello, my friend. On this joyous day, we would like to open our hearts to you and tell you about the existence of a perfect being.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 09.ogg Nobuhiro: She is gentle, kind, understanding... she is the brightest star in our sky. Here, have this pamphlet.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 10.ogg Nobuhiro: Oh, my apologies. In my excitement, I forgot to give you all the details.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 11.ogg Nobuhiro: Have you ever come across a magazine called "That's Life," published by the Yae Publishing House?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 12.ogg Nobuhiro: It's a monthly magazine featuring, amongst other things, an advice column. We were among the first readers to send in letters seeking advice, and we've received kind and gentle replies to each one.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 13.ogg Nobuhiro: Although the editor chose to conceal her name, gender, and other details, we all see her as an empathetic older sister figure, and feel convinced that she must be the same sort of person in real life.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 14.ogg Nobuhiro: That's right! Ms. Hina is the person in charge of "That's Life" magazine's advice column. She is the one we all admire and adore so greatly.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 15.ogg Nobuhiro: And so, when we heard that Yae Publishing House would be revealing the official likeness of Ms. Hina today, we immediately came here from wherever we were, all over the nation, to gather together...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 16.ogg Nobuhiro: ...and to witness this grand moment in history!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 17.ogg Nobuhiro: Please, gaze upon the radiant beauty of Ms. Hina, see how truly lovely she is...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 18.ogg Nobuhiro: I've been following Ms. Hina's column since the very first issue of "That's Life."
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 yuka 01.ogg Yuka: My friend... do you have a moment to talk about Ms. Hina?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 yuka 02.ogg Yuka: Friends, I found one! Someone needs our help!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 yuka 03.ogg Yuka: Recently, the column went through a low period where it just wasn't popular at all. In fact, they almost axed it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 yuka 04.ogg Yuka: Fortunately, Yae Publishing House made the decision to publicize her image, and then the column finally started to grow in popularity.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902601 yuka 05.ogg Yuka: I don't know if you know the word "fan"? A friendly adventurer lady taught it to us a few years ago. She seemed to know everything.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Oh? Hey, there you are.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Is you-know-who at Yae Publishing House?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: Phew... That's good.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: I just finished writing my replies, so I was about to head to Yae Publishing House and hand them in.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: Why...? Hmm.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: I guess it's because I can help people this way. Also, the editor said to me, "This is something that only you are capable of."
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: They made quite a solemn request when they first approached me, so I felt like I couldn't refuse it. But once I'd settled into it, I found myself really enjoying it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: Before I knew it, I had written hundreds of replies, and sometimes they'd respond again just to thank me. It made me so happy whenever they'd compliment me.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: Every time I think about that terrifying woman, I feel like I want nothing to do with Yae Publishing House. But then, whenever I think about how my replies can help so many people, I feel a sense of responsibility.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: By this point, I'm so used to it that I'd probably find it hard to adjust if I ever gave it up.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Well... I don't know quite what's going on, but I'd like to get these letters delivered quickly while you-know-who isn't around.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: I'm really looking forward to the readers' reactions when they receive my letters. In the army, people are always a little reserved when talking to me, because I'm a general.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: But those obstacles are removed when you're communicating via letters. Everyone who writes seems to treat me like that one friend who they can share anything and everything with.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: So I'm not about to let them down. Let's head over!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 15.ogg Gorou: Hmm? But Yae Publishing House isn't far from here, if I remember correctly. Let's just head there together.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 16.ogg Gorou: Besides, this way, if you-know-who does show up, we can look out for each other. Let's go!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Strange, it seems unusually lively here today.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: I don't come here often. (Traveler), is it like this most of the time?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: Hey, there seems to be some commotion over there. Let's check it out.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Oh! So this is what they call a "Fan Club."
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: I don't know whose fan club it is, but they are raring to go! Reminds me of the rallying speeches we used to give before going into battle.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: Hmm, something's up, isn't it... I can tell, you're avoiding my gaze.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: Did something happen? It's not "her," is it?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: Sorry, I'm not sure...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: Oh! Well, she sounds like a very pleasant person to be around!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: She must be the polar opposite of Yae Miko... right, (Traveler)?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Sure, that's fine.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: (Traveler), why do they want to take a picture with me?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: Alright, sure...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: That should do it... Right, I should really be heading to the Yae Publishing House to hand in those letters now.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 15.ogg Gorou: Now I'm curious too... Let's go over and take a look, (Traveler).
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 16.ogg Gorou: Hmm? Why, what's the problem?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 17.ogg Gorou: Really!? Then we can't stay, let's get out of here!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 18.ogg Gorou: As curious as I am to see what all the fuss is about... it'll have to wait until next time. So, (Traveler), please join me again the next time I'm delivering letters.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 01.ogg Hiroshi: Yes, we can!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 02.ogg Hiroshi: Excuse me, friend...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 03.ogg Hiroshi: Something about you looks awfully similar to Ms. Hina...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 04.ogg Hiroshi: I see, well, one way or another, fate has brought you here. Have you ever heard of Ms. Hina?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 05.ogg Hiroshi: Well, now's as good a time as any for you to find out more!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 06.ogg Hiroshi: Ms. Hina is gentle, kind, and considerate. You can tell her anything that is bothering you, and she will patiently advise you on how to deal with it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 07.ogg Hiroshi: Shh! Have you forgotten? We may not pry into Ms. Hina's identity!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 08.ogg Hiroshi: Ahem. Friend, may we... take a photo with you?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 09.ogg Hiroshi: We borrowed a Kamera specifically to witness the official unveiling of Ms. Hina's image today...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 10.ogg Hiroshi: Ms. Hina! Ms. Hina!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 kuroda 01.ogg Kuroda: Make way, everyone! Make way!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 kuroda 02.ogg Kuroda: The Ms. Hina billboard is here... Please, make some space, coming through!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 01.ogg Nobuhiro: Allow me to reiterate, my friends! We in the Ms. Hina Fan Club must abide by the club rules!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 02.ogg Nobuhiro: Firstly, we mustn't try and probe into Ms. Hina's true identity. We of all people cannot cause her any trouble!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 03.ogg Nobuhiro: Secondly, fans of Ms. Hina are not to make any controversial statements when representing the fan club. We must exercise self-discipline and present a good image in front of other people!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 04.ogg Nobuhiro: Thirdly, while our mission is to promote Ms. Hina in every way possible, if someone we're talking to says they're not interested, we are to respect that, and not go forcing it down their throats!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 05.ogg Nobuhiro: And finally! We are here today because Ms. Hina has brought us together. But we are also here to change ourselves for the better, for her sake! Can we do that, people? Can we do that?
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 06.ogg Nobuhiro: Hey, everybody! It's the real Ms. Hina!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 yuka 01.ogg Yuka: Always make her proud, and never bring her down!
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 yuka 02.ogg Yuka: But he's the spitting image of Ms. Hina... I wonder if they're blood relatives...
Media:vo wlcop001 1902603 yuka 03.ogg Yuka: At least let's take a photo with him...
People cluster around Gorou, and he takes a great many photos with them.
She'll help you be rid of all your troubles!
