 (We have no business disrupting the reality they are experiencing.)
 An unwavering commitment to resistance.
 Are you alright?
 But can you bear to leave humanity to go alone?
 But this cannot be the only way...
 Do you need to take a rest?
 Don't force it.
 Ei has no physical body anymore, and has to rely on the Shogun.
 Ei isn't someone who leaves herself an escape route.
 Ei!
 Everyone looks to the Shogun for hope.
 Great, thanks. I appreciate it.
 Humans are worthy of your trust.
 I think you've mentioned this before...
 It does look a lot like the Plane of Euthymia.
 Or a promise to yourself?
 Our work here isn't done.
 Quest DescriptionMany people's memories have escaped from the damaged roots of the Sacred Sakura. Raiden Ei takes the opportunity to tell you many stories about her cherished friends and the Inazuma she wants to protect.
 So full of hope.
 Step DescriptionEven as the monster incident draws to a close, Raiden Ei's body suddenly takes a turn for the worse once more. As if sensing something, she asks you to take her to the cave beneath the Grand Narukami Shrine...
 Surely the Shogun puppet isn't invincible...?
 This is her system to safeguard against modifications to eternity?
 Time for another trip down memory lane.
 Umm...
 Was that a promise to them...?
 We need to talk to Yae Miko.
 We should get you back to the city.
 We're not about to leave her just yet.
 What will happen to Inazuma in the meantime?
 Who have we got this time...
 You don't look too good.
Media:vo sglq102 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We should go. Let's keep following the traces.
Media:vo sglq102 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hey, hey! A—Are you sure you're alright? You're scaring us!
Media:vo sglq102 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Are you alright?
Media:vo sglq102 1 raidenei 01.ogg Ei: Very well. Based on my investigation so far, I believe this next pack of monsters should be the last.
Media:vo sglq102 1 raidenei 02.ogg Ei: Once again, please leave them to me.
Media:vo sglq102 1 raidenei 03.ogg Ei: Fear not. Fighting is what I do best.
Media:vo sglq102 1 raidenei 04.ogg Ei: Ugh...
Media:vo sglq102 1 raidenei 05.ogg Ei: I'm fine, I...
Media:vo sglq102 2 fujiki 01.ogg Fujiki: Wh—Where am I?
Media:vo sglq102 2 fujiki 02.ogg Fujiki: Who are you... *gasp* Almighty Shogun, you're here too!
Media:vo sglq102 2 fujiki 03.ogg Fujiki: Are you injured, Your Excellency?
Media:vo sglq102 2 fujiki 04.ogg Fujiki: We, the Shogunate samurai, will defend the Shogun until the very end!
Media:vo sglq102 2 fujiki 05.ogg Fujiki: Danger is our duty, Ma'am! If we were the kind to shy away from danger, we never would've taken up arms to begin with.
Media:vo sglq102 2 fujiki 06.ogg Fujiki: It certainly is. I know the gods are omnipotent, and their willingness to grant their power to humans means that they have high expectations for us.
Media:vo sglq102 2 fujiki 07.ogg Fujiki: If the Almighty Shogun is in trouble, now of all times is the moment for us to honor that.
Media:vo sglq102 2 fujiki 08.ogg Fujiki: Everyone, on me!
Media:vo sglq102 2 fujiki 09.ogg Fujiki: Huh...?
Media:vo sglq102 2 fujiki 10.ogg Fujiki: Affirmative. But watch your backs!
Media:vo sglq102 2 fukami 01.ogg Fukami: Come on, men! They're coming back for more, let's get them!
Media:vo sglq102 2 fukami 02.ogg Fukami: No need to worry, Almighty Shogun. When the situation looks bleak, we will draw on the power granted to us by the gods.
Media:vo sglq102 2 fukami 03.ogg Fukami: Nobody knew where Your Excellency had gone, and we were starting to despair. But now we've found you. You are right here with us.
Media:vo sglq102 2 fukami 04.ogg Fukami: Just the sight of you appearing before us once more has reignited the hope in our hearts.
Media:vo sglq102 2 fukami 05.ogg Fukami: This hope is the light that will guide us out from the darkness.
Media:vo sglq102 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ei, maybe you should leave this one to us.
Media:vo sglq102 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Don't worry about it! Just take a breather and get your strength back.
Media:vo sglq102 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We'll deal with the monsters!
Media:vo sglq102 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Look... that's the same light again.
Media:vo sglq102 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Is that a Vision?
Media:vo sglq102 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: So that's how samurai of that era understood Visions, huh...
Media:vo sglq102 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: We'll help too!
Media:vo sglq102 2 raidenei 01.ogg Ei: I...
Media:vo sglq102 2 raidenei 02.ogg Ei: My apologies.
Media:vo sglq102 2 raidenei 03.ogg Ei: Ahem... I'm quite alright. Just feeling a little stiff.
Media:vo sglq102 2 raidenei 04.ogg Ei: Don't. It's too dangerous.
Media:vo sglq102 3 fujiki 02.ogg Fujiki: It seems like their attacks are finally over.
Media:vo sglq102 3 fujiki 03.ogg Fujiki: You fought phenomenally. It was truly awe-inspiring.
Media:vo sglq102 3 fujiki 04.ogg Fujiki: The monsters will definitely come back. And when they do, it'll be more than a few rifthounds this time.
Media:vo sglq102 3 fujiki 05.ogg Fujiki: Quickly, escort Her Excellency back to Inazuma City, and regroup with the general's forces as soon as possible.
Media:vo sglq102 3 fujiki 06.ogg Fujiki: We will stay here and guard against the monsters' advance. We cannot afford to let them get any further.
Media:vo sglq102 3 fujiki 07.ogg Fujiki: We are brothers in arms. As long as we stick together, we can face any number of monsters that come our way.
Media:vo sglq102 3 fujiki 08.ogg Fujiki: Glory to the Shogun!
Media:vo sglq102 3 fukami 01.ogg Fukami: Protect the Almighty Shogun!
Media:vo sglq102 3 fukami 03.ogg Fukami: Huh, I've never fought so fiercely before!
Media:vo sglq102 3 fukami 04.ogg Fukami: When everyone sees the Almighty Shogun safely returning, their spirits will be lifted.
Media:vo sglq102 3 fukami 05.ogg Fukami: Just leave it to us! Fighting is what we do best!
Media:vo sglq102 3 fukami 06.ogg Fukami: But the Almighty Shogun is the only one of us with the power to change the present state of affairs. Only Her Excellency can turn back the tide of despair and lead us onward into the future.
Media:vo sglq102 3 fukami 07.ogg Fukami: No matter what kind of threat faces Inazuma, we will always place our faith in the Almighty Shogun!
Media:vo sglq102 3 fukami 08.ogg Fukami: Don't worry, Your Excellency. We will never doubt your word as long as we live!
Media:vo sglq102 3 fukami 09.ogg Fukami: With you leading us, we will claim back everything that Inazuma has lost!
Media:vo sglq102 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Umm... Are you okay? Maybe you should keep resting...
Media:vo sglq102 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Well... what're you guys gonna do?
Media:vo sglq102 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: *gulp*...
Media:vo sglq102 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: ...They're gone.
Media:vo sglq102 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Well... Paimon thinks that even if it's a few hundred years later, you're doing right by them now. And that's what counts.
Media:vo sglq102 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Well said! Sounds to Paimon like you've figured things out.
Media:vo sglq102 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Alrighty then! Let's move on.
Media:vo sglq102 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Ei looks calm on the outside, but Paimon bets her emotions must be all over the place right now, huh?
Media:vo sglq102 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: She seems to have changed a lot since we last met her.
Media:vo sglq102 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: ...Hmm?
Media:vo sglq102 3 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: What's wrong, Ei? C'mon, keep up.
Media:vo sglq102 3 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: What's going on? Are you feeling unwell again?
Media:vo sglq102 3 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Why? What's in there?
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 01.ogg Ei: Thank you all...
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 02.ogg Ei: I'm fine. I feel much better already.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 03.ogg Ei: ...
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 04.ogg Ei: Thank you all very much. I promise you that I will create a bright future for Inazuma.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 05.ogg Ei: I should not have left it this late to make this promise. But from this moment forth, know that I shall be true to my word.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 06.ogg Ei: It was both.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 07.ogg Ei: The people's sacrifice has always caused me immense pain, but in dwelling on the tragedy, I overlooked their splendor... The grief blinded me to how brightly they shone in their final moments.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 08.ogg Ei: The result being that in the centuries since their sacrifice, I have dishonored their will.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 09.ogg Ei: You could take the view that whatever I say to them is meaningless, because they are but disembodied memories held in the Ley Lines.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 10.ogg Ei: But even so, they are due a resolution... I owe it to them and to all the people who have placed their faith in me to date.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 11.ogg Ei: Thank you for your comforting words. But this is my basic duty as Inazuma's archon, and I have neglected it for far too long.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 12.ogg Ei: I used to think just like that samurai... that I was first and foremost a warrior, and my only duty was to face whatever challenge came my way.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 13.ogg Ei: But what Inazuma needs more than a warrior is someone like Makoto.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 14.ogg Ei: Even though I am utterly unlike Makoto, and can never become the person she was, I still need to do the things that she would have done.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 15.ogg Ei: Yes, they are. They are strong and resilient, and have much to be proud of.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 16.ogg Ei: As the Raiden Shogun they revere, I should not be the one to hold them back.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 17.ogg Ei: Change will come to Inazuma, and with it, new possibilities. This will take time, but eventually, the future will bring healing to the scars of the past.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 18.ogg Ei: No matter how long it takes, I am committed to bringing this to fruition. This is my promise.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 19.ogg Ei: Now that we've dealt with the rifthounds, this matter is halfway resolved. It does not appear that the threat will escalate for the time being.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 20.ogg Ei: I will leave the Tenryou and Yashiro Commissions to handle the follow-up work, such as investigating the origins of this incident and tending to the root system.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 21.ogg Ei: Ugh...
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 22.ogg Ei: My body... I can't move it.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 23.ogg Ei: It looks like the situation is more serious than I thought.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 24.ogg Ei: No need. "She" is calling me. The time has come.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 25.ogg Ei: Can you help me walk, (Traveler)?
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 26.ogg Ei: I need to go to the cave below the Grand Narukami Shrine.
Media:vo sglq102 3 raidenei 27.ogg Ei: A battleground... One where I shall sever ties with the past and take the first steps into the future.
Media:vo sglq102 3 together 01.ogg Samurai: Glory to the Shogun!
Media:vo sglq102 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa, where'd that torii gate come from?
Media:vo sglq102 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? What are you talking about? And who is "she" — Makoto?
Media:vo sglq102 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Where are we g— aah, aaah aaaah!!!
Media:vo sglq102 4 raidenei 01.ogg Ei: We're finally here. The entrance should be nearby...
Media:vo sglq102 4 raidenei 02.ogg Ei: It's getting worse again... But it's fine, I'm about to put an end to it all.
Media:vo sglq102 4 raidenei 03.ogg Ei: This is a place I once sealed off with my own hands... The entrance to Raiden Makoto's realm of consciousness.
Media:vo sglq102 4 raidenei 04.ogg Ei: It looks like "she" will no longer allow me to do with this body as I please.
Media:vo sglq102 4 raidenei 05.ogg Ei: Follow me.
Media:vo sglq102 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ugh... Paimon's dizzy, where did we get sucked into this time...
Media:vo sglq102 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whoa! This place...
Media:vo sglq102 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Look! Look, over there!
Media:vo sglq102 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: It's another Ei!
Media:vo sglq102 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Wait, Paimon knows that voice... is that... the puppet!?
Media:vo sglq102 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Uhhh, wait, wait, wait, the atmosphere in here just took a turn for the worse!
Media:vo sglq102 5 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: A—Are you, uh, are you alright now?
Media:vo sglq102 5 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Uh... Paimon gets that everyone has their internal battles and stuff, but... not like this! It's a bit extreme!
Media:vo sglq102 5 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Ei's showdown with the Shogun... Never thought we'd see that day.
Media:vo sglq102 5 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Isn't there any other way? Can't you... talk it through? ...Or something?
Media:vo sglq102 5 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: But they both just want the best for Inazuma...
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenei 01.ogg Ei: I'm here to show you my answer.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenei 02.ogg Ei: We are both warriors, and the dialogue we must now have shall be conducted by the blade alone.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenei 03.ogg Ei: The discomfort I was experiencing earlier was caused by the Shogun rejecting my continued use of her body.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenei 04.ogg Ei: As she indicates, once I started entertaining the idea of change, I became hostile in her eyes.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenei 05.ogg Ei: But inside a realm of consciousness, I exist independently of her. She cannot affect me in this way.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenei 06.ogg Ei: Though she is a puppet, the Shogun has her own consciousness, too. When necessary, she appears here to confront me.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenei 07.ogg Ei: The rules I set for the Shogun are... no, the Shogun herself is the manifestation of my past ideals, the very foundation stone of eternity. It shall not be easily swayed.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenei 08.ogg Ei: I would not try to change her if it wasn't necessary.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenei 09.ogg Ei: Those were my thoughts when I created you.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenei 10.ogg Ei: Now they are towering obstacles that I have no choice but to overcome.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenei 11.ogg Ei: And I am she who promised a dream to her subjects... Raiden Ei.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenshogun 01.ogg Raiden Shogun: We meet again, Traveler.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenshogun 02.ogg Raiden Shogun: This body is an assistant to the one within. But it is also the guardian of the rules.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenshogun 03.ogg Raiden Shogun: Should the one within wish to stray from the rules, this body shall stand in her way.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenshogun 04.ogg Raiden Shogun: You have wandered the realm in my body, and you appear to have grasped the true essence of eternity.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenshogun 05.ogg Raiden Shogun: You believe your present self has greater certainty than your former self. Thus, you believe your present self is correct. Don't you?
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenshogun 06.ogg Raiden Shogun: But have you really been enlightened with new ideas? Or have you been degraded by irreversible erosion?
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenshogun 07.ogg Raiden Shogun: My form is a symbol of supreme majesty, in which has been vested power over all the realm. It is the cohesive embodiment of all that constitutes the "Raiden Shogun."
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenshogun 08.ogg Raiden Shogun: It inherits Ei's pain — the pain of inevitable loss that comes as she moves forward. So too does it inherit her determination to reach eternity.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenshogun 09.ogg Raiden Shogun: Every action undertaken is for the sake of resisting erosion.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenshogun 10.ogg Raiden Shogun: Determination, courage, love, hatred... All of these will be degraded and distorted by the incessant flow of time.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenshogun 11.ogg Raiden Shogun: Only rules shall remain constant for eternity.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenshogun 12.ogg Raiden Shogun: You wish to make yourself my enemy?
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenshogun 13.ogg Raiden Shogun: I am your past, the everlasting law, the guardian of eternity.
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenshogun 14.ogg Raiden Shogun: In the end, even the proud and mighty oni maiden was cut down and disgraced...
Media:vo sglq102 5 raidenshogun 15.ogg Raiden Shogun: Though your blade has been cleansed of her blood and filth, never shall it shine as brightly as it once did.
Media:vo sglq102 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Sh—She's completely recovered!?
Media:vo sglq102 6 raidenei 01.ogg Ei: I shall not fall here.
Media:vo sglq102 6 raidenshogun 01.ogg Raiden Shogun: The Kitsune's Sakura blossoms that once filled the skies fell to the ground as pitch-black rain...
Media:vo sglq102 6 raidenshogun 02.ogg Raiden Shogun: As long as the Ley Lines flow, the relentless erosion of time will never stop.
Media:vo sglq102 6 raidenshogun 03.ogg Raiden Shogun: The divine lightning that envelops all of Inazuma will fade silently into the clouds...
Media:vo sglq102 6 raidenshogun 04.ogg Raiden Shogun: There shall never be another. Never, for the rest of time...
Media:vo sglq102 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Have you finally defeated her?
Media:vo sglq102 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: How the heck...
Media:vo sglq102 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Then... does that mean this is gonna be a never-ending battle?
Media:vo sglq102 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: But, but this means that—
Media:vo sglq102 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Whoa!
Media:vo sglq102 7 raidenei 01.ogg Ei: In this realm of consciousness, her existence is tenacious indeed.
Media:vo sglq102 7 raidenei 02.ogg Ei: She was built to resist erosion. Her will is stronger than any other living being's, including you and me.
Media:vo sglq102 7 raidenei 03.ogg Ei: Maybe. But I have to prove to her that my present will is no product of erosion. The future I shall forge will be a grand undertaking, one that will be resistant to erosion.
Media:vo sglq102 7 raidenei 04.ogg Ei: If I don't do this, the Shogun's rules can never change, and Inazuma can never move forward.
Media:vo sglq102 7 raidenei 05.ogg Ei: This is my duty. No matter how long this battle may last, months, years, centuries... And no matter how many times we must fight, I will defeat her.
Media:vo sglq102 7 raidenei 06.ogg Ei: Five hundred years ago, humanity proved their strength in battle.
Media:vo sglq102 7 raidenei 07.ogg Ei: Here in the present, they rely on their ambition to challenge wayward practices, tear them out like the diseased wood of an old sakura tree, so that new, healthy branches might spring to life in their place.
Media:vo sglq102 7 raidenei 08.ogg Ei: It is about time that I learned to trust them.
Media:vo sglq102 7 raidenei 09.ogg Ei: I understand that. But if the dreams of which Makoto spoke are true eternity, a short moment for which the Shogun does not exist is nothing to fear.
Media:vo sglq102 7 raidenei 10.ogg Ei: I fight for the everlasting future of Inazuma. However long the battle may last, it is but a drop in the ocean of eternity.
Media:vo sglq102 7 raidenei 11.ogg Ei: I vow to the subjects of Inazuma that I shall one day return. This is my oath. Please be my witness.
Media:vo sglq102 7 raidenei 12.ogg Ei: During my absence, I place everything in Miko's hands.
Media:vo sglq102 7 raidenei 13.ogg Ei: Pass on my words.
Media:vo sglq102 7 raidenshogun 01.ogg Raiden Shogun: It appears your martial prowess has not dulled.
Media:vo sglq102 7 raidenshogun 02.ogg Raiden Shogun: But how long can your will remain strong?
Media:vo sglq102 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Looks like we got kicked out...
Media:vo sglq102 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What do we do? Are we really just gonna leave Ei and the Shogun to keep on duking it out in there forever!?
Media:vo sglq102 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: She was making sense, and maybe this is the only way to change the Shogun's rules, but still...
Media:vo sglq102 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Right? Also, Ei can be pretty stubborn at times, and has a history of rushing into difficult situations...
Media:vo sglq102 8 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: What if she gets too obsessed with winning, and she forgets why she's there in the first place? It could happen... And then she might never leave again!
Media:vo sglq102 8 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Yeah! We should help her out, like we did last time. The quicker she gets through this, the better.
Media:vo sglq102 8 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Is there any way we can cut down how long she needs to spend in there? Or, y'know, help her win the fight?
Media:vo sglq102 8 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Well, whatever, we can't let anything bad happen to Ei while she's in there!
Media:vo sglq102 8 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: ...Oh, but we also can't get in there anymore.
Media:vo sglq102 8 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Okay, well first things first, we gotta find a way back in! C'mon brain juice, don't fail Paimon now! Um, okay, maybe if we both ram into it at the same time, really really hard—
Media:vo sglq102 8 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Oh, you're right! Paimon nearly forgot about her!
Media:vo sglq102 8 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Who knows if she really understands these consciousness realm-plane thingies more than we do... But there's no one else we can turn to. Alright, up the mountain we go!
Three samurai emerge from the light at the critical moment.
You are dragged into a mysterious space by some unknown energy.
You were chased out of that dimension by Ei.
