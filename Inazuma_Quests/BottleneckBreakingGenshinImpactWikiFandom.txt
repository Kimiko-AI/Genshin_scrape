 Adventuring is a grueling experience.
 Adventuring is not a game.
 Alright then, come with me. I promise you'll feel better.
 Alright, then follow me.
 Are you feeling okay?
 Are you injured?
 Do you still wish to continue?
 Do you still wish to continue?
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 Don't worry, I'll help you finish whatever's left.
 Don't you think that's a bit much for you?
 Eating like this might have a negative effect on your health. Maybe we should consider some other options.

(Proceed to Branch 2)
 I don't think that will stop you from growing.
 I guess our post-meal plans are settled then.
 I have another idea, Sayu.
 I suppose being taller will make things easier for you.
 I'm not sure if it'll be that easy.
 If you eat any more, I think you might burst.
 Imagine, after you grow taller, you can reach higher places and see much farther, right?
 Is there anything in particular that you'd like to do after you grow taller?
 It can be hard to be nimble with a full stomach.
 It seems you've reached your limit. How about we take a break?
 It seems you've really put a lot of thought into this.
 It simply takes time to grow.
 Kids that love running and jumping everywhere give a strong impression that they are going to grow a lot.
 Let's not get too optimistic, growing takes time.
 Makes sense.
 Maybe sleep has only had the opposite effect on you.
 Okay! We'll take care of it.
 Pretty sure that means you're not okay.
 Quest DescriptionYou tell Sayu that she needs enough nutrition to grow tall. She follows you enthusiastically to Inazuma City...Sayu's eaten a lot already, but her height remains the same. Still, she isn't ready to give up yet...The process of eating to grow taller is rather painful, so you try to get Sayu to try something else — exercise. Will you succeed this time?
 See? You're already in a better mood.
 Sure thing. I've been waiting for a chance to help.
 There's a saying, you know: All good things come to those who wait.
 This isn't the highest you can achieve, you know.
 Though you might not be growing taller now, you can still experience the feeling of growing.
 Uh, are you okay?
 Uh, good luck with that.
 We could always try doing some training.
 We shouldn't bite more than we can chew.
 We've been out for too long.
 What's wrong?
 Why don't you come with me and see if the Adventurers' Guild has any commissions for us to handle?
 You can still reach even higher and see even farther, but you can't do that just by standing here.
 You're just assuming things.
 You're saying getting patted on the head can stunt your growth?
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 kiminamianna 01.ogg Kiminami Anna: Welcome to Kiminami Restaurant! What can I get for the two of you?
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 kiminamianna 02.ogg Kiminami Anna: Pardon my eavesdropping, but did you say that you're going to the Adventurers' Guild to take a commission?
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 kiminamianna 03.ogg Kiminami Anna: Recently, we've been running into a group of rowdy Treasure Hoarders whenever we go into the wild to gather ingredients. It seems as if they're intentionally targeting our restaurant staff. *sigh* I hope you can understand how dire the situation has become.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 kiminamianna 04.ogg Kiminami Anna: This matter has been taking a real toll on our business. Since I've already submitted the commission to Katheryne, perhaps you can consider helping us out?
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 kiminamianna 05.ogg Kiminami Anna: Great, you have my thanks! Let me show you where the Treasure Hoarders have been most active these days.
(Proceed to Exercise Follows Eating)
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: *sniffs* Oh, something smells amazing here! It smells so good that I'd even wake up to find where it's coming from!
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Oh, hmm... Lemme think. I'll have Rice Cake Soup, a Tuna Sushi, a Tricolor Dango... Oh, and one Tri-Flavored Skewer, please.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Time waits for no one, it's time for me to take things into my own hands. If I can't grow more by eating more, then we'll still have time to try something else.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: I've always taken a proactive approach to growing taller. I can even overcome my sleepiness if I need to.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: Speaking of which, I've never been able to eat very much in one sitting. I thought I could try and see what my limits are this time.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: But... if I can't finish it all, would you help me...
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: Ugh, no! That's no good... I've got to stay positive, I know I can finish it all.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: Yay, thanks! That way, I don't have to worry about any of the food going to waste.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: Eating food like this will help me grow right away, won't it? Maybe I'll gain a whole 6 inches!
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Yeah, you might be right. Let's eat everything up and find out.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: *hiccup* Ugh...
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: I'm alright... Don't worry about me...
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: I'm just a bit full, that's all... Ugh, I can't move.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: Ugh, I don't feel like I'm getting taller at all. If anything, I'm only growing wider.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: But if that's the price of getting taller, then I'm willing to pay it.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Okay... Time to order some more Dango.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Dango... Yes, more Dango...
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: I think the Dango are making a swirl reaction in my tummy...
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 19.ogg Sayu: Urgh, who knew Dango could pack such a punch.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 20.ogg Sayu: Ugh, I just don't get it...
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 21.ogg Sayu: Why does growing have to be so difficult!?
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 22.ogg Sayu: But are there any other options? ...I never thought that eating could be so painful.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 23.ogg Sayu: Ugh, believe me, I already know everything there is about training.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 24.ogg Sayu: Hmm, you do have a point...
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 25.ogg Sayu: Now that I think about it, the tallest ninja in the Shuumatsuban always seems to be training their ninjutsu and accepting extremely difficult tasks.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 26.ogg Sayu: No, no, that can't be it... Actually, I haven't kept a good balance of sleep and training, but that's because I feel sleepy way more often than I feel energetic!
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 27.ogg Sayu: Hmm, I get it now. I need to do more training with you. Adventuring, combat — I need to do it all!
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 28.ogg Sayu: Treasure Hoarders, huh? Well, bad guys are the best practice targets for ninjutsu.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 29.ogg Sayu: Let's keep at it. No pain, no gain!
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 30.ogg Sayu: But maybe I could try some other food... All the stuff we just ordered is starting a swirl reaction in my tummy.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 31.ogg Sayu: Yeah, I understand.
Media:vo zycop001 1901302 sayu 32.ogg Sayu: Remember, not too fast now... Oof, my tummy hurts!
(Proceed to Hard Work Pays Off)
Media:vo zycop001 1901303 kiminamianna 01.ogg Kiminami Anna: Thanks again for offering your help. Please do be careful out there.
Media:vo zycop001 1901303 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Anna was right, there's the Treasure Hoarders.
Media:vo zycop001 1901303 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: All that food we just ate is weighing me down a bit, but I think we can still handle them.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: *whimpers*
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: How... How could this happen?
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: No, it's all that big brute's fault. Just as I was taking care of the last of them, he charged straight at me!
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: I moved back to dodge him, but he was too tall... As he reached out to grab me, his hand landed right on my head.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: It's over... It's all over. All that hard work for nothing. Ugh, he crossed the line... Everyone knows that if you're trying to grow taller, you can't be touched on the head.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Of course! I never let anyone touch my head. Who knows how much I'll have to eat and sleep or how much training I'll have to do to make up for it.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: Ugh, it's a real bummer, you know. *sigh* I see you're just trying to comfort me. Thanks...
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: It's not fun to be patted on the head. But what's done is done, there's nothing I can do about it now.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: Uh, just forget it, I give up on growing. I'm not gonna grow any taller today, that's for sure.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Sorry, I don't want to bum you out with my terrible mood. I should probably just go back now. The shrine maiden's gonna give me a real earful, might as well get it over with.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: I get it... I'll try to look at the bright side.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: I was too anxious about growing and now I'm being punished by the archons.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: No, no need. I don't want to trouble you anymore. Maybe my stunted growth is tied to my bad attitude more than anything else.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: Getting you involved any further will just be a waste of your time.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: Huh? "The feeling of growing"... What do you mean?
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Yeah, that's exactly what I'm after.
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Reach higher and see farther... really?
Media:vo zycop001 1901305 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: Sounds good, I appreciate all your help.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: You had me worried on the way here, you know. I seriously wondered if you were taking me to the Kamisato residence or the shrine...
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: But you weren't kidding, I can see much farther from here.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Somehow I feel a little better after coming up so high.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: No, nothing particularly special. I'd simply like to go to the forest and pick some fruit from the trees without having to jump or find something to step on. Just that would be enough to make me happy.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: I'd also like to go swimming in water that's too deep for me now, and no one will tease me anymore for my toes not being able to touch the bottom.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Oh, oh! And I'll be able to eat more, too, and stop wasting food all the time.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: Oh! And not to mention I'll become more free, too!
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: I won't need to have a guardian to look after me, and the shrine maiden won't be out to catch me anymore.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: I'll even be able to visit other places for training. I'll go wherever I want and sleep wherever I want!
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Ah, imagine, no need to catch up on naps anymore. That will be the day...
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: By the way, do you happen to need anyone with ninjutsu skills to accompany you on your adventures?
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: Hm, see? You still see me by my current height. Hmph! Who knows, maybe I'll be even taller than you one day!
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: Just wait till I'm taller. You won't need to worry about me ever again, hehe.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: Yeah, you're right. Thanks.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: From now on, I'll visit high places more often. They really do work miracles.
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Huh? What do you mean?
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Oh, I see. So what should I do?
Media:vo zycop001 1901306 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: Huh? Wh—Wh—Whoaaaa!
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: Sayu? Where are you, Sayu? Come out this instant!
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 kiminamianna 01.ogg Kiminami Anna: She did eat quite a lot, will she be okay?
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 kiminamianna 02.ogg Kiminami Anna: You should keep an eye on her, just in case.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Lesson learned... Next time, only order one dish. If we finish it, then we can order another...
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: That would be a better plan, wouldn't it?
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: No way, I won't give up. Some things can never be achieved until you push yourself.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: If I can't eat any more, then we can always order some tea.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: My body needs to get the signal that I'm trying to grow taller.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Yeah, I'm a little worried about that, too...
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: Ninja must be quick on their feet. It'd be embarrassing to get stuck in a tight passageway.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: But my body will feel my desire to grow and direct all the nutrients to the right place.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: I've already eaten this much, I can't give up now!
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Ugh, that's it, I'm done... Growing is more painful than I thought.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: We still have two Radishes left over. Would you mind finishing them?
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: No, wait a second. Let me think...
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: On second thought, let me try to eat more.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: Otherwise, I'll feel like I didn't give it my best shot. I should at least eat one more.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: Then, I'll call it quits. No more trying to grow by eating.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Whew, alright... Here it goes.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Uh oh! It's the shrine maiden! Not good...
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: She's coming this way! What should we do!?
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 19.ogg Sayu: There's only one option now... I'll lead her away from here and try to shake her off my trail. We'll meet back here later.
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 20.ogg Sayu: I'll just slip away and... Ugh, oh no! My tummy... it's too full...
Media:vo zycop001 1901307 sayu 21.ogg Sayu: Whoa!
Media:vo zycop001 1901308 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Alright, last one. Watch this!
Media:vo zycop001 1901308 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Oh no, aaaaaaah!
Sayu makes herself gobble the two dishes up.
Sayu tries very hard and finishes all the dishes by herself.
