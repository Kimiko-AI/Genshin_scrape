Media:vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Excellent work, (Traveler).
Media:vo xhlq002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hee-hee, all thanks to your genius tactics!
Media:vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Actually, even the best tactics live or die on the strength of those executing them.
Media:vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Winning a battle takes a concerted effort from everyone involved. Victory never belongs to a single person.
Media:vo xhlq002 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Now that you mention it, Paimon did make a pretty big contribution, huh...
 I beg to differ.
Media:vo xhlq002 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hey!

Media:vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 07.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hmm... That wasn't quite what I'd call "by the book"...
Media:vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 08.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: But it happens. Battles are complex things and the situation evolves constantly. It doesn't always help to stick too rigidly to a predetermined plan.
Media:vo xhlq002 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hehe... Seems like as soon as the fighting started, the plan went out the window and we kinda winged it...
Media:vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 09.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: And yet, the outcome is quite satisfactory. A testament to your ability and willingness to adapt.
 And what does the grand strategist have in mind?
 Gunpowder plot.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16b.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Haha, it seems that you share my strategic sensibilities.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16b 1.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: This is my preferred tactic. It places us in the least amount of danger.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16b 2.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's work together to give them the surprise of their lives.
 I beg to differ.
 I'm fine.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 13a.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Heh... This kind of thing is water off a duck's back for you, huh?
 Let's spark things up a little.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16c.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Alright. We'll draw them out first to minimize damage to the camp itself.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16c 1.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I haven't had much chance to fight alongside you in the past, I'm not sure I'll be able to keep up with your pace...
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16c 2.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Still, not to worry. Even if I can't claim to be a warrior myself, I'm no stranger to the battlefield. This fight should be well within my capabilities.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16c 3.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Okay. Let's clear out the camp and find out what they've been up to.
 Quest DescriptionPeace talks between Watatsumi Island and the Tenryou Commission are due to commence, but a rumor that the Tenryou Commission remains in cahoots with the Fatui is still circulating around the island. To uncover the truth, Kokomi decides to assault the Fatui's temporary encampment...
 Something wrong?
 Step DescriptionWhile on your walk around Watatsumi Island, many residents come to chat with Kokomi. You sense there's something... odd about her response.
 Surprise air raid.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16a.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Haha... There's the Swordfish captain I know. Every confidence in your abilities.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16a 1.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: It's decided then — let's fight this one together. I'm no warrior myself, but I can still provide some support. I certainly won't be dropping you into battle all by yourself.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16a 2.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: We should take them down as quickly as possible and retrieve the merchant's goods.
 This is testing my patience.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 13b.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: *sigh* Me too. It does get pretty annoying...
 What are you thinking?
Agent: Ugh! You haven't seen the last of us!
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: This must be the Fatui camp that the merchant was talking about.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: From the looks of it, it used to be a hilichurl camp. Who knows why the Fatui occupied it.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Not by brute force, that's for sure. But that's not a problem. The terrain here gives us an advantage, and we haven't given away our position so far.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 04.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Our enemy is in the light, while we are in the shadows. Strategically, we have the upper hand.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 05.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hmm... I think we have three options available.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 06.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Option 1: Take the king and it's checkmate. The Fatui's presence in Inazuma is weak at present. Nothing more than a few scattered remnants.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 07.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: If we strike from above and take down their leader first, the rest of them will be hard-pressed to put up a serious fight.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 08.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Option 2: Hit them where it hurts. Over there, (Traveler), for example — a store of gunpowder kegs.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 09.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: If we managed to discreetly set the gunpowder alight without alerting them, it would deal them a devastating blow.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 10.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: They'd be caught completely off guard. Both their morale and fighting capacity would be severely impaired.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 11.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Option 3: Use the environment against them. We're close to the sea here, so the air is very humid. I can gather the water vapor, you add a touch of lightning, and together we can shock them into submission.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 12.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: That will depend on our assessment of our own abilities.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 13.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: A surprise attack from the air is the quickest solution, but requires superior combat skills.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 14.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: With an explosion, we could rapidly reduce their numbers without a protracted battle. But absolute stealth would be required during the operation, or we'd risk exposing ourselves.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 15.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: If we decide to take advantage of the environment, we should be prepared for a lengthy siege. So, (Traveler), which is your preferred option?
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16a 1.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: It's decided then — let's fight this one together. I'm no warrior myself, but I can still provide some support. I certainly won't be dropping you into battle all by yourself.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16a 2.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: We should take them down as quickly as possible and retrieve the merchant's goods.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16a.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Haha... There's the Swordfish captain I know. Every confidence in your abilities.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16b 1.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: This is my preferred tactic. It places us in the least amount of danger.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16b 2.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's work together to give them the surprise of their lives.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16b.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Haha, it seems that you share my strategic sensibilities.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16c 1.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I haven't had much chance to fight alongside you in the past, I'm not sure I'll be able to keep up with your pace...
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16c 2.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Still, not to worry. Even if I can't claim to be a warrior myself, I'm no stranger to the battlefield. This fight should be well within my capabilities.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16c 3.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Okay. Let's clear out the camp and find out what they've been up to.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16c.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Alright. We'll draw them out first to minimize damage to the camp itself.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 17.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: The king is overthrown, only the pawns remain!
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 18.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: The explosion was roughly the size I expected. Hopefully, we've given them a fright.
Media:vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 19.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Their movements have become rigid and sluggish. We make a good team!
Media:vo xhlq002 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uhh... looks pretty heavily guarded, how are we supposed to get in?
Media:vo xhlq002 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wow, that's our grand strategist! It's a lot to think about though... which option should we choose?
Media:vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Excellent work, (Traveler).
Media:vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Actually, even the best tactics live or die on the strength of those executing them.
Media:vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Winning a battle takes a concerted effort from everyone involved. Victory never belongs to a single person.
Media:vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 07.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hmm... That wasn't quite what I'd call "by the book"...
Media:vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 08.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: But it happens. Battles are complex things and the situation evolves constantly. It doesn't always help to stick too rigidly to a predetermined plan.
Media:vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 09.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: And yet, the outcome is quite satisfactory. A testament to your ability and willingness to adapt.
Media:vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 10.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I must admit, I wasn't expecting to find the Fatui laying low in a hilichurl camp. Presumably they've been operating out of here in secret for quite some time.
Media:vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 11.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: What's their objective? Are the soldiers right? Could they really be in collusion with the Tenryou Commission?
Media:vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 12.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's scour the camp for evidence. If the merchant's story is true, the inventory should be here.
Media:vo xhlq002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hee-hee, all thanks to your genius tactics!
Media:vo xhlq002 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Now that you mention it, Paimon did make a pretty big contribution, huh...
Media:vo xhlq002 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hey!
Media:vo xhlq002 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hehe... Seems like as soon as the fighting started, the plan went out the window and we kinda winged it...
Media:vo xhlq002 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Alright! Time to take a look around.
Media:vo xhlq002 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa, this place is chock-full of bomb-making materials!
Media:vo xhlq002 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: This is way too dangerous. We should tell Kokomi right away, and figure out the best way to deal with it.
Media:vo xhlq002 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So these are Fatui food supplies?
Media:vo xhlq002 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: They look a little past their best... Is this really all they had to eat?
Media:vo xhlq002 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hey, (Traveler), look here. Could these belong to the merchant?
Media:vo xhlq002 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: There's a lot of stuff, some of it has the Tenryou Commission emblem. Yep, this has gotta be it.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... I see.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh, nothing. I just zoned out for a moment.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's see here... Yes, these are the stolen goods alright.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 04.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Food, medicine, farming tools... All essential for post-war recovery. He was probably stockpiling them until he could make a handsome profit.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 05.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: By contrast, it's doubtful that the Tenryou Commission has any need of these items, so the idea that he was supplying them doesn't make a lot of sense.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 06.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: In all likelihood, he's just an opportunistic merchant. Nothing quite as scandalous as Matsuda and Uchimura had imagined.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 07.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Don't worry, I had already foreseen this.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 08.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: In my recently issued Post-War Temporary Decree, I included restrictions on the prices of essential everyday goods. These items will ultimately reach the people at a reasonable price.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 09.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: If he had taken the time to read the decree, it's unlikely he ever would have ended up in this predicament.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 10.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I wish that were true. Take this alleged collusion between the Tenryou Commission and the Fatui, for example. I'm still completely stumped.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 11.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: The low energy doesn't exactly help...
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 12.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Nothing. Come on, let's take the goods back.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 13.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: It's not long now until the Victory Feast. It'll be a race against the clock to get all of this resolved before it starts.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 14.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Based on the information we gathered from the Fatui camp, there's nothing to suggest he had any correspondence with them.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 15.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Had it been the case, then knowing how the Fatui operates, they would have left some evidence of it.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 16.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: No ifs, no buts. We've recovered the goods. As agreed, this is sufficient to establish his innocence.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 17.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Sir, I'm afraid you're getting ahead of yourself. You may be innocent of the accusations originally leveled at you, but hoarding essential goods is a crime under the Temporary Decree. You must bear the consequences.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 18.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: You have already admitted to being the owner of these goods, so we are obliged to respond with appropriate measures. In addition to enforcing the sale of these goods at the accepted rates, there will also be a fine, the amount of which—
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 19.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I have no business taking sides. As the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island, I abide by the principle of clear and consistent rewards and punishments.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 20.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Just as merit must be recognized, mistakes must be penalized. You may have been proven innocent of the more serious allegations leveled at you, but this does not exempt you from bearing the consequences of your mistakes.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 21.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... It seems the Fatui simply dumped all their stolen goods in one place. Leave the shrine paraphernalia to me. As for the rest, I'll leave you to sift through and try to track down the owners.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 22.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I know that's a lot to ask.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 23.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I understand your concern. I'll be sure to give it further consideration.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 24.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: (Traveler), I'm going to take these items back to the Sangonomiya Shrine. Why don't you come along for the walk?
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 25.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Watatsumi Island observes different customs than the rest of Inazuma. I imagine it must all seem a little alien to you?
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 26.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: It's been a long time since I last came to this village. There's been a lot to deal with recently...
Media:vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 27.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Next time you visit, I'll take you to the visit Watatsumi Island's old shrine.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 matsuda 01.ogg Matsuda: Hmph... I'm not so sure. You could have easily planned the whole thing with the Fatui in advance...
Media:vo xhlq002 4 matsuda 02.ogg Matsuda: Sorry this happened.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 matsuda 03.ogg Matsuda: Well, don't just stand there — take him away! Time to pay up!
Media:vo xhlq002 4 naruse 01.ogg Naruse: My goods! You got 'em back!
Media:vo xhlq002 4 naruse 02.ogg Naruse: Thank you, Your Excellency! And thank you, Captain!
Media:vo xhlq002 4 naruse 03.ogg Naruse: You see? I told you I was innocent!
Media:vo xhlq002 4 naruse 04.ogg Naruse: Hah! What did I tell you? You army numskulls don't have a clue — all brawn and no brains! Coming to me with your crazy conspiracies... Lay off me next time, got it?
Media:vo xhlq002 4 naruse 05.ogg Naruse: Wait, wait, wait! Your Excellency... Whose side are you on here?
Media:vo xhlq002 4 naruse 06.ogg Naruse: Wait a minute! I... But...
Media:vo xhlq002 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Kokomi~!
Media:vo xhlq002 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Kokomi, we found the merchant's stuff. Look!
Media:vo xhlq002 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Uhh... he's hardly a saint, though, right? How could he stockpile things that people are desperate for?
Media:vo xhlq002 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: We're not gonna just give them back to him and let him go, are we? It doesn't feel right...
Media:vo xhlq002 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Kokomi, you think of everything!
Media:vo xhlq002 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Uh... Huh? What do you mean by that?
Media:vo xhlq002 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Got it! First we mend the peace, then we attend the feast!
Media:vo xhlq002 4 uchimura 01.ogg Uchimura: But... what if—
Media:vo xhlq002 4 uchimura 02.ogg Uchimura: Guess we got carried away.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 uchimura 03.ogg Uchimura: Your Excellency, he says all the goods belong to him, but it doesn't add up.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 uchimura 04.ogg Uchimura: Those with a Tenryou Commission emblem are probably his, but not the rest. Especially these ones — they're clearly for shrine use.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 uchimura 05.ogg Uchimura: Not at all, Your Excellency, we're on it.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 uchimura 06.ogg Uchimura: But if I may, Your Excellency... Maybe there were no signs of collusion in this case, but our people know what they saw. Something is going on between the Tenryou Commission and the Fatui.
Media:vo xhlq002 4 uchimura 07.ogg Uchimura: I know the peace talks are coming up, so... please keep an open mind.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 iwata 01.ogg Iwata: Ah, Your Excellency! Boy, am I glad you're here. As you know, agricultural output has taken a pretty big hit this year, let me bring you up to speed on the latest situation...
Media:vo xhlq002 5 izuminaki 01.ogg Izumi Naki: Your Excellency, here you are.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 izuminaki 02.ogg Izumi Naki: There's been a situation. We're still waiting on the delivery of a whole batch of ceremonial items. I'm beginning to worry that they've been stolen...
Media:vo xhlq002 5 izuminaki 03.ogg Izumi Naki: Really? That's fantastic! You never cease to amaze us, Your Excellency!
Media:vo xhlq002 5 izuminaki 04.ogg Izumi Naki: I sorted through all the petitions received recently and placed them on your desk.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 izuminaki 05.ogg Izumi Naki: Also, according to the schedule, you're just in time for your meeting today on the development of the textiles industry...
Media:vo xhlq002 5 izuminaki 06.ogg Izumi Naki: Yes. The two young ladies have arrived safely, we're just waiting for you.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: You know, the earliest shrine on Watatsumi Island was not located in Sangonomiya.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: It was close to the Statue of The Seven. Back then, the people of this island recognized the Shogun's existence, despite not venerating her as the Shogunate do.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: But after she struck down our protector deity, the shrine was abandoned.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 04.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Relations between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate have soured ever since. Mistrust has become deep-rooted over time.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 05.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I've been hoping to raise all this at the peace talks and discuss it properly. Grievances have to be let go eventually...
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 06.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm, thanks for your concern, but I'm fine.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 07.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I appreciate your concerns. I will consider the options carefully and be sure to proceed appropriately.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 08.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Well, if she comes to Sangonomiya, I'll look out for her...
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 09.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Uh... Please remain calm, everyone, I'll get around to all your queries.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 10.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Though for the longer ones, I'd prefer it if you could write a report and submit it to the shrine. Then I can respond to each one as and when I have the time.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 11.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 12.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: (Traveler), are you alright?
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 13a.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Heh... This kind of thing is water off a duck's back for you, huh?
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 13b.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: *sigh* Me too. It does get pretty annoying...
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 14.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh, we retrieved those already — no need to worry.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 15.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: That's today? ...Right now?
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 16.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm, I see... *sigh* (Traveler), I was hoping to take a walk around the island with you, but it looks like we'll have to save that for some other time.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 17.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's rendezvous tomorrow at the entrance to Sangonomiya Shrine. Then we'll go and make preparations for the Victory Feast.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 18.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Haha... That's the name of the game. There'll be some Watatsumi Island specialties which I'm sure you'll enjoy.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 19.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm...
Media:vo xhlq002 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yay, the Victory Feast! Just to be clear, we're talking lots of delicious food, right?
Media:vo xhlq002 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Great! See you tomorrow then!
Media:vo xhlq002 5 ryouko 01a.ogg Media:vo xhlq002 5 ryouko 01b.ogg Ryouko: Oh, Your Excellency, isn't this the captain of Swordfish II? Will (he/she) be based on Watatsumi Island from now on?
Media:vo xhlq002 5 shiori 01.ogg Shiori: Your Excellency? Well, I'll be! Fancy meeting you at a place like this.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 shiori 02.ogg Shiori: Do you know — my daughter's enrolled herself in the shrine maiden selection process this year. If she makes it into Sangonomiya, I'll be one very happy mother! You're a kind and gracious leader. She'd be in very good hands.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 shiori 03.ogg Shiori: *sigh* I'm always telling my daughter that if she gets the chance to learn from Her Excellency directly, she must make the most of it.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 shiori 04.ogg Shiori: I mean, just look at Her Excellency. Still so young, but so mature and intelligent. My daughter has always looked to you as a role model.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 youkou 01.ogg Youkou: Your Excellency, what brings you out this way on your busy schedule?
Media:vo xhlq002 5 youkou 02.ogg Youkou: Oh my, you're looking a little worse for wear... You need to take better care of yourself, okay? All of our fates depend on you...
Media:vo xhlq002 5 youkou 03.ogg Youkou: Come on, that's ancient history. Besides, the fighting is barely over. We should be grateful to be at peace once more.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 yukiya 01.ogg Yukiya: Your Excellency...
Media:vo xhlq002 5 yuna 01.ogg Yuna: Your Excellency, I beg you, heed a word of advice. After all this time fighting the Shogun's Army, peace is not something that can simply be declared.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 yuna 02.ogg Yuna: If we reconcile with them, the god who once protected us will have died in vain...
Media:vo xhlq002 5 yuna 03.ogg Yuna: I know, I know, it's just... *sigh* We should remain strong in these negotiations. We mustn't be too ready to compromise.
Media:vo xhlq002 5 yuna 04.ogg Yuna: Wonderful... We're all counting on you, Your Excellency.
You chat with the friendly people alongside Kokomi...
