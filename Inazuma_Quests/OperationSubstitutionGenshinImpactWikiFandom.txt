 All trees will bloom sooner or later.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: Bloom...
 All trees will cast shade over someone they can protect sooner or later.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: Shade...
 All trees will grow sooner or later.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Grow...
 But didn't you say that you would show me the path to ninjutsu?
 Hold on.
 I believe Sensei hoped that one day you would provide for someone in the same way.
 I don't think a tree of this height will grow any taller.
 I don't think this technique is as easy as it looks...
 I think I have an idea, but it is just a guess.
 I think you're taking this a little too literally.
 I'm really starting to wonder what kind of person your sensei was.
 It seems there was a lot you didn't know about your sensei.
 It's normal for trees to grow taller than people.
 No need to rush.
 Okay... Well, how about some other qualities like their height?
 Quest DescriptionSo Sayu wanted you to learn ninjutsu so that you could replace her at work...
 Seems you haven't grasped the deeper meaning at all.
 Trees should be taller than people.
 What is the rope there used for?
 Where is your sensei now? Have they already left these lands?
 Which is exactly why you should take your work more seriously.
 Why are you talking so different all of a sudden?
 Why don't we just relax for now. We're supposed to be taking a break, remember?
 You can call me "Sensei" if you like.
 You're still Sayu... aren't you?
 Your sensei was also a ninja? Did they go by a special name?

Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: *sigh* Alright, Sayu, just leave the explanation to me. This is a technique to help ninja train their agility.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 02.ogg Kano Nana: When the unpredictable happens during a mission, ninja must be capable of traversing a variety of terrains.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 03.ogg Kano Nana: During our training, we often set up obstacles on both sides of this stream and have Sayu make her way up the course.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 04.ogg Kano Nana: Sayu may be exaggerating a little. With your adventuring experience, I'm sure you'll do fine.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 05.ogg Kano Nana: Nice try, Sayu. You'll run the course first. Quickly, now.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 06a.ogg Kano Nana: Come now, no stalling. Give the Traveler a proper demonstration.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 07.ogg Kano Nana: Although Sayu doesn't usually exert her best effort, she does have strong ninja fundamentals.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 kanonana 08.ogg Kano Nana: Do your best. I'll be waiting at the finish, (Traveler).
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: I'll show you my favorite skill to practice. Basically, it's an escape technique — I use it to make a quick getaway whenever the shrine maiden's after me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: I often slipped when I was little and either found myself falling face-first into the mud or getting battered as I tumbled down.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: So don't underestimate this little course of ours, it's not as easy as you think.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: Yeah, go ahead and give it a try, I'll guide you through it.
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: Aw...
Media:vo zycop001 1901501 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Alright, alright. Leave it to me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: I'm surprised you remember your sensei's words so clearly, Sayu, hehe. But don't you think your sensei would disapprove of you copying their words?
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 kanonana 02.ogg Kano Nana: You remember your Sensei's words, but you sure don't seem to act on them, skipping work all the time...
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 kanonana 03.ogg Kano Nana: *sigh* The problem is that to you, every season is perfect for napping.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 kanonana 04.ogg Kano Nana: Anyway, you've certainly handled the training well so far. The next exercise is live-combat training. Let's go, shall we?
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 kanonana 05.ogg Kano Nana: Considering that you have yet to grasp the art of ninjutsu, we'll let Sayu demonstrate in combat first. And this will be a prime opportunity for you to see her ninjutsu first hand.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 kanonana 06.ogg Kano Nana: *sigh* There you go again, Sayu. You know, imitating what other people say is a poor habit.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Wow, impressive. You've really got some talent.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: If I were to rate your performance, I'd say you're like... a strong, fast mujina.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Anyway, nicely done. I was *yawn* ...rooting for you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: You're still a way off from my personal record, but don't worry, just keep it up.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: If I were to rate your performance, I'd say you're like... an average, everyday kitsune.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: A kitsune is pretty good, you know...
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: Ouch, that was... a little unfortunate.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: If I were to rate your performance, I'd say you're like... a slow, arthritic turtle.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: But don't let that bother you, more practice is all you need.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Hehe, don't mind me, I just happened to remember the words of my sensei.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: After each training session, sensei would give me a score and encourage me based on my results.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: Hehe, no way! Sensei wouldn't be mad at all.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: Yep, Sensei said there were some important matters to attend to.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: Sensei told me that they hoped I would become a responsible ninja while they are away. You know, the kind of ninja everyone can trust.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: Hey, I work hard... when I'm not sleepy. It's just that this season is perfect for napping, I really can't help it.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Sure thing, just leave it to me. Let my example illuminate your path to ninjutsu.
Media:vo zycop001 1901503 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: S—Sorry...
Media:vo zycop001 1901504 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: Here we are. Now, please carefully observe Sayu's skills in combat.
Media:vo zycop001 1901504 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: I'll do my best to make my ninjutsu a little easier to understand.
Media:vo zycop001 1901505 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: You may go have a break with Sayu. It's important to recover your stamina and stay hydrated.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: Alright, that's enough idle chatter for now. If Sayu's sensei ever returns, I'm sure you'll have the chance to meet.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 kanonana 02.ogg Kano Nana: As for our next exercise...
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 kanonana 03.ogg Kano Nana: Fine. Even if I did push you, I suppose you would end up napping on the field anyway.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 kanonana 04.ogg Kano Nana: Go, have a rest. I shall wait for you here. Remember, no running off.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Whew, I'm tired.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: At least I didn't get my outfit dirty... *yawn*
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: So, did you pay close attention to my ninjutsu?
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: Here, I'll teach you. First you stretch your upper body a bit, do a little wiggle... And then turn yourself into a ball, like this...
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: Huh? What's the matter? You don't want to transform into a ball?
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Don't worry, you might feel a little dizzy at first, but you'll get used to it.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: I thought you'd be able to catch on after seeing a quick demonstration.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: *yawn* Anyway, I'm beat and need a good nap now. Hopefully I won't need to demonstrate that again.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: Uh yeah, that was my sensei's teaching... Very strong and patient... which is a little too much work for me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Strong, responsible, and kind. Sensei never pushed me to do more work.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: Uh...
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: Actually, after hearing myself say that, I suppose Sensei was a lot like you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: Although you don't know ninjutsu like Sensei did, your other qualities are enough to make you my sensei.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: Sure, Sensei's name was... Uh, what was it now...? Huh, I guess I never asked, I just called them "sensei."
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: I think Sensei was a ninja. Actually, Sensei never really mentioned it...
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Sensei's height... Hmm, they were taller than me. As for other qualities...
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Sometimes it's hard to tell from just appearances... But these details don't matter to me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: Uh wait, I'm not quite up to it yet... I need to take a break first.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 19.ogg Sayu: We agreed on a break after every two exercises, didn't we? Remember, to keep training from being too forceful...
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 20.ogg Sayu: Got it. Come with me, (Traveler). I'll take you to a nice place to relax a bit.
Media:vo zycop001 1901506 sayu 21.ogg Sayu: Whew. Finally, time for a break!
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Just as I thought, exactly the same as before...
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Sensei knew that I was concerned about my height, so before leaving, Sensei measured my height and used the rope to mark it on the tree over there.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: "Nothing is more satisfying than growing." At least, that's what Sensei told me...
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: But even after all this time, not only have I yet to outgrow the rope... I think the rope is getting higher with the tree.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: *sigh* Maybe it's because I'm not sleeping enough.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: I get it, and that's exactly what I told Sensei at the time.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: But Sensei only laughed, though they didn't scold me at all... I guess Sensei had their own way of looking at things.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: I really couldn't tell what Sensei was thinking in moments like that. Do you have any idea what Sensei might have meant?
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: That's okay, just say it. Either way, I'm sure you understand more than me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Grow...
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: Bloom...
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: Shade...
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: Hmm, I think I understand now.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: I love to take naps under a tree, or hide in the shade, or eat some of its fruit. This is how the tree provides for me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: I see...
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Okay, just wait here. Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: These fruits are for you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: No, no. I get it now! Uh, how should I put it...
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 19.ogg Sayu: Sometimes I think that the Shuumatsuban is more trouble than it's worth. Everyone's trying to keep me from getting enough sleep and growing taller... Sometimes I wonder why I even bother sticking around with them.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 20.ogg Sayu: But every time I think about it, I can't help but remember Sensei's smile, and then I think of this tree, and my Vision.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 21.ogg Sayu: Someday, this tree will also be shelter for a kitsune, or some other animal. In the same way, someday, after I've grown nice and tall, I'll be protecting someone with my ninjutsu.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 22.ogg Sayu: I know...*sigh* Sorry. I guess I was hoping that I'd grow faster, and then I could work hard. But it seems that I've already spent too much time trying to grow...
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 23.ogg Sayu: "If I gave up my dreams of growing tall, could I still fulfill everyone's hopes?" I've always avoided asking myself this question, it just makes me feel a little nervous... And I've yet to find an answer.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 24.ogg Sayu: I still don't know what to do. *sigh* I don't even know what I actually can do... But, I thought that at least I can give you some fruit to eat, hehe.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 25.ogg Sayu: You remind me of Sensei — you're kind and can even understand what Sensei was thinking.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 26.ogg Sayu: So I thought I should at least show a little bit of enthusiasm.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 27.ogg Sayu: Huh? But wasn't I the one teaching you ninjutsu just now?
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 28.ogg Sayu: Although, I'm sure you know a lot more about life than me... So I guess you could still count as my teacher in that regard.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 29.ogg Sayu: Oh yeah, you're right. Hehe, I was getting a little carried away.
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 30.ogg Sayu: Why don't we go practice a little more ninjutsu after our break is up? Today is one of those rare days when I feel super motivated!
Media:vo zycop001 1901507 sayu 31.ogg Sayu: But never mind that for now, we've got lots of fruit to eat. C'mon, take whichever you like, hehe.
Sayu agilely comes upstream and reaches the destination.
Sayu swiftly fetches a pile of fruit and returns.
