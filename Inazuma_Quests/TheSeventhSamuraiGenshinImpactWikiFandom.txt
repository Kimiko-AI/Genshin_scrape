Act 5, Scene 3
...Juusaburou leads the other samurai in a fierce battle with the thieves...
...The offensive led by Juusaburou gradually overpowers the thieves, scattering them in all directions.
Lines:
Kyuuzou: "Come, Juusaburou! The thieves are getting away!"
Juusaburou: "They won't give Taniko up that easily. Keep your eyes peeled!"
...After defeating the thieves, Juusaburou looks around absently and calls out:
Lines:
Juusaburou: "The thieves! Where are the thieves?"
Kyuuzou: "They've all been beaten."
Juusaburou stands on the spot, scanning his surroundings, then bursts into tears.
 "But even when imperiled, the samurai is still samurai."
 "Samurai, like the wind sweeping the earth."
Xavier: You said those words with too much passion. It should be...
 "The battle is lost."
 "You are all certified scarecrows..."
 A... what now?
Xavier: A star! That is to say, the most important actor in a film.
 Alright, let me take a look at the script.
 How did you persuade him to help you out?
Xavier: Come now, our dear soldier understood me just fine. My main job, really, was to persuade Mr. Mikoshi Genjirou to allow me to make a film in Inazuma.
 How's the situation at the Mikage Furnace?
Toranosuke: Ever since Sir Hanbei's "promotion," Yousuke has taken over as the person in charge.
Toranosuke: He is a craftsman by birth and trade, and is very down-to-earth and steady. He gets things done, as well.
Toranosuke: With the Mikage Furnace under his management, I doubt there will be any further problems.
 I understand, Director.
 I'm not quite ready yet...
Xavier: Well, don't worry. Take your time — just let me know when you're ready.
 I'm not ready yet...
Xavier: Well don't worry. Take your time — just let me know when you're ready.
 I'm ready.
Xavier: Wonderful, bravo! In that case, let's begin!
Xavier: I shall make a few adjustments to the Film Kamera and call the soldiers back...
Xavier starts adjusting his Film Kamera...
 I. Am. Juusaburou.
 Is the production going well?
Xavier: To be honest, it's not going that well...
 Maybe I'd like to change roles next time.
Xavier: No problem at all! Once this film has been completed, we should start planning a whole new one.
 Mind if I play a part?
Xavier: Of course! Of course! You are, after all, forever a (hero/heroine) in my heart!
Xavier: I'll always remember that "Tatara Tales" that we acted in together.
 Quest DescriptionXavier seems to be bothered by a certain matter...
 Ready when you are.
Xavier: Wonderful, bravo! In that case, let's begin!
Xavier: I shall make a few adjustments to the Film Kamera and call the soldiers back...
Xavier starts adjusting his Film Kamera...
 Step DescriptionDuring the production of the film, something unexpected seems to have happened. Xavier has something to tell you...
 Step DescriptionXavier is very happy with your performance. He seems to have something more to tell you...
 Step DescriptionYou agree to Xavier's request to help him produce a film...
 To think that Mr. Toranosuke would have time...
Toranosuke: This activity has been approved by our superiors. According to them, it will help to increase the Shogunate's prestige.
Toranosuke: That said, I haven't a clue how Mr. Xavier managed to convince them...
 What are you doing?
 What do you mean to capture through film?
Xavier: Aha! That's a fine question. A fine question indeed. But to be honest, I have yet to think it all through, either.
Xavier: I believe that films can be about anything.
Xavier: Romance! Suspense! Combat! Even all manner of baseless legends can be the subject of films.
Xavier: Though I must say that I think films have some sort of charm that I have yet to fully bring out.
Xavier: Still, I believe that I will find the answer to that question as long as I keep making films.

 What do you think of these films?
Toranosuke: Our superiors believe that these films will help to increase the Shogunate's prestige.
Toranosuke: Perhaps I am simply a little slow on the uptake... but I do not see how this is the case.
Toranosuke: This script is full of these... pessimistic lines. There is nothing of samurai dignity here.
Toranosuke: Who knows what they were thinking, that they agreed to all this...
 What's the theme of your next film?
"Juusaburou" The thief! Where's the thief?
"Juusaburou": They won't give Taniko up that easily. Keep your eyes peeled!
"Kyuuzou": Come, Juusaburou! The thieves are getting away!
"Kyuuzou": They've been beaten.
"Sugimura": ...No doubt for glory, if not for food.
"Sugimura": Hmph. So there are still fools out there who dare to raise their swords against me.
"Sugimura": It matters not. You will soon not have to worry about these two.

Juusaburou stands on the spot, scanning his surroundings, then bursts into tears.
Juusaburou: "The thieves! Where are the thieves?"
Juusaburou: "They won't give Taniko up that easily. Keep your eyes peeled!"
Kyuuzou: "Come, Juusaburou! The thieves are getting away!"
Kyuuzou: "They've all been beaten."
Lines:
Toranosuke: A "swashbuckler film," huh. Mr. Xavier sure does have interesting taste in names.
Toranosuke: But you can't swing your sword like that when you fight against people...
Toranosuke: Ever since Sir Hanbei's "promotion," Yousuke has taken over as the person in charge.
Toranosuke: He is a craftsman by birth and trade, and is very down-to-earth and steady. He gets things done, as well.
Toranosuke: If you only require the "posture"... I have some ideas about that.
Toranosuke: On the whole, yes. When swinging my blade, I should focus not so much on the "action," itself, but the "posture," yes?
Toranosuke: Our superiors believe that these films will help to increase the Shogunate's prestige.
Toranosuke: Perhaps I am simply a little slow on the uptake... but I do not see how this is the case.
Toranosuke: That said, I haven't a clue how Mr. Xavier managed to convince them...

Toranosuke: With the Mikage Furnace under his management, I doubt there will be any further problems.
Xavier starts adjusting his Film Kamera...
Xavier: "Samurai, like the wind sweeping the earth."
Xavier: "Use these scenes of steel clashing against steel to display the majesty of the samurai and the Shogunate."
Xavier: ... Traveler, your line! Read your line!
Xavier: A star! That is to say, the most important actor in a film.
Xavier: After I had a sincere talk with him, he accepted my request quite happily.
Xavier: Ah! Where are you going? Come back, you've gone out of view!
Xavier: Ah, these are lines from another scene... This one is mainly about fighting, so there aren't that many lines.
Xavier: Aha! That's a fine question. A fine question indeed. But to be honest, I have yet to think it all through, either.
Xavier: Aha! That's a fine question. A fine question indeed. But to be honest, I have yet to think it through, either.
Xavier: Alright! Cut! Perfect angle!
Xavier: And as for me, I will never refuse anything that will help me make my films.
Xavier: As you can see, I'm shooting a swashbuckler film with our good soldier here. I call it "The Seventh Samurai."
Xavier: But I was always interested in this sort of subject matter anyway, so of course, I agreed to it, and Lord Mikoshi Genjirou was also very pleased.
Xavier: But regardless, I have to finish producing "The Seventh Samurai" first.
Xavier: But... In exchange, I have to do a movie that has to do with the Shogunate, preferably with a samurai as the protagonist.
Xavier: Come now, our dear soldier understood me just fine. My main job, really, was to persuade Mr. Mikoshi Genjirou to allow me to make a film in Inazuma.
Xavier: Come, come! Just read the script and the lines first. This part is mainly about fighting...
Xavier: Do you still remember what I said about the play? It is supposed to feel liberating and give the audience a sense of the vicissitudes of life. I said liberating! Liberating, you understand?
Xavier: Honestly, Mr. Mikoshi Genjirou is such a... serious man. Fortunately, he is also most understanding.
Xavier: I believe that films can be about anything.
Xavier: I believe that with your strength and understanding, you will be able to perform brilliantly in front of the Kamera...
Xavier: I have to say, Mr. Genjirou really is a man of vision, to have grasped the potential of using films as a marketing tool so very quickly...
Xavier: I shall make a few adjustments to the Film Kamera and call the soldiers back...
Xavier: I'll always remember that "Tatara Tales" that we acted in together.
Xavier: If this satisfies those fellows upstairs, I do suspect that future film projects shall progress much more smoothly.
Xavier: In addition to personally appointing our good soldier to go with me, he also assigned some skilled troops to me, and then he said...
Xavier: In this scene, one of your companions, "Kyuuzou," has lines... I'll play his part, and the two of us will do a reading.
Xavier: Let me know when you are ready. I have to adjust the Film Kamera's position...
Xavier: Moreover, don't swing your sword in such haste... Make sure you are in view, otherwise, the Film Kamera will not be able to capture your movements at all.
Xavier: No problem at all! Once this film has been completed, we should start planning a whole new one.
Xavier: Not only are their sword movements too fast for the Film Kamera to record, they sometimes even run outside of its view.
Xavier: Now then, Mr. Soldier. You saw that demonstration clearly, I trust?
Xavier: Now, you must embody the role, understand it! Just think of yourself as Juusaburou. Do you understand?
Xavier: Of course! Of course! You are, after all, forever a (hero/heroine) in my heart!
Xavier: Oh dear me, this film doesn't seem to have come out right...
Xavier: Oh, "swashbuckler film" is what I'm calling films of this genre.
Xavier: Oh, by the way, you'll be playing the role of "Juusaburou." Together with several companions, he is employed by the villagers to protect their village...
Xavier: Oh, it's you! Ah, my dear (boy/girl), a fair wind must have blown you here.
Xavier: Oh? That's wonderful! Please discuss the matter with your fellow soldiers, and we'll do another take in a while.
Xavier: Perfect! As expected of the (hero/heroine) of my heart! A perfect demonstration! You truly are a star!
Xavier: Please get ready again, and we shall give it another go.
Xavier: Pose, and then pause, okay? Stop for a moment, then slice downwards with great force.
Xavier: Romance! Suspense! Combat! Even all manner of baseless legends can be the subject of films.
Xavier: Should we do one about the various traditions of the Grand Narukami Shrine? Or the tales of the kitsune and the tanuki?
Xavier: So, are you ready?
Xavier: Still, I believe that I will find the answer to that question as long as I keep making films.
Xavier: The next film, hmm? Well... Actually, I'm quite torn on what its topic should be myself.
Xavier: There are so many islands here in Inazuma, and so many stories to be told!
Xavier: They should be able to better understand the story after watching it from the spectator's point of view.
Xavier: This line is key to the whole play. You must express your emotions completely, fully, and perfectly!
Xavier: This sort of film shall have sword-fighting scenes, and it shall take the viewers on an incredible journey across the battlefield... Well, that's the idea, at least!
Xavier: Though I must say that I think films have some sort of charm that I am yet to fully bring out.
Xavier: Though I must say that I think films have some sort of charm that I have yet to fully bring out.
Xavier: To be honest, it's not going that well...
Xavier: Traveler, I can't get a good shot if you swing your sword like that. Could you use a bit more force?
Xavier: Traveler, if you have time, do you mind following my script and acting the story out for the soldiers to see?
Xavier: True, but you have to tailor your acting to the production's needs.
Xavier: Wait! Ah, Sir Soldier, the line you read lacks the right emotional gravitas.
Xavier: Well don't worry. Take your time — just let me know when you're ready.
Xavier: Well then. Please ready up, and we shall give this another go...
Xavier: Well, don't worry. Take your time — just let me know when you're ready.
Xavier: While these soldiers are highly skilled in martial arts, they are not used to this kind of staged fighting.
Xavier: Wonderful! Splendid! Bravo!
Xavier: Wonderful, bravo! In that case, let's begin!
Xavier: You have my utmost gratitude for your help, Traveler. Here. These are for you.
Xavier: You said those words with too much passion. It should be...
