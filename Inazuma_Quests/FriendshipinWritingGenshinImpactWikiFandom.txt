 "Farewell, Literature Hunt Decree!"
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 16b 1.ogg Paimon: "The strict Principal Raiden of the Inazuma Academy decided to confiscate all light novels."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 16b 2.ogg Paimon: "With the help of Lady Kitsune, the protagonist defeats Principal Raiden in an exam before the throne, forcing the principal to abolish the Literature Hunt Decree..."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 16b 3.ogg Paimon: Are we absolutely sure we can publish this...?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 30b.ogg Yae Miko: We can and we will! I think it's great!
 "I Turned Into a Geovishap Hatchling!"
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15c 1.ogg Paimon: "The protagonist awakes to find themselves turned into a Geovishap Hatchling surrounded by countless adventurers."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15c 2.ogg Paimon: "But then, the protagonist suddenly discovers that they have a special ability: keep rolling to keep evolving..."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15c 3.ogg Paimon: "So the protagonist rolled and rolled and rolled, hoping to evolve into the strongest Geo creature ever!"
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15c 4.ogg Paimon: So the protagonist is no longer a human, huh? Good luck retconning that after chapter one!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27c 1.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... I give it a 9.5!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27c 2.ogg Yae Miko: "Monster evolution" is an increasingly common theme these days. What started out as a rather niche genre has gradually worked its way into the mainstream.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27c 3.ogg Yae Miko: And I wouldn't worry about the continuity issue. All we have to do is explain at the beginning of the work that the protagonist can travel between different worlds. Or just explain it away as a dream.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15c 5.ogg Paimon: Ugh, no integrity whatsoever!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27c 4.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe... The most important thing is that it's fun. In light novels, as in life, having fun is the most important thing. Wouldn't you agree?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15c 6.ogg Paimon: Hmm. You do kinda have a point...
 "Reincarnated in Another World: Encounters with Airborne Emergency Rations"
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07a.ogg Paimon: No! No one would ever go for that, no matter how you tried to play it!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14a.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... Out of a maximum of 10 points, I'd give that a 9!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14a 1.ogg Yae Miko: Is there really flying emergency food in other worlds? How does it taste? And how do you cook it?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14a 2.ogg Yae Miko: It's a strong opening — an easy way to grab the readers' attention. Never underestimate the appeal of culinary-oriented subject matter. Food, after all, is a topic that everyone is interested in.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07a 1.ogg Paimon: Hey!
 "Rock 'N' Roll Girl!!!"
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15b 1.ogg Paimon: "The Liyue Academy has more student clubs than you can shake a stick at, and as the new kid on the block, the protagonist is the one they're all fighting over..."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15b 2.ogg Paimon: "There's the Culinary Club, the Architecture Club, the Funerary Club, even the Coconut Milk Research Club... But in the end, the protagonist chose to join the Rock 'N' Roll Club."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15b 3.ogg Paimon: "Taking a chance on their youthful dreams, four newcomers to the academy form a rock 'n' roll band that really begins to take off!"
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15b 4.ogg Paimon: Paimon loves it!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27b 1.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... I give it a 9.5!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27b 2.ogg Yae Miko: A classic tale of youth and friendship. It never gets old.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27b 3.ogg Yae Miko: I especially like the head of the club. Great character design. She really has rock 'n' roll coursing through her veins. I can almost feel the heat from that fire in her soul. Approved!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15b 5.ogg Paimon: Aw, yeah!
 "Starting as a Resistance Soldier"
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 16c 1.ogg Paimon: "When the Vision Hunt Decree comes out of nowhere, the protagonist joins the resistance, starting out as an ordinary rank-and-file soldier."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 16c 2.ogg Paimon: "Find out how the protagonist goes on to make great contributions to the war effort, become best friends with the resistance general, and get to know the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine, working together with everyone to finally secure a grand victory for the resistance..."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 16c 3.ogg Paimon: Huh, it's... surprisingly normal...
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 30c.ogg Yae Miko: I think it's rather good. A lot of people still like the classic hero's journey. From ordinary soldier to great leader — a fresh take on a timeless classic.
 "Stuff This! C'mon, Let's Get Rid of This Vision Hunt Decree!"
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 30a 1.ogg Yae Miko: Mm, clearly very closely based on your own personal experience, with no major changes at all.
 Well, I'm running low on inspiration...
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 30a 2.ogg Yae Miko: That's fine. Since it's something that took place in Inazuma, it might actually be more interesting to readers if it's grounded in the truth.
 "The Dragon and the Grand Adventure"
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07c.ogg Paimon: This sounds like a great one!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07c 1.ogg Paimon: Let's see here... "The protagonist arrives in Mondstadt for the first time to the sight of a dragon flying around and wreaking havoc on the city."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07c 2.ogg Paimon: "With the help of some trusty companions, the protagonist successfully defeats the dragon. But then... the dragon suddenly turns into a beautiful young woman..." ...Huh?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07c 3.ogg Paimon: "Human, let us work together to build a better future! The love story between human and dragon begins today..."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07c 4.ogg Paimon: Well that was an unexpected development. What happened to the grand adventure!?
 "The Grand Adventure" is just the protagonist's name.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07c 5.ogg Paimon: What!? But that's so misleading!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14c.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... Out of a maximum of 10 points, I'd give that a 9!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14c 1.ogg Yae Miko: The story certainly goes in an unorthodox direction. And the dragon-girl sounds destined to be a hit character. Approved!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07c 6.ogg Paimon: What the heck!
 "The Grand Adventure" is just the protagonist's name.
 "The Work-Shy Bard"
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07b.ogg Paimon: Let's see what you've got... "After enrolling in the Mondstadt Academy, I found out that the young man sitting next to me in class was a total slacker."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07b 1.ogg Paimon: "He said he was a bard, had a habit of playing his lyre in class, and always had a bottle of liquor on his person. But his true identity was actually the principal of the academy..."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07b 2.ogg Paimon: What kind of plot is that!?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14b.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... Out of a maximum of 10 points, I'd give that a 9.5!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14b 1.ogg Yae Miko: It just goes to show, you have to have an interesting character sitting in the back row by the window.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14b 2.ogg Yae Miko: The protagonist is a transfer student, new to the school, whose ordinary life is about to take a wild turn when they meet the ballad-and-alcohol-loving principal. Sounds interesting. Approved!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07b 3.ogg Paimon: Paimon just does not see the appeal...
 "Took a Trip to Liyue, Tour Guide Turned Out to Be Rex Lapis"
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15a 1.ogg Paimon: Let's see now... "The protagonist arrives in Liyue and befriends a young man who doesn't have the money to pay for anything. Only later do we find out that this young man is none other than Rex Lapis himself."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15a 2.ogg Paimon: "With the help of the Qixing and the protection of the adepti, I am free to roam this vast realm..."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15a 3.ogg Paimon: Hmm, is this the kind of "cheap thrill" that that guy was talking about?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27a 1.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... I give it a 9.8!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27a 2.ogg Yae Miko: The story is fun and action-packed, with no dark undertones. Also, there are a great many legends about Rex Lapis. I'm sure it will spark the people's curiosity.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27a 3.ogg Yae Miko: I, for one, think there's a sizable market for this. Approved.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15a 4.ogg Paimon: Alright, well... let's just hope Zhongli doesn't mind.
 Can I really do that?
 I can't think of any more stories...
 I've never written a novel before.
 Is it too late for me to back out?
 My mind's gone blank...
 Paycheck... hmm, speaking of "Mora"...
 Quest DescriptionIt turns out that Youhei and Shingo had summoned a spirit with the method recorded in "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits." Yae Miko suggests going to the Yae Publishing House to discuss how to respond...
 Step DescriptionHaving handed in the light novel, the work of many hands hard at work, you wonder how the sales figures will look. Well, looks like there's nothing to do but wait for now.
 Step DescriptionKuroda has agreed to get Ms. Hina to help out. Which is just as well — it's about time to meet everyone at the submission event location.
 Step DescriptionUnexpectedly, Yae Miko intends to publish a new light novel to blow the competition out of the water. It might be best to start figuring out what the readers would like...
 Step DescriptionWith the readers' preferences in hand, it's time to head to Uyuu Restaurant to finish that light novel.
 Step DescriptionYou've finished the outline of the light novel. While the authors are rushing the manuscript out, time to go to Yae Publishing House to ask for Ms. Hina's endorsement.
 This is all great, but...
 This sounds very dubious.
 Wait, so does this mean...
 Wait, so you mean...
 We had a top-notch team.
 We're all professionals.
 Well, I'm running low on inspiration...
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 junkichi 01.ogg Junkichi: Mr. Shigeru, I thought we agreed not to speak of this?
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 kuroda 01.ogg Kuroda: Lady Guuji has an eye for things like this. If she thinks your work is interesting, you can be sure it's destined for success.
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 kyouta 01.ogg Kyouta: Have you made a submission? Wow, you turned that around pretty quickly! Seems like I'm in for a treat soon, haha!
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 kyouta 02.ogg Kyouta: I don't usually like the kaidan genre, but "The Secret Spells of Lady Kitsune" is an exception.
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 kyouta 03.ogg Kyouta: I'm definitely going to give it a try as soon as we have a moonless night. Here's hoping Lady Kitsune will make my wishes come true...
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 nakanoshino 01.ogg Nakano Shino: The Yae Publishing House has held many writers' submission events to date.
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 nakanoshino 02.ogg Nakano Shino: The winner gets a huge amount of publicity. It's been the ticket to fame for a lot of authors! If you've got a good idea for a story, you definitely don't want to miss out!
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 nakanoshino 03.ogg Nakano Shino: After "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" took off, a whole host of copycat works appeared on the market. But they were such low quality that no one paid them any attention.
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 nakanoshino 04.ogg Nakano Shino: It just goes to show that you should write to your own interests. If you just try and imitate someone else, you'll lose your way.
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 nakanoshino 05.ogg Nakano Shino: Wow... I never expected this submission event would uncover such talented authors.
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 nakanoshino 06.ogg Nakano Shino: To make sure you can all deliver your best work, we should fix an issue date for the next volume now.
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 oosuke 01.ogg Oosuke: I'm not buying it unless the illustrations are good.
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 oosuke 02.ogg Oosuke: I bought three copies of this light novel. One to read, one for my collection, and another one to lend out to my friends.
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 oosuke 03.ogg Oosuke: It's worth the price just for the gorgeous illustrations alone!
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh yeah, how did it go with that incantation from "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits"? Did you manage to make a wish in the end?
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wow, she seems really in the zone. Let's not disturb her.
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 satomi 01.ogg Satomi: Hmm... add a little foreshadowing here... callback to the first chapter there — callback via contrast, that is... plot twist here, obviously. Now, where's the best to explore the central theme...
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 shigeru 01.ogg Shigeru: Don't worry, this story has a very clear narrative structure. Junkichi will definitely be able to work his magic on the writing front.
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 shigeru 02.ogg Shigeru: Nope! On the first day, Junkichi couldn't memorize the incantation, because it was too long. On the second day, he didn't wake up in time, and midnight came and went. Then, on the third day—
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 tetsuo 01.ogg Tetsuo: I've finished "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" now. I wonder if I'll be able to find another one as good as that?
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 tetsuo 02.ogg Tetsuo: If I can't find anything else to my liking, I guess I'll just have to read "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" again.
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 tetsuo 03.ogg Tetsuo: Honestly, it's a really gripping story. I'm still feeling pumped up!
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 tetsuo 04.ogg Tetsuo: I hope the next volume comes out soon... Wait, when is it coming out, actually? Aw man, I hope it won't be a really long wait...
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: Let me think... What spell does Lady Kitsune teach to the protagonist? ...Ah, I've got it!
Media:vo dialog ymlq002 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: Hee-hee, I've got to make sure it sounds suitably mysterious...
Media:vo ymlq002 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Alright, Miko, we're here. So, what's your plan of action to deal with this rival book?
Media:vo ymlq002 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmmmm... Oh, Paimon knows! Combine the reputation of the Yae Publishing House with the status of Guuji Yae and tell everyone that the incantations in that book are dangerous!
Media:vo ymlq002 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yeah— Aww! ...Wait, seriously? That wasn't it?
Media:vo ymlq002 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Okay, yeah, that would be pretty catastrophic... Oh! How about we confiscate all the copies?
Media:vo ymlq002 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: But that means there's nothing we can do...
Media:vo ymlq002 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Wait, Miko, so you want us to write a novel?
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... Why don't you take a guess?
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: I'll give you a hint. It's to do with the Yae Publishing House.
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: Ooh, wow! Your first guess, and you got it absolutely...
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: ...wrong.
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 05.ogg Yae Miko: "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" is the hottest light novel right now. If we did as you suggested, we would effectively be advertising to everyone that the incantations are real.
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 06.ogg Yae Miko: In bending over backwards trying to warn everyone about the dangers, all we would accomplish is to create more curious readers ready to try them out. Also, sales for the book would only increase further.
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 07.ogg Yae Miko: *sigh* Leaving aside the issue of the enormous manpower and resources such an operation would require, going to such lengths over a light novel would be extremely disruptive to the lives of Inazumans.
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 08.ogg Yae Miko: Well I've been thinking...
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 09.ogg Yae Miko: I've read "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits." It has many other good qualities besides the incantations alone.
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 10.ogg Yae Miko: The book contains many ancient "kaidan" — or tales of the supernatural — and is written in a very engaging way. That is why the book has become so popular.
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 11.ogg Yae Miko: I think we're going to have a difficult time trying to rein in its popularity while it's the only work in its league on the market.
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 12.ogg Yae Miko: That's right. How do you get rid of the next big thing? You replace it with the next next big thing.
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 13.ogg Yae Miko: So what we're going to do is create Inazuma's newest hit novel.
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 14.ogg Yae Miko: Smash our rival's sales numbers and win our readers back. That is how Yae Miko wages war!
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 15.ogg Yae Miko: Incidentally, this will also be the best way to combat the influence of "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits."
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 16.ogg Yae Miko: Heh, well, becoming an accomplished novelist certainly isn't an overnight process. But let's not forget that I am the chief editor of the Yae Publishing House. I have my ways.
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 17.ogg Yae Miko: I did say this is what "we're" going to do. I trust that the word "teamwork" is in your vocabulary.
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 18.ogg Yae Miko: Anyway. There's a writers' submission event going on at the moment. Start by talking to readers and finding out what they're into. When you have an idea of what the current trends are, come back and see me.
Media:vo ymlq002 1 yaemiko 19.ogg Yae Miko: I'll be at Uyuu Restaurant — find me there when you're done. I will assemble a team, and we can work while we eat.
Media:vo ymlq002 2 kyouta 01.ogg Kyouta: I've been reading light novels for long time now. I'm mainly into big, ambitious fantasy works with an original core concept and good storytelling.
Media:vo ymlq002 2 kyouta 02.ogg Kyouta: These days, though, everyone seems to be imitating each other. Most of the time I can guess what the story is about just from the title.
Media:vo ymlq002 2 kyouta 03.ogg Kyouta: The only recent book worth mentioning is "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits."
Media:vo ymlq002 2 kyouta 04.ogg Kyouta: Not only is it a good story, but the descriptions are really true to life. So much so that I'm almost wondering if maybe the author really has met all those youkai before.
Media:vo ymlq002 2 oosuke 01.ogg Oosuke: The key to a successful light novel is having good illustrations.
Media:vo ymlq002 2 oosuke 02.ogg Oosuke: When to use illustrations, what they should contain, and which artist you should commission for them... These are all key things to bear in mind.
Media:vo ymlq002 2 oosuke 03.ogg Oosuke: Good illustrations can make up for bad writing. But on the flip side, a bad illustration can ruin your novel, even if you have the best story in the world.
Media:vo ymlq002 2 oosuke 04.ogg Oosuke: There's a saying that light novels are essentially a case of "buy art, get words free." I'd agree with that. Too bad most of the top artists have jam-packed schedules, so it's extremely difficult to commission them...
Media:vo ymlq002 2 oosuke 05.ogg Oosuke: The illustrations in "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" are incredible, but it's unlike any art style I've ever seen before.
Media:vo ymlq002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: There's much more to light novels than Paimon realized... Let's go tell our findings to Yae Miko, (Traveler)!
Media:vo ymlq002 2 tetsuo 01.ogg Tetsuo: I'll be honest. I read light novels for the cheap thrills.
Media:vo ymlq002 2 tetsuo 02.ogg Tetsuo: In most traditional stories, the protagonist usually has this long and drawn out character arc, usually involving a process of separation, loss, and ultimately growth and renewed strength. It reads well, and everything, it's just a little slow-paced for me.
Media:vo ymlq002 2 tetsuo 03.ogg Tetsuo: By contrast, there's this popular light novel at the moment called "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits," where the protagonist is super strong right from the get-go! That's what I mean by cheap thrills: action-packed right from page one.
Media:vo ymlq002 2 tetsuo 04.ogg Tetsuo: The protagonist is a kitsune who has not only mastered the secret art of incantations, but also tea ceremony, painting, and calligraphy!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 junkichi 01.ogg Junkichi: Yeah, we think it works. I tend to overcomplicate the core concept if I'm not careful, so this deals with that problem.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh-huh, it definitely makes sense! Hehe.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon followed pretty much all of that, but there's still one question... what are we actually gonna write about?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: For example, we know we need an original core concept... but how do we come up with one?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Ohh, right! So maybe we can take inspiration from our time in Mondstadt and Liyue!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hmm, but that would make it a completely different genre than "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits"... Uh, is that gonna be a problem?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Alright! Let's start with chapter one, then. Uh... what are you thinking, (Traveler)?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07a 1.ogg Paimon: Hey!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07a.ogg Paimon: No! No one would ever go for that, no matter how you tried to play it!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07b 1.ogg Paimon: "He said he was a bard, had a habit of playing his lyre in class, and always had a bottle of liquor on his person. But his true identity was actually the principal of the academy..."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07b 2.ogg Paimon: What kind of plot is that!?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07b 3.ogg Paimon: Paimon just does not see the appeal...
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07b.ogg Paimon: Let's see what you've got... "After enrolling in the Mondstadt Academy, I found out that the young man sitting next to me in class was a total slacker."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07c 1.ogg Paimon: Let's see here... "The protagonist arrives in Mondstadt for the first time to the sight of a dragon flying around and wreaking havoc on the city."

Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07c 5.ogg Paimon: What!? But that's so misleading!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07c 6.ogg Paimon: What the heck!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 07c.ogg Paimon: This sounds like a great one!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Huh? Won't that do for now?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Hmm? What's wrong with you, (Traveler)? You don't look so good...
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Before it came to what? What's happened?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Sounds awful.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Your treat? Oh, wait a minute. Miko, we'll be getting paid for all the hard work we're doing, right?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Alright, cool! Then let's press on, shall we, (Traveler)? Don't give up now! For the sake of our paycheck, get your brain going!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Ooh, ooh! Does this mean your inspiration's come back?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15a 1.ogg Paimon: Let's see now... "The protagonist arrives in Liyue and befriends a young man who doesn't have the money to pay for anything. Only later do we find out that this young man is none other than Rex Lapis himself."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15a 2.ogg Paimon: "With the help of the Qixing and the protection of the adepti, I am free to roam this vast realm..."

Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15a 4.ogg Paimon: Alright, well... let's just hope Zhongli doesn't mind.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15b 1.ogg Paimon: "The Liyue Academy has more student clubs than you can shake a stick at, and as the new kid on the block, the protagonist is the one they're all fighting over..."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15b 2.ogg Paimon: "There's the Culinary Club, the Architecture Club, the Funerary Club, even the Coconut Milk Research Club... But in the end, the protagonist chose to join the Rock 'N' Roll Club."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15b 3.ogg Paimon: "Taking a chance on their youthful dreams, four newcomers to the academy form a rock 'n' roll band that really begins to take off!"
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15b 4.ogg Paimon: Paimon loves it!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15b 5.ogg Paimon: Aw, yeah!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15c 1.ogg Paimon: "The protagonist awakes to find themselves turned into a Geovishap Hatchling surrounded by countless adventurers."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15c 2.ogg Paimon: "But then, the protagonist suddenly discovers that they have a special ability: keep rolling to keep evolving..."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15c 3.ogg Paimon: "So the protagonist rolled and rolled and rolled, hoping to evolve into the strongest Geo creature ever!"
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15c 4.ogg Paimon: So the protagonist is no longer a human, huh? Good luck retconning that after chapter one!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15c 5.ogg Paimon: Ugh, no integrity whatsoever!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 15c 6.ogg Paimon: Hmm. You do kinda have a point...
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 16b 1.ogg Paimon: "The strict Principal Raiden of the Inazuma Academy decided to confiscate all light novels."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 16b 2.ogg Paimon: "With the help of Lady Kitsune, the protagonist defeats Principal Raiden in an exam before the throne, forcing the principal to abolish the Literature Hunt Decree..."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 16b 3.ogg Paimon: Are we absolutely sure we can publish this...?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 16c 1.ogg Paimon: "When the Vision Hunt Decree comes out of nowhere, the protagonist joins the resistance, starting out as an ordinary rank-and-file soldier."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 16c 2.ogg Paimon: "Find out how the protagonist goes on to make great contributions to the war effort, become best friends with the resistance general, and get to know the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine, working together with everyone to finally secure a grand victory for the resistance..."
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 16c 3.ogg Paimon: Huh, it's... surprisingly normal...
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Whoa, so we're really going head-to-head with our rival on this one, huh?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Are we done, then? Do you really think this will be able to beat "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits"?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 satomi 01.ogg Satomi: Leave it to me, Lady Yae.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: Ah, there you are. Let me introduce the team:
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: You've already met Junkichi and Shigeru.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: Shigeru is an experienced editor and Junkichi is the author he's partnered with. Junkichi's working through a creative lull at the moment, but all his past works have been very popular with young people. He has developed a distinct and enduringly popular style.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: Satomi is Yae Publishing House's ace in the hole. Her specialty is that she can write all kinds of completely different stories, and all under different pen names. As for what those names are, well, that's a trade secret.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 05.ogg Yae Miko: They will be teaming up with us to collectively create the novel that knocks "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" off its perch. So? Feeling better about my plan now?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 06.ogg Yae Miko: Now then, tell me what you found out about readers' preferences.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 07.ogg Yae Miko: All very true. An original core concept, a fast pace, quality illustrations, and lots of action. This is the formula that will guarantee good sales numbers.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 08.ogg Yae Miko: More importantly than that, even though it's a work of fiction, we have to deliver a sense of realism.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 09.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe... Before you can answer that question, you have to understand your target audience.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 10.ogg Yae Miko: Take "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits," for example. When I read it, all I find is common knowledge to the kitsune. But to the general public, it's bursting with new and interesting ideas. It all comes down to the size of the information gap between author and reader.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 11.ogg Yae Miko: As a Traveler, there must be a great many things you know about that are complete unknowns to the people of Inazuma. What is commonplace to you may be fresh and original to them.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 12.ogg Yae Miko: Not at all. You don't have to worry so much about how to compete with that book. All you have to do is provide some interesting ideas based on your travel experiences.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 13.ogg Yae Miko: As long as the core content is interesting, my expert team here will be able to flesh out the details.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14a 1.ogg Yae Miko: Is there really flying emergency food in other worlds? How does it taste? And how do you cook it?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14a 2.ogg Yae Miko: It's a strong opening — an easy way to grab the readers' attention. Never underestimate the appeal of culinary-oriented subject matter. Food, after all, is a topic that everyone is interested in.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14a.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... Out of a maximum of 10 points, I'd give that a 9!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14b 1.ogg Yae Miko: It just goes to show, you have to have an interesting character sitting in the back row by the window.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14b 2.ogg Yae Miko: The protagonist is a transfer student, new to the school, whose ordinary life is about to take a wild turn when they meet the ballad-and-alcohol-loving principal. Sounds interesting. Approved!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14b.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... Out of a maximum of 10 points, I'd give that a 9.5!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14c 1.ogg Yae Miko: The story certainly goes in an unorthodox direction. And the dragon-girl sounds destined to be a hit character. Approved!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 14c.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... Out of a maximum of 10 points, I'd give that a 9!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 15.ogg Yae Miko: Good job, little one. You're not only drawing on your own experiences, but it seems you're filtering them through the lens of the kinds of light novels you've read in the past. I think you really understand what we're trying to do here.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 16.ogg Yae Miko: Thoughts from the experts? Are we able to work with this general framework to make an interesting story?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 17.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe. That's good.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 18.ogg Yae Miko: Okay, we're done with chapter one. Let's move on to chapter two.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 19.ogg Yae Miko: Readers will devour your content a lot more quickly than you'd think. If we don't keep delivering the goods now we've caught their attention, all our hard work so far is in vain.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 20.ogg Yae Miko: Hurry, chapter two, let's go. Can't you see that Satomi is waiting?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 21.ogg Yae Miko: What a pity... I thought your "beginner's luck" would carry you a little further before it came to this. But alas. The time has come prematurely.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 22.ogg Yae Miko: The bane of our existence: "writer's block." It's your arch-nemesis for life, appearing without warning and inflicting a pain worse than death upon the writer. They sell their souls just to get their muse back.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 23.ogg Yae Miko: When this happens, the best thing you can do is have a bite to eat and take a proper break.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 24.ogg Yae Miko: Boss, get me a plate of Fried Tofu! And get some Kushikatsu for these two. Just the basic kind will do.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 25.ogg Yae Miko: Don't worry, this is my treat.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 26.ogg Yae Miko: Of course, everyone that takes part in the creative process will be paid.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27a 1.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... I give it a 9.8!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27a 2.ogg Yae Miko: The story is fun and action-packed, with no dark undertones. Also, there are a great many legends about Rex Lapis. I'm sure it will spark the people's curiosity.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27a 3.ogg Yae Miko: I, for one, think there's a sizable market for this. Approved.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27b 1.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... I give it a 9.5!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27b 2.ogg Yae Miko: A classic tale of youth and friendship. It never gets old.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27b 3.ogg Yae Miko: I especially like the head of the club. Great character design. She really has rock 'n' roll coursing through her veins. I can almost feel the heat from that fire in her soul. Approved!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27c 1.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... I give it a 9.5!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27c 2.ogg Yae Miko: "Monster evolution" is an increasingly common theme these days. What started out as a rather niche genre has gradually worked its way into the mainstream.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27c 3.ogg Yae Miko: And I wouldn't worry about the continuity issue. All we have to do is explain at the beginning of the work that the protagonist can travel between different worlds. Or just explain it away as a dream.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 27c 4.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe... The most important thing is that it's fun. In light novels, as in life, having fun is the most important thing. Wouldn't you agree?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 28.ogg Yae Miko: Great, well, now Satomi can get started on that.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 29.ogg Yae Miko: Let's write about Inazuma in the third chapter, shall we? I can help with this one. We can use the Vision Hunt Decree or your experience in the resistance, any ideas?
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 30a 1.ogg Yae Miko: Mm, clearly very closely based on your own personal experience, with no major changes at all.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 30a 2.ogg Yae Miko: That's fine. Since it's something that took place in Inazuma, it might actually be more interesting to readers if it's grounded in the truth.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 30b.ogg Yae Miko: We can and we will! I think it's great!
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 30c.ogg Yae Miko: I think it's rather good. A lot of people still like the classic hero's journey. From ordinary soldier to great leader — a fresh take on a timeless classic.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 31.ogg Yae Miko: One thing though — we'll need to rewrite the part about me giving you the omamori.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 32.ogg Yae Miko: Let's change it to: "The mysterious Lady Kitsune teaches the protagonist a spell that can make their wishes come true. The protagonist uses this spell to defeat the Raiden Shogun in battle." That should do the trick.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 33.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, I suppose so. Once they're done writing the manuscript, I'll write the passage where the protagonist recites the incantation myself.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 34.ogg Yae Miko: The content is fine. Now we just need to promote it.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 35.ogg Yae Miko: I will contact an artist to make some illustrations — I'm positive they will be at least as good as those in "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits." We'll also need an endorsement on a paper band around the book. I can get the wonderful Ms. Hina to write that.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 36.ogg Yae Miko: She runs a regular Q&A column in "That's Life" magazine. The people of Inazuma absolutely adore her.
Media:vo ymlq002 3 yaemiko 37.ogg Yae Miko: You're free to take a break while the creative team is doing their work, but please go by the Yae Publishing House at some point to commission Ms. Hina for that recommendation. Once our light novel is complete, let's meet at the writers' submission event.
Media:vo ymlq002 4 kuroda 01.ogg Kuroda: Ms. Hina doesn't usually do endorsements. But since it's Lady Guuji that's asking, we'll see what we can do.
Media:vo ymlq002 4 kuroda 02.ogg Kuroda: With Ms. Hina getting so popular lately, a lot of people have come to us hoping to do a collaboration.
Media:vo ymlq002 4 kuroda 03.ogg Kuroda: But Ms. Hina's not interested in any of it. She still prefers to focus all her efforts on replying to readers' letters, and turns down every promotional opportunity she can.
Media:vo ymlq002 4 kuroda 04.ogg Kuroda: Maybe that's why her fans like her so much... Ahem, I'm getting off topic here. Anyway, if we can get that endorsement from Ms. Hina, you'll definitely get an exposure boost at the beginning.
Media:vo ymlq002 4 kuroda 05.ogg Kuroda: May your light novel sell well, and set a new record for the Yae Publishing House!
Media:vo ymlq002 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We'll do our best!
Media:vo ymlq002 5 nakanoshino 01.ogg Nakano Shino: Are you sure you'd like to submit this entry? Let me see, "The Miraculous Adventures of the Traveler," by "Thousand Hands."
Media:vo ymlq002 5 nakanoshino 02.ogg Nakano Shino: We'll get this printed as a matter of priority and conduct trial sales in pilot locations throughout Inazuma. I'll announce the sales numbers in three days.
Media:vo ymlq002 5 nakanoshino 03.ogg Nakano Shino: Okay, then I'll sign you up. Please come back in three days for the results.
Media:vo ymlq002 5 nakanoshino 04.ogg Nakano Shino: Thank you all for your submission. I wish you the very best of luck!
Media:vo ymlq002 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What a strange pen name... Definitely your doing. Having been around you so much recently, Paimon's slowly starting to understand your unique tastes.
Media:vo ymlq002 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh, Paimon's getting a little nervous now. D'you really think this is gonna work, (Traveler)?
Media:vo ymlq002 5 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: What do you mean, "strange"? It took a lot of work by a lot of different people to get this thing finished. Don't you think it's a very descriptive pen name?
Media:vo ymlq002 5 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: That's right, be confident in your work. That's exactly how a light novelist should be.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 kazumichi 01.ogg Kazumichi: Hey guys... have you heard about this latest kaidan thing doing the rounds? You just need to recite the incantation from "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" at midnight, and your wish will come true...
Media:vo ymlq002 7 kazumichi 02.ogg Kazumichi: "The Secret Spells of Lady Kitsune"? What's that?
Media:vo ymlq002 7 kazumichi 03.ogg Kazumichi: Really? Well I'd better go and prepare, too...
Media:vo ymlq002 7 kyouta 01.ogg Kyouta: Oh, that? Heh, that's a throwback. That's old news, man.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 kyouta 02.ogg Kyouta: No one's talking about that anymore. "The Secret Spells of Lady Kitsune" is the new hit thing. I've already memorized all the incantations.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 nakanoshino 01.ogg Nakano Shino: Ah, you've all finally made it.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 nakanoshino 02.ogg Nakano Shino: Good news, everyone. I just received word that your light novel is flying off the shelves! Multiple sales locations are asking when we'll be printing more copies.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 nakanoshino 03.ogg Nakano Shino: This level of success is an amazing accomplishment for a new work. Most new books don't sell 30% of what you've sold.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 nakanoshino 04.ogg Nakano Shino: I have free copies for each of you here, please take them. The payment will follow shortly, and I'll notify you to come and collect it when the time comes.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Woohoo, that's great!
Media:vo ymlq002 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, yeah! The whole reason why we made this light novel was to combat the influence of "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits."
Media:vo ymlq002 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm, we sold a lot of copies, but it doesn't feel like we accomplished our goal. How do we know whether it worked?
Media:vo ymlq002 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wow, you're right. Everyone's shifting focus!
Media:vo ymlq002 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: But what's this "moonless night" that they're talking about?
Media:vo ymlq002 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Paimon doesn't remember that detail from the brainstorming session.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Eh? There's a phase two?
Media:vo ymlq002 7 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Ohh, yeah! If we leave him to his own devices, he might just write another guide to summoning spirits.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: ...Also, we still need to figure out what his motive for writing it was!
Media:vo ymlq002 7 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: But the spirit that wrote the book has already left him now, right? So what are we supposed to do?
Media:vo ymlq002 7 tetsuo 01.ogg Tetsuo: You haven't read it yet? Okay, so, supposedly, if you recite the spell in there on a moonless night, you'll receive the protection of the kitsune and all the other powerful youkai. They can make any of your wishes come true!
Media:vo ymlq002 7 tetsuo 02.ogg Tetsuo: I heard that the incantations in "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" have weird side effects! This one guy wished for a load of Mora — and got it — but then one night, it all turned to leaves and he developed a high fever.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 tetsuo 03.ogg Tetsuo: They actually had to use one of "The Secret Spells of Lady Kitsune" to get rid of the discomfort.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 tetsuo 04.ogg Tetsuo: That proves that the incantations in this book are more potent than the ones everyone was trying before! Pretty much everyone I know is desperate to try it out — just waiting for a moonless night.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe... Oh, don't worry. The change is already underway.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: Shh... listen to what the people around us are talking about. The conversation has already moved on, hasn't it?
Media:vo ymlq002 7 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: Well? Feeling less worried now?
Media:vo ymlq002 7 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, this is something that will become very important to us further down the line. Alright, it's time to move on to the next phase of the plan.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 yaemiko 05.ogg Yae Miko: Of course. Behind every book that hits the market lies an author, right?
Media:vo ymlq002 7 yaemiko 06.ogg Yae Miko: Exactly, that's what we need to take care of next. Fortunately, I've already managed to identify the author — he's a failed light novelist named Tomoyuki.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 yaemiko 07.ogg Yae Miko: But when we went to ask him about it, he had no recollection whatsoever of having written the book.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 yaemiko 08.ogg Yae Miko: Yes, this is another case of possession — only this time, whoever possessed him actively sought him out.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 yaemiko 09.ogg Yae Miko: After his novel submission failed, he was walking aimlessly in Araumi. In frustration, he shouted out: "Please, someone, anyone! Help me write a truly amazing novel!" After that, he lost consciousness.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 yaemiko 10.ogg Yae Miko: Simple. It wrote a summoning incantation in the book, didn't it? So we can just use its own method to make it manifest itself.
Media:vo ymlq002 7 yaemiko 11.ogg Yae Miko: And you, my little friend, are the perfect candidate for this role. Hehehe...
Media:vo ymlq002 7 yaemiko 12.ogg Yae Miko: Aww, what are you talking about? The fun's just about to begin.
