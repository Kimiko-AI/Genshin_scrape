 As soon as you've done your knitting!
 Most of them look great.
 Nice job.
 Quest DescriptionYou meet up with Thoma again, and he brings the finished sweater.
 Some things even Thoma can't fix, huh?
 They're a pain in the butt.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Haha, you mean because they won't keep still?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: In their defense, they've not really had proper training. It's natural for them to want to move around.
 They're super cute.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: I'll have to think carefully about what kind of sweaters to knit for each of them.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: The colors should be complementary... Hmm... Well you know what? Let's buy some yarn from the next store we pass.
 Yep, see you next time!
Media:vo tmcop001 1911602 thoma 23.ogg Thoma: Ahh, they're so cute... Come on, let's take some photos, (Traveler).
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: *yawn* So sleepy...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: I had some things I needed to do, so I ended up burning the midnight oil to get those sweaters knitted.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: I wonder if they'll actually suit them though... Hmm, let's start by testing them out on the friendlier ones, (Traveler).
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: This one's for Petal, this one's for Darko, and this one's for Goldilocks...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: With any luck, that should see them through the winter.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Then, come the spring, a new year will begin...
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: ...and they'll be free to roam the wilds once again.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: You know, if you take one day at a time and be kind to the world, good things will come your way eventually.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: That might sound a bit naive, but I really do believe it.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911801 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: At least... it seems to have worked for me, you know?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Well, I think we've got enough photos now.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: I can't get over how cute they are! They're just adorable, aren't they, (Traveler)?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: I'll have to think carefully about what kind of sweaters to knit for each of them.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: The colors should be complementary... Hmm... Well you know what? Let's buy some yarn from the next store we pass.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Haha, you mean because they won't keep still?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: In their defense, they've not really had proper training. It's natural for them to want to move around.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: You know, the first time I came here, there was just one stray dog on its own.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: I still remember the first time I fed it. It was a rainy day.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: The Kamisato Clan had just introduced a series of new policies, but a few of the more stubborn clan elders were extremely resistant to the changes.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: I was holding my umbrella, on my way to visit one such gentleman of senior status. The plan was to talk him into supporting the clan's decision.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 11.ogg Thoma: Sadly, he wasn't interested in having a conversation — he didn't even let me in. As soon as he saw me coming, he got his samurai to send me away.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 12.ogg Thoma: I mean, I fixed it in the end of course. It's just that the first few visits didn't go so smoothly.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 13.ogg Thoma: So anyway, after they turned me away, the weather went from bad to worse. The wind was so strong it rendered my umbrella completely useless... Before long, I was drenched from head to toe — I must have looked like a real mess.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 14.ogg Thoma: I decided to take shelter under a tree, and found a stray dog sitting there who had the same idea as me.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 15.ogg Thoma: It saw me and moved a little further in, like it was trying to make room for me.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 16.ogg Thoma: So, we sat there together. I shared my Onigiri with it — stone cold by this point, but still edible — and we ended up huddling together, waiting for the rain to stop.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 17.ogg Thoma: As far as the big shots are concerned, I'm just an expendable servant boy. I always have to be mindful about what they might want, and what I can do for them in return.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 18.ogg Thoma: But when I'm with these little guys and gals, everything's so much simpler. One stone-cold Onigiri, and hey presto. We're friends for life.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 19.ogg Thoma: Even when I show up empty-handed, they still come to me. When it comes down to it, I think it's these simple and straightforward connections that I value the most.
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 20.ogg Thoma: Sorry, ended up giving you the unabridged version! Shall we come visit this place again some other time?
Media:vo tmcop001 1911802 thoma 21.ogg Thoma: Great. I'll see you soon!
You dress the stray cats and dogs in sweaters with Thoma.
