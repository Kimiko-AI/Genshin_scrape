 ...
 I will gladly join you.
 I'm not going back until I can call him my sensei.
 Quest DescriptionThe swordmaster who aimed to be the greatest under heaven descended into madness after losing his Vision. You decide to help his disciples investigate the cause...
 We can wait till he's recovered.
 We're here to become disciples.
 Why did you run?
 Yes, it seems as good of a resolution as we can hope for.
(Junya leaves for now. As you wait, you witness an unfamiliar, suspicious figure pass by in a flash.)
Media:vo dialog dqaq007 junya 01.ogg Junya: Sensei will be fine, I'm sure of it. He's a strong person.
Media:vo dialog dqaq007 nanako 01.ogg Nanako: *sigh* I just hope Sensei doesn't have to endure this much longer...
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 01.ogg Junya: Nanako, don't worry! Sensei will be fine...
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 02.ogg Junya: Those thugs that challenged the dojo were strong, but he fought them all off in the end, didn't he?
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 03.ogg Junya: It's just because he's been possessed, that's all! Once the exorcism has taken place, he'll be right as rain in no time.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 04.ogg Junya: ...Who are you?
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 05.ogg Junya: I don't care whether you're trespassers or just here to harass us while Sensei is impaired — get out of here immediately!
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 06.ogg Junya: Don't make me draw my blade, or you won't live to regret it!
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 07.ogg Junya: ...Disciples?
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 08.ogg Junya: Hmm... From the way you're dressed... it doesn't look like you're from around here.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 09.ogg Junya: Please accept my apologies... We've had so many people trying to cause us trouble recently that we're on high alert.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 10.ogg Junya: You haven't arrived at the best of times, I'm afraid. Sensei got possessed recently, and he's still recovering. He's not able to take on any new disciples for the time being.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 11.ogg Junya: I see you are earnest in your pursuit. *sigh* Okay, how about this — my fellow disciple Nanako and I will explain Sensei's situation to you in a little more detail. Then you can decide whether to stay or to leave.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 12.ogg Junya: Sensei's name is Domon, a name I'm sure you've already heard.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 13.ogg Junya: Though self-taught, he mastered the art of the sword to a high level. He then proceeded to defeat many other prominent swordmasters, never losing a single fight.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 14.ogg Junya: He once said that his goal was to become the best swordmaster in the world.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 15.ogg Junya: And so, even while training us, he continued to hone his own art. His fervor truly inspired us, and we trained hard, determined to keep up with him.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 16.ogg Junya: But then...
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 17.ogg Junya: You haven't heard of it? It's the largest shrine on Narukami Island. The head shrine maiden is reputed to have very close ties with the Almighty Shogun herself.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 18.ogg Junya: Not that we'd have any means of involving the head shrine maiden, of course... But even one of the ordinary shrine maidens from the Grand Narukami Shrine would have clear power and authority to perform an exorcism.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 19.ogg Junya: So don't worry, Nanako. Sensei is going to be just fine.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 junya 20.ogg Junya: The exorcism will take place this evening. You're both more than welcome to come and watch if you're interested.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 nanako 01.ogg Nanako: Maybe, but I'm still worried about him...
Media:vo dqaq007 1 nanako 02.ogg Nanako: Things have gotten dangerous before in the past, but it's never shaken him. This time, though... *sigh*
Media:vo dqaq007 1 nanako 03.ogg Nanako: Not long ago, Sensei had his Vision taken away. He hasn't been the same since.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 nanako 04.ogg Nanako: He says the strangest things over and over, and he refuses to let us train...
Media:vo dqaq007 1 nanako 05.ogg Nanako: Junya and I have discussed it, and we both think that he's been possessed by an evil spirit. So, we've asked the shrine maidens from the Grand Narukami Shrine to perform an exorcism.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 nanako 06.ogg Nanako: But if I'm honest... I still have my doubts over whether he'll completely recover...
Media:vo dqaq007 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: The third person who had their Vision taken is supposed to be a famous swordmaster around these parts.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon heard that he's the present-day master of Meikyou Shisui Art... sounds pretty impressive...
Media:vo dqaq007 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: This is his dojo, luckily there's some people around. Let's go talk to them.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hey there... did something happen?
Media:vo dqaq007 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: N—No, you got us all wrong! We just came here to... uhh...
Media:vo dqaq007 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Yup yup! We've heard all about the mighty master of Meikyou Shisui Art. It's the whole reason we came all this way — to seek him out and ask him to train us.
Media:vo dqaq007 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: But then we got here and overheard you talking about how he got possessed, or something...
Media:vo dqaq007 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: The Grand Narukami Shrine? What's that?
Media:vo dqaq007 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: So... losing your Vision can cause possession? Uh, guess we should come back this evening and see for ourselves.
Media:vo dqaq007 2 junya 01.ogg Junya: Shh... So, you decided to come? It's a good thing you didn't arrive any earlier — you would have had to witness Sensei in one of his fits of madness.
Media:vo dqaq007 2 junya 02.ogg Junya: Just now, when Nanako was attending to him, she heard him whispering a few names to himself.
Media:vo dqaq007 2 junya 03.ogg Junya: When she asked him who the people were, he suddenly looked panic-stricken and pushed her away.
Media:vo dqaq007 2 junya 04.ogg Junya: It looked like he was in great distress... He was covering his ears and looking frantically around him with bloodshot eyes.
Media:vo dqaq007 2 junya 05.ogg Junya: All the while he kept calling those names — some of them we knew, others we didn't recognize, but they all seemed to be the names of swordmasters he had defeated in the past.
Media:vo dqaq007 2 junya 06.ogg Junya: One of them was Anzai. He used to be a fellow disciple of Sensei's, his senior, in fact. But Sensei defeated him in a duel many years ago, and he has been a wanderer ever since.
Media:vo dqaq007 2 junya 07.ogg Junya: Sensei wouldn't stop calling his name... *sigh* Thankfully, the shrine maidens managed to subdue him, so the exorcism can finally continue.
Media:vo dqaq007 2 junya 08.ogg Junya: The ritual has now begun — all we can do is patiently await the result. Here's hoping Sensei will be back to his normal self very soon.
Media:vo dqaq007 2 junya 09.ogg Junya: Please excuse me for a moment while I fetch some water. If he wakes up, he is sure to be thirsty.
Media:vo dqaq007 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: ...Huh?
Media:vo dqaq007 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Who's that sneaking around? Uh-oh... could they be here to mess up the exorcism?
Media:vo dqaq007 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We won't let them get away with it! Come on, let's go after them!
Media:vo dqaq007 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hmm, seems they aren't here... should we keep going further up?
Media:vo dqaq007 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Is this definitely the right place? Let's look a little further up.
Media:vo dqaq007 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Aha! Suspicious person sighted— that's gotta be him!
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 01.ogg ???: How... How did you... catch up with me... so quickly...
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 02.ogg ???: Are you sure you're Domon's disciples? You move even quicker than he does...
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 03.ogg ???: Unless... I guess it's been a few years. Maybe his skills have improved again?
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 04.ogg ???: Bad news? Hmph. I'll have you know I trained side-by-side with Domon back in the day — long before you ever showed up.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 05.ogg ???: I don't care to talk about that time anymore... but if you must know, I am Domon's senior.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 06.ogg Anzai: Anzai. Yes, that's me.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 07.ogg Anzai: Because I don't wish to see Domon, or anyone else associated with him, ever again.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 08.ogg Anzai: When we were young, we trained under the same swordmaster, studying Meikyou Shisui Art together.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 09.ogg Anzai: I had begun training five years before him, and everyone looked up to me as a steady and dependable older disciple.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 10.ogg Anzai: Practitioners of Meikyou Shisui Art seek to achieve "stillness of mind, freedom from all agitation."So the majority of disciples are indifferent to rank and reward. I was no exception.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 11.ogg Anzai: But Domon was different. The first thing he did when he joined was go straight to our sensei and ask him, with a beaming smile on his face, how to become the best in the world.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 12.ogg Anzai: Sensei scolded him, and told him that the art of the sword should not be used for such vain ends. Sensei said that coveting the title of the best swordmaster, barely days into his training, showed that he had a fickle mind, and that this would impede him from ever mastering the blade.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 13.ogg Anzai: I thought so too, at the time... But Domon began making swift progress in his training, and even started catching up with me.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 14.ogg Anzai: Only then did I realize that it was Domon who had long since freed his mind from all agitation.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 15.ogg Anzai: He was consumed by his singular desire to become the best in the world. He sought nothing less than perfection in the art of the sword, and nothing could deter him from this goal, no matter what stood in his way.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 16.ogg Anzai: Because until he arrived, I was convinced that I would succeed our sensei as the master of Meikyou Shisui Art.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 17.ogg Anzai: Of all the disciples, I was the most gifted — I had trained the longest. Everyone had high expectations for me.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 18.ogg Anzai: Domon's arrival changed everything. When we sparred, I lost not just the match, but my pride and my status, too. I fled the dojo that day and never looked back.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 19.ogg Anzai: Later, I heard that he sparred with Sensei, too. Sensei was advanced in years by then, and unfortunately, that match used up every last ounce of energy in his body...
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 20.ogg Anzai: After that, I wanted nothing further to do with him. Deep down, though, I still respected his mastery of the blade, and his commitment to the art of the sword.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 21.ogg Anzai: So when I heard rumors that he had lost his mind, my first reaction was to dismiss them as false. How could he, of all people, have lost his mind? His mind was the sharpest of them all — he had practiced Meikyou Shisui Art to perfection.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 22.ogg Anzai: I decided to quietly come and see if it were true. Then, to my complete astonishment, I heard him call my name... I thought mine was a name he had long since forgotten.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 23.ogg Anzai: So you see — I came here not to cause him any harm. I just wanted to see for myself.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 anzai 24.ogg Anzai: ...Okay, you've heard my story. You should get back now — the exorcism is probably finishing.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Um, excuse me! We're the ones asking the questions here! First off, who are you?
Media:vo dqaq007 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: And what are you doing, sneaking around these parts, hmm? You seem like bad news, mister!
Media:vo dqaq007 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: His senior? Wait, that means you must be...
Media:vo dqaq007 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Sure sounds like he meant business... So, how come you don't want to ever see him again?
Media:vo dqaq007 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Seems like we got it wrong this time. He wasn't here to mess up the exorcism at all.
Media:vo dqaq007 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Still, Paimon's not sure we should bring him back with us... Uh, let's go see how the exorcism's coming along!
Media:vo dqaq007 4 inagihotomi 01.ogg Inagi Hotomi: I am sorry. With what powers I have, I can find no sign of any malignant spirit having possessed Domon.
Media:vo dqaq007 4 inagihotomi 02.ogg Inagi Hotomi: But spirits may take a myriad of forms in this world, many of which I cannot claim to have witnessed myself. Thus, I dare not rule out possession with complete certainty.
Media:vo dqaq007 4 inagihotomi 03.ogg Inagi Hotomi: And all is certainly not lost, for I received word not long ago that Lady Yae has taken an interest in your sensei's case.
Media:vo dqaq007 4 inagihotomi 04.ogg Inagi Hotomi: Correct. Lady Yae is most knowledgeable indeed, and has abundant experience in the exorcism of evil spirits and aversion of great calamities.
Media:vo dqaq007 4 inagihotomi 05.ogg Inagi Hotomi: I am unable to say for certain whether an evil spirit has possessed your sensei, but Lady Yae can give a conclusive verdict.
Media:vo dqaq007 4 inagihotomi 06.ogg Inagi Hotomi: That won't be necessary. All that is required of you is your timely arrival at the Grand Narukami Shrine. Lady Yae does not like to be kept waiting.
Media:vo dqaq007 4 inagihotomi 07.ogg Inagi Hotomi: I must leave now, but we will meet soon at the shrine. I wish Domon a full and speedy recovery.
Media:vo dqaq007 4 junya 01.ogg Junya: Nanako, please, try not to get agitated...
Media:vo dqaq007 4 junya 02.ogg Junya: L—Lady Yae? Is that... the same Lady Yae that I think you mean?
Media:vo dqaq007 4 junya 03.ogg Junya: Excuse me, Miss Inagi, but I must ask. Should we prepare a greeting gift for Lady Yae?
Media:vo dqaq007 4 junya 04.ogg Junya: Who'd have thought Lady Yae herself would have taken notice of our sensei's case...
Media:vo dqaq007 4 junya 05.ogg Junya: No, no, that's not what I meant at all! You misunderstand me.
Media:vo dqaq007 4 junya 06.ogg Junya: I just mean... this is Lady Yae, the head shrine maiden! She has direct and close contact with the Almighty Shogun herself!
Media:vo dqaq007 4 junya 07.ogg Junya: Ahem. Anyway, you should join us too, tomorrow.
Media:vo dqaq007 4 junya 08.ogg Junya: Given that you've traveled all this way just to meet our sensei, we the disciples of Meikyou Shisui Art will do our best to help you.
Media:vo dqaq007 4 nanako 01.ogg Nanako: What? You're saying he isn't possessed?
Media:vo dqaq007 4 nanako 02.ogg Nanako: Does that mean he's just lost his mind? But how is that possible? ...No, I refuse to believe it. Something's clearly wrong!
Media:vo dqaq007 4 nanako 03.ogg Nanako: The head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine? That's wonderful news! Then Sensei will be sure to recover...
Media:vo dqaq007 4 nanako 04.ogg Nanako: Do you mean to say that Sensei isn't renowned enough to deserve Lady Yae's attention?
Media:vo dqaq007 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Sure! After all, everyone seems pretty excited about Lady Yae. We're curious to meet her, too.
Media:vo dqaq007 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Who knows, maybe we'll be able to find out a thing or two about the Raiden Shogun from her...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 anzai 01.ogg Anzai: That's enough!
Media:vo dqaq007 5 anzai 02.ogg Anzai: You're right to assume that my feelings towards you are far from kindly. *sigh* But I didn't come here to settle a score.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 anzai 03.ogg Anzai: It's been so long now that I made peace with it years ago. You did nothing wrong that day, I just... I couldn't face the humiliation. That's why I ran.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 anzai 04.ogg Anzai: I don't think most of the people you beat along the way would hold it against you. On the contrary, when you cut our ambitions short, we entrusted them to you, in the hope that they might carry you further.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 anzai 05.ogg Anzai: Now, I know that we can't place our hopes in you any longer, since you've been stripped of your ambitions, too...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 anzai 06.ogg Anzai: But that is no reason to strip them of theirs! "Follow the way of the sword all the way to the highest peak."You taught them that, didn't you?
Media:vo dqaq007 5 anzai 07.ogg Anzai: ...Have you asked them what they think?
Media:vo dqaq007 5 anzai 08.ogg Anzai: You see? You can place the ambition you once had in their hands.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 anzai 09.ogg Anzai: Being stripped of your ambition is something that's never happened to me, so I can't claim to understand it. But I do know what it feels like to have your ambitions crushed... that's what happened on the day that you so effortlessly defeated me.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 anzai 10.ogg Anzai: So, just as I once placed my ambitions onto you, it is time for you to release yours into their custody.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 anzai 11.ogg Anzai: You are not in the same position that I was. When I left, I had nothing to my name, but you have a great number of worthy disciples.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 anzai 12.ogg Anzai: You can count on that. I'd be checking in on you occasionally anyway, just to make sure you hadn't lost your mind again...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 anzai 13.ogg Anzai: But I am now used to the life of a wanderer. I do not belong in the dojo anymore. So I will simply stop by once in a while to make sure you aren't cutting any corners with them.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 anzai 14.ogg Anzai: Well, don't just stand there staring at me. Say thank you to Lady Yae and then get yourself back home.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 domon 01.ogg Domon: Keep away... Keep away from me...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 domon 02.ogg Domon: I gave up the art of the sword... Please, let me go, I beg you...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 domon 03.ogg Domon: I'm sorry... It's all my fault...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 domon 04.ogg Domon: Father, Sensei... Anzai...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 domon 05.ogg Domon: Anzai... Why are there two of you...? Is that you, or a ghost?
Media:vo dqaq007 5 domon 06.ogg Domon: You're here for revenge, aren't you... I knew it would come... I never should have—
Media:vo dqaq007 5 domon 07.ogg Domon: But, what if one day... the same thing happens to them...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 domon 08.ogg Domon: I put everything I had into trying to become the best... but what if it was all a huge mistake, right from the start?
Media:vo dqaq007 5 domon 09.ogg Domon: If there's a chance they'll end up like me one day, I'd rather they stay where they are now than go any further down this path...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 domon 10.ogg Domon: Goodness... Well, I...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 domon 11.ogg Domon: I... I understand.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 domon 12.ogg Domon: I am sorry to have made you worry for me and for the state of Meikyou Shisui Art.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 domon 13.ogg Domon: I no longer have the resolve to become the best in the world... the emptiness and suffering inside of me will not abate, so I cannot hope to still my mind and be free of agitation.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 domon 14.ogg Domon: But as your sensei, I shall commit to imparting unto you everything I have learned in my life so far.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 domon 15.ogg Domon: This is my promise, and I humbly ask Anzai, my senior, to hold me to my word.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 inagihotomi 01.ogg Inagi Hotomi: As you can see, Lady Yae.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 inagihotomi 02.ogg Inagi Hotomi: Domon has persisted in this state for some time now. He appears to see those who have lost to him in duels past, gathered all around him to persecute him.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 inagihotomi 03.ogg Inagi Hotomi: Traveler, a moment, please. Lady Yae has some words for you.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 junya 01.ogg Junya: Stripped of his ambition...? But, Lady Yae, even without his ambition, why should he suffer such a dramatic change? How does that explain his descent into madness?
Media:vo dqaq007 5 junya 02.ogg Junya: Nanako's far from the only one... Actually, all of us think that way.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 nanako 01.ogg Nanako: Lady Yae, it must be a possession... right?
Media:vo dqaq007 5 nanako 02.ogg Nanako: This is nothing like him at all. In the past, no matter what came his way, he would always face it with a confident smile.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 nanako 03.ogg Nanako: But... Then, d—does that mean he...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 nanako 04.ogg Nanako: Lady Yae... I'm not sure I understand...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 nanako 05.ogg Nanako: Poor Sensei... To think he's been suffering so greatly...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 nanako 06.ogg Nanako: Sensei... After you rescued me from the hands of the pirates, I told myself I would follow in your footsteps for the rest of my days.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 nanako 07.ogg Nanako: I can't know whether I will suffer in my future as you do now. All I know is that here and now, in the present, I wish to continue.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 nanako 08.ogg Nanako: I want to keep going until the day that I can stand before everyone with my head held high and announce that I, like my sensei Domon before me, am a master of Meikyou Shisui Art!
Media:vo dqaq007 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: D—D'you think that's Lady Yae...? No wonder Junya was so excited... she has a really striking presence...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Also, is it just Paimon, or did she look right at us just now?
Media:vo dqaq007 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: ...Eh, it was probably nothing... It's not like she's ever seen us before.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? Isn't that Anzai? Where'd he come from?
Media:vo dqaq007 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Did he follow us the whole way here?
Media:vo dqaq007 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: So, even though his ambition was taken away, his disciples can take it over on his behalf. Guess that sorta solves this one, huh?
Media:vo dqaq007 5 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Ooh, Lady Yae seems to have taken a real interest in you.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: She seems super mysterious... Paimon's so curious what she really meant by all of that...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Hmm, we can come back to it another time. For now, we should go report back to Miss Kamisato.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: ...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: I am sorry. It is clear to me that your sensei is not possessed by any evil spirit.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm, yes. This is a change in the person himself.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: Unable to cope with the tremendous pressure he was under, he suffered a spiritual collapse. With his wits impaired, he finally descended into madness.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 yaemiko 05.ogg Yae Miko: As one who is thrown into the sea, though he fights back desperately against his predicament, it does nothing to prevent his descent into the depths.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 yaemiko 06.ogg Yae Miko: As for what has triggered this change, I believe it must be the loss of his Vision. For to be stripped of one's Vision is to be stripped of one's ambition.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 yaemiko 07.ogg Yae Miko: Your school practices Meikyou Shisui Art, does it not?
Media:vo dqaq007 5 yaemiko 08.ogg Yae Miko: "Stillness of mind, freedom from all agitation"... What a fine notion that would be, if any in this world could ever hope to achieve it...
Media:vo dqaq007 5 yaemiko 09.ogg Yae Miko: There was once one who claimed to be indifferent to rank and reward, and who fled enraged when defeated by his junior. And then there was an aged swordmaster who was aggrieved enough that he crossed blades with a disciple he himself had taught.
Media:vo dqaq007 5 yaemiko 10.ogg Yae Miko: Then, what of the one who crossed blades with his own sensei and beloved fellow disciple, and defeated them both? Can one truly remain unagitated, of still mind, in moments such as these?
Media:vo dqaq007 5 yaemiko 11.ogg Yae Miko: The path of the swordmaster is filled with twists and turns. It is no small undertaking to pursue the position of greatest swordmaster in the world.
