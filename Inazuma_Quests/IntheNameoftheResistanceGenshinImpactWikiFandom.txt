 Be sure you do the same.
Media:vo dqaq010 1 thoma 10a.ogg Thoma: Don't worry about me, I can remain hidden when I want to. I won't make it easy for them.
 I accept.
 I should head off right away.
Media:vo dqaq010 1 thoma 10b.ogg Thoma: Me too, well, I should probably head inside the teahouse now. I'll see you when I see you, whenever that is... In the meantime, stay safe.
 I won't lose.
 It was me.
 It's my duty as a member of the resistance!
 Let me tell you about the seizure of the 100th Vision...
 Long live the resistance!
 No immediate plans...
 No.
 Of course you can come.
 Okay, but watch closely.
 Quest DescriptionYour first meeting with the Raiden Shogun leads to a clash beyond your expectations. With a warrant out for you, your only option to reverse the situation now is to throw your lot in with the Sangonomiya resistance.
 Sure, but pay attention this time.
 Sure.
 We're here to help!
 What do you need us to do?
 Yes.
 You got it!
(Upon arriving at the location)
Beidou: I just hope you can afford all these mercs you've gathered
Cutscene's Archive Summary:
The cries of battle rise high into the sky. The resistance is at a disadvantage, leaving Gorou fretful and frustrated. Just then, the core of the resistance, Sangonomiya Kokomi, appears like timely rain from the heavens. The reinforcements who have long lain in ambush emerge and charge at her signal, flooding over the battlefield, with Beidou and Kazuha in their midst serving as mercenaries. Seeing that the moment has passed, Kujou Sara is forced to order a retreat
Destroy a certain number of Blue Targets to complete the training exercise. Watch out, though! Hitting the Red Targets that represent allied forces or leaving the training area will result in failure.
Gorou: *nods*
Gorou: Her Excellency!
Gorou: Kazuha!
Gorou: Stand firm, hold the line!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Heh, calm as the breeze, my lady
Kaedehara Kazuha: We meet again, old friend
Kujou Sara: Now!
Kujou Sara: Tch... All forces, retreat!
Media:vo dialog dqaq010 beidou 01.ogg Beidou: I guarantee you, only the Alcor could pull off an ambush as quietly as that.
Media:vo dialog dqaq010 beidou 02.ogg Beidou: Did we give you a fright? I gotta admit, I was caught off guard myself. When we dropped you off in Ritou, I wasn't expecting Tatarasuna would be the next place I'd see you.
Media:vo dialog dqaq010 beidou 03.ogg Beidou: But wherever you might end up, you'll always be part of Captain Beidou's crew.
Media:vo dialog dqaq010 beidou 04.ogg Beidou: If you're ever in a tight spot, come and find me. I'll have your back.
Media:vo dialog dqaq010 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Her Excellency never fails us!
Media:vo dialog dqaq010 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: I must say, I was certainly surprised to look out and see Kazuha joining the fray. It's been quite some time since we last fought side-by-side...
Media:vo dialog dqaq010 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: At that time, his friend was defeated in a duel before the throne... and executed by the Raiden Shogun. Kazuha came to visit the resistance as he was fleeing Inazuma with his friend's Vision.
Media:vo dialog dqaq010 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: ...Hard to believe it's been so long.
Media:vo dialog dqaq010 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: On the way here, I happened to learn of the bounty on your head. Hehe, as expected, you seem to have given them quite the challenge in that regard.
Media:vo dialog dqaq010 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I hear also that you witnessed the Raiden Shogun? I trust she's as oppressive as ever.
Media:vo dialog dqaq010 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: The Musou no Hitotachi... Are there truly those who can withstand it?
Media:vo dialog dqaq010 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Perhaps one day, we will be able to face her oppression head-on... This is the reason I returned to Inazuma.
Media:vo dialog dqaq010 masashi 01.ogg Masashi: No one wants the Vision Hunt Decree. The resistance will be victorious!
Media:vo dialog dqaq010 tokuda 01.ogg Tokuda: I wonder when I'll finally be back on the front line...
Media:vo dqaq009 1 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Yikes! Hide — quick!
Media:vo dqaq009 1 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Oh no — run!
Media:vo dqaq009 1 soldier 01.ogg Patrol Officer: Stop! I have orders to search for a wanted criminal!
Media:vo dqaq009 1 soldier 02.ogg Patrol Officer: You! The warrant is for your arrest! Freeze!
Media:vo dqaq010 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wh—Why have we stopped here?
Media:vo dqaq010 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon's pretty sure Ayaka mentioned them before... Oh yeah! Sangonomiya's group! The ones who came together to fight the Vision Hunt Decree!
Media:vo dqaq010 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We gotta hurry up, the Tenryou Commission could be right around the corner!
Media:vo dqaq010 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Let's get outta here!
Media:vo dqaq010 1 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: In case you've forgotten, the Komore Teahouse is the safest place for me to hide in this area.
Media:vo dqaq010 1 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: The only thing is, I probably won't be able to leave again for some time. I'll have to leave the next steps to you.
Media:vo dqaq010 1 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Go to Tatarasuna and find the resistance.
Media:vo dqaq010 1 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: The Shogun's Army is almost certainly about to issue a warrant for our arrest. There are very few parties that will be willing to shelter us... but the resistance is an exception.
Media:vo dqaq010 1 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: That's right. The resistance was founded by Sangonomiya Kokomi, the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island. Currently, it's her subordinate, Gorou, who leads them in their war against the Shogun's Army.
Media:vo dqaq010 1 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: However, the Yashiro Commission is not on especially close terms with the resistance. So your dealings with us would normally be frowned upon.
Media:vo dqaq010 1 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: But you're different, so that shouldn't work against you... As far as I can see, the resistance shouldn't have any reason to turn you away.
Media:vo dqaq010 1 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: The only issue is that we can't be sure of the resistance forces' current location. You'll have to ask around along the way.
Media:vo dqaq010 1 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: You'll likely pass through territory occupied by the Shogun's Army at some point. So, be sure to stay on your guard at all times.
Media:vo dqaq010 1 thoma 10a.ogg Thoma: Don't worry about me, I can remain hidden when I want to. I won't make it easy for them.
Media:vo dqaq010 1 thoma 10b.ogg Thoma: Me too, well, I should probably head inside the teahouse now. I'll see you when I see you, whenever that is... In the meantime, stay safe.
Media:vo dqaq010 10 hisahiko 01.ogg Hisahiko: Bullseye?
Media:vo dqaq010 10 hisahiko 02.ogg Hisahiko: *sigh* This isn't good enough. It's evident from these past few days that practice alone isn't enough to improve our marksmanship.
Media:vo dqaq010 10 hisahiko 03.ogg Hisahiko: How hard could it be? Just draw the bow, aim, and shoot. Clearly I underestimated the skill involved...
Media:vo dqaq010 10 hisahiko 04.ogg Hisahiko: With progress like this, who know when we'll be fit for battle. I suppose all we can do for now is wait for the drillmaster's next visit and ask him for more tips.
Media:vo dqaq010 10 hisahiko 05.ogg Hisahiko: It would mean a lot!
Media:vo dqaq010 10 shouji 01.ogg Shouji: *sigh* Another miss. This sucks...
Media:vo dqaq010 10 shouji 02.ogg Shouji: Let's see now... I've loosed exactly ten arrows, and only one—
Media:vo dqaq010 10 shouji 03.ogg Shouji: ...Only one hit the target.
Media:vo dqaq010 10 shouji 04.ogg Shouji: Seems things have gotten tough on the front line recently. All the best drillmasters have already been dispatched to fight.
Media:vo dqaq010 10 shouji 05.ogg Shouji: I guess we'll just have to keep practicing ourselves. *sigh* At this rate, who knows if we'll ever become resistance fighters...
Media:vo dqaq010 10 shouji 06.ogg Shouji: ...Teppei senpai?
Media:vo dqaq010 10 shouji 07.ogg Shouji: I—Is that true...? Uh... p—perhaps you'll be willing to give us some... archery tips?
Media:vo dqaq010 10 shouji 08.ogg Shouji: We promise not to take too much of your time. A quick demonstration would be all we need. Our previous training was so rushed that we hardly remember the proper technique.
Media:vo dqaq010 10 shouji 09.ogg Shouji: Oh! Y—You got it! We won't let you down.
Destroy a certain number of Blue Targets to complete the training exercise. Watch out, though! Hitting the Red Targets that represent allied forces or leaving the training area will result in failure.
Media:vo dqaq010 10 teppei 01.ogg Teppei: C'mon guys! Less complaining, more training...
Media:vo dqaq010 10 teppei 02.ogg Teppei: Listen up for a second. I've come to introduce our newest recruit.
Media:vo dqaq010 10 teppei 03a.ogg Media:vo dqaq010 10 teppei 03b.ogg Teppei: In battle, (he/she) single-handedly slayed multiple Shogunate Samurai without so much as breaking a sweat.
Media:vo dqaq010 10 teppei 04.ogg Teppei: And that was after interrupting the Vision Hunt Ceremony with a feat of stunning bravery, not to mention surviving an encounter with the Raiden Shogun!
Media:vo dqaq010 10 teppei 05.ogg Teppei: Aha, pressure getting to you?
Media:vo dqaq010 10 teppei 06.ogg Teppei: That's no way to demonstrate. Come on, try again.
Media:vo dqaq010 10 teppei 07.ogg Teppei: Let's go — show us what you got!
Media:vo dqaq010 10 teppei 08.ogg Teppei: Ready?
Media:vo dqaq010 10 teppei 09.ogg Teppei: I'm sure you'll get it this time. Swiftly, now!
Media:vo dqaq010 11 hisahiko 01.ogg Hisahiko: Those "few," huh?
Media:vo dqaq010 11 hisahiko 02.ogg Hisahiko: Watching your demonstration was a great help. I learned a lot.
Media:vo dqaq010 11 hisahiko 03.ogg Hisahiko: At least this time I was able to observe some proper technique. As long as I can retain it, I know I'll become much stronger.
Media:vo dqaq010 11 hisahiko 04.ogg Hisahiko: Honestly, before this whole conflict came about, I was just another everyday citizen of Watatsumi Island.
Media:vo dqaq010 11 hisahiko 05.ogg Hisahiko: My wife and I were leading a quiet life together. War and battles were the last things on our minds. That all changed with the Vision Hunt Decree...
Media:vo dqaq010 11 hisahiko 06.ogg Hisahiko: The actions of the Shogun's Army ignited something inside me — that's why I joined the resistance. The road ahead of us now seems like a long one indeed.
Media:vo dqaq010 11 hisahiko 07.ogg Hisahiko: Can those of us without Visions or combat skills really become adept fighters like them...?
Media:vo dqaq010 11 hisahiko 08.ogg Hisahiko: ...There's no use in speculating. Thank you both for your help, we'll keep practicing as much as we can.
Media:vo dqaq010 11 message-runner 01.ogg Message-Runner: Sir! We've got trouble! The Shogun's Army is attacking!
Media:vo dqaq010 11 message-runner 02.ogg Message-Runner: There are still many wounded in the camp — we mustn't let the enemy break through! We'll need your help to hold them off!
Media:vo dqaq010 11 shouji 01.ogg Shouji: Incredible! I think I understand what I was doing wrong now.
Media:vo dqaq010 11 shouji 02.ogg Shouji: My posture was off and I didn't draw back with enough force. Seems I also need to focus on keeping my grip steady and monitoring the external environment. If I can get those few down, I'll be hitting my mark in no time!
Media:vo dqaq010 11 teppei 01.ogg Teppei: Well, there you have it. I told you our latest recruit is pretty strong.
Media:vo dqaq010 11 teppei 02.ogg Teppei: Stay focused. With us holding the front line, you can continue sharpening your skills until you're ready.
Media:vo dqaq010 11 teppei 03.ogg Teppei: Now then, let me show you around some other places.
Media:vo dqaq010 11 teppei 04.ogg Teppei: Where should we head next...
Media:vo dqaq010 11 teppei 05.ogg Teppei: What? Impossible! How could they have reached us all the way out here...
Media:vo dqaq010 11 teppei 06.ogg Teppei: We'd better go assess the situation. A chance for us to prove our worth in battle!
Media:vo dqaq010 12 message-runner 01.ogg Message-Runner: Sir, if I may...
Media:vo dqaq010 12 message-runner 02.ogg Message-Runner: I just returned from inspecting the perimeter. It appears that several portions of our defensive walls were already collapsed.
Media:vo dqaq010 12 message-runner 03.ogg Message-Runner: The Shogun's Army must have known about this vulnerability and made their way over from the cliffs nearby, before attacking through the gaps in our defenses.
Media:vo dqaq010 12 message-runner 04.ogg Message-Runner: I suggest we repair the walls and double the guard. That should keep them from sneaking up on us like this again.
Media:vo dqaq010 12 teppei 01.ogg Teppei: Well, we managed to hold them off... But what would the Shogun's Army be doing here?
Media:vo dqaq010 12 teppei 02.ogg Teppei: We have sentries and patrols posted all around the perimeter here. The enemy should never have been able to reach us this far unnoticed.
Media:vo dqaq010 12 teppei 03.ogg Teppei: Unless... we have a traitor in our midst.
Media:vo dqaq010 12 teppei 04.ogg Teppei: They must have an informant feeding them intelligence and helping them to approach unseen. That's the only possible explanation.
Media:vo dqaq010 12 teppei 05.ogg Teppei: Our priority is finding the agent and protecting the camp. This is my chance to show what I'm made of!
Media:vo dqaq010 12 teppei 06.ogg Teppei: In that case... Understood, leave the repairs to us. We can make use of the wood and rope nearby to patch up the defenses.
Media:vo dqaq010 12 teppei 07.ogg Teppei: Why don't we make this more interesting, recruit! A contest between the two of us. Just don't underestimate me, haha! If there's anything I know, it's logistics, you'll see!
Media:vo dqaq010 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Why are you so insistent about being on the front line?
Media:vo dqaq010 13 teppei 01.ogg Teppei: Alright, that should do it. The Shogun's Army will have a hard time getting past this, no matter how determined they are!
Media:vo dqaq010 13 teppei 02.ogg Teppei: It seems I've made another valuable contribution to the resistance... But why does it always have to be logistics work!
Media:vo dqaq010 13 teppei 03.ogg Teppei: I thought getting transferred to the front line would be a chance to showcase my abilities and square off with the enemy. Instead, here I am doing what I've always done before.
Media:vo dqaq010 13 teppei 04.ogg Teppei: It's just like General Gorou said, we joined the resistance because of our warrior's will.
Media:vo dqaq010 13 teppei 05.ogg Teppei: There are a multitude of ways to contribute to the resistance, but who wouldn't want to take out a few Shogunate Samurai, given the chance?
Media:vo dqaq010 13 teppei 06.ogg Teppei: Anyway, we got more than we bargained for inspecting the camp! Let's report back to General Gorou.
Media:vo dqaq010 13 teppei 07.ogg Teppei: If all goes well, we might just be assigned a few missions closer to the action!
Media:vo dqaq010 14 kaidaryouma 01.ogg Kaida Ryouma: We've had a change of plans. The general has been dispatched to the front line to lead our forces into battle.
Media:vo dqaq010 14 kaidaryouma 02.ogg Kaida Ryouma: The Shogun's Army is attempting an advance on the main front. Reports have it that Kujou Sara is now personally leading the enemy forces.
Media:vo dqaq010 14 kaidaryouma 03.ogg Kaida Ryouma: As for us... It's been days since Her Excellency last made an appearance here. We've executed almost all the directives she gave us, but have received no further instruction.
Media:vo dqaq010 14 kaidaryouma 04.ogg Kaida Ryouma: The situation is becoming grim... If we retreat any further, I fear morale may falter.
Media:vo dqaq010 14 kaidaryouma 05.ogg Kaida Ryouma: For now, we can only pray that General Gorou will be able to turn the tide... however difficult that may seem.
Media:vo dqaq010 14 teppei 01.ogg Teppei: Strange, I don't see General Gorou anywhere.
Media:vo dqaq010 14 teppei 02.ogg Teppei: We should go to the front line.
Media:vo dqaq010 14 teppei 03.ogg Teppei: Our forces need all the help they can get — we're no use to them here.
Media:vo dqaq010 14 teppei 04.ogg Teppei: We mustn't let Tatarasuna fall to the enemy!
Media:vo dqaq010 15 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: I have faith in Her Excellency, and in the soldiers of the resistance.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: The Vision Hunt Decree is a brutal injustice. Our resistance has only just begun!
Media:vo dqaq010 15 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: So that's why you brought reinforcements, just to get—
Media:vo dqaq010 15 gorou 04a.ogg Media:vo dqaq010 15 gorou 04b.ogg Gorou: That's where you're wrong — (he/she) means just as much to us. As a member of the resistance, (he/she)'s a comrade. I'll never surrender (him/her) to you.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: "The resistance never betrays its own." Her Excellency made that clear to everyone from the very beginning.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: Teppei... and the Traveler? What are you doing here?
Media:vo dqaq010 15 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: *chuckle* It would appear our time to fight side-by-side has finally come...
Media:vo dqaq010 15 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: Before the battle begins, each side chooses their finest warrior for a match of single combat.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: To the superior force, there is little significance in such a duel. But for the weaker force, victory could constitute an important boost to their morale.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: Her motives are clear. She wants to use the match as an opportunity to capture you. Do not feel compelled to participate — we can take the fight to them without such a ceremony.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Be wary, you're up against a powerful opponent.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 gorou 12.ogg Resistance Soldier: Look! That's two rounds in a row!
Media:vo dqaq010 15 gorou 13.ogg Resistance Soldier: The Shogun's Army is not invincible! We can win!
Media:vo dqaq010 15 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: The soldiers are rallying... Your warrior's will is bringing them hope, Traveler...
Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 01.ogg Kujou Sara: So you are the only one here? Hm... I thought I might get to meet your grand strategist.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 02.ogg Kujou Sara: She is the one that's been causing our forces so much trouble. The fact the resistance has even held out for this long is thanks to her.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 03.ogg Kujou Sara: But soon, the resistance will fall. They are no match for the might of the Shogun's Army... Her schemes mean nothing now.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 04.ogg Kujou Sara: We have already rooted out those behind the resistance. All who have dishonored the Almighty Shogun will be punished.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 05.ogg Kujou Sara: ...It is futile. There is one other thing. I'm sure you've seen the recent arrest warrants. I trust that the blond traveler is somewhere among your forces now.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 06a.ogg Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 06b.ogg Kujou Sara: I will make you a deal. Hand (him/her) over to us, and you'll buy yourself some time. A respite from the bloodshed would be advantageous to both sides, would it not?
Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 07a.ogg Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 07b.ogg Kujou Sara: (He/She) is of great importance to the almighty Shogun.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 08a.ogg Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 08b.ogg Kujou Sara: But the way I see it, (he/she) is expendable to the resistance.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 09.ogg Kujou Sara: Well, well... we meet again. This time, I won't let you get away.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 10.ogg Kujou Sara: I thought that you would seek refuge with the resistance in the hope of receiving asylum.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 11.ogg Kujou Sara: That you choose to show up here proves that you have more bravery in you than I had originally thought. And now that you are here, I have a proposal...
Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 12.ogg Kujou Sara: Why not represent the resistance in a fight of honor?
Media:vo dqaq010 15 kujousara 13.ogg Kujou Sara: Remove all threats to eternity — by order of the almighty Shogun.
Media:vo dqaq010 15 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: A "fight of honor"...? What's that?
Media:vo dqaq010 15 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Well, what do you think? Will you fight?
Media:vo dqaq010 15 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: There's more than one round! Keep it up!
Media:vo dqaq010 15 teppei 01.ogg Teppei: General Gorou!
Media:vo dqaq010 15 teppei 02.ogg Teppei: You can take 'em!
Media:vo dqaq010 16 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Prepare to engage!
Media:vo dqaq010 16 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: All of you, with me!
Media:vo dqaq010 16 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: Well received, Your Excellency!
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kokomi 01.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Greetings, (Traveler). This is the first time we've met, please allow me to introduce myself.
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kokomi 02.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I am Sangonomiya Kokomi, organizer of the resistance, and also the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island.
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kokomi 03.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Perhaps it's the first time you're hearing that title... To put it simply, I'm the person currently in charge on Watatsumi Island, which is also the home front of the resistance.
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kokomi 04.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I've actually heard all about you from Beidou and Kazuha. I hadn't expected to find you'd joined the resistance, though.
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kokomi 05.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Do you have a plan beyond this point?
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kokomi 06.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... in that case, shall we continue our conversation at the shrine of Sangonomiya?
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kokomi 07.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Although the Shogun's Army has retreated for now, the war is far from over.
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kokomi 08.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: The Vision Hunt Decree has not been repealed, and neither the Tenryou Commission nor the Raiden Shogun show any sign of stopping... In short, our problems have yet to be resolved.
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kokomi 09.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I suggest we move to the shrine to discuss our counter-plan. What say you?
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kokomi 10.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Gorou, thank you for all you have done.
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kokomi 11.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Our forces are weaker than the Shogun's Army, and my absence can only have made the recent days all the more trying for you.
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kokomi 12.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'm afraid I must still ask you to stay a while longer, to keep eyes on the Shogun's Army and also to see to the wounded. Mm... But I will ask the mercenaries to remain stationed here, and Kazuha is here too. Hopefully, this will serve to reduce the pressure you are under.
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kokomi 13.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...I must return to Sangonomiya now, I have a few things to attend to... Once you're ready, (Traveler), please rendezvous with Teppei. He will escort you there.
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kokomi 14.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Thank you for all your efforts so far. From this day on, I fight alongside you.
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kokomi 15.ogg Sangonomiya Kokomi: Fight... for the future of Inazuma.
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kujousara 01.ogg Kujou Sara: Stronger than I anticipated... This contest has served its purpose.
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kujousara 02.ogg Kujou Sara: Soldiers, attack!
Media:vo dqaq010 16 kujousara 03.ogg Kujou Sara: Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!
Media:vo dqaq010 16 teppei 01.ogg Teppei: Um... Can I come, too?
Media:vo dqaq010 16 teppei 02.ogg Teppei: I know Watatsumi Island very well. I can carry on being your guide, if you'd like.
Media:vo dqaq010 2 ishihara 01.ogg Ishihara: But most of our forces are out on the front line. How are we supposed to effectively prioritize them? We'll just have to make sure we keep our eyes peeled when we're out on patrol.
Media:vo dqaq010 2 ishihara 02.ogg Ishihara: I doubt it. Their rearguard isn't far from there. We're gaining ground at the moment, but I don't think we've pushed them back that far.
Media:vo dqaq010 2 ishihara 03.ogg Ishihara: Anyway, we should focus on patrol. Come on, we're up.
Media:vo dqaq010 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: The northwest of Musoujin Gorge... So that's where the resistance forces are based. We should keep asking around though, just to be safe.
Media:vo dqaq010 2 takayama 01.ogg Takayama: *yawn* ...I heard they added a couple more people to the wanted list. They're high-priority targets, apparently.
Media:vo dqaq010 2 takayama 02.ogg Takayama: *sigh* I wonder how they're faring on the front line.
Media:vo dqaq010 2 takayama 03.ogg Takayama: The last thing I heard was that we'd pushed the resistance back to just northwest of Musoujin Gorge. I don't know if that's true.
Media:vo dqaq010 2 takayama 04.ogg Takayama: Eh, fair point... *sigh* Time to go to work.
Media:vo dqaq010 3 haruichirou 01.ogg Jiichirou: Yeah. Where are you headed?
Media:vo dqaq010 3 haruichirou 02.ogg Jiichirou: Ugh, don't get me started. I was recuperating on Nazuchi Beach — it's complete chaos over there.
Media:vo dqaq010 3 haruichirou 03.ogg Jiichirou: The resistance aren't having an easy time of it. They don't have the manpower for an all-out confrontation, so they can't contend with the Shogun's Army.
Media:vo dqaq010 3 haruichirou 04.ogg Jiichirou: The front line used to be further forward, but they had to retreat a couple of times. Now they're back to Nazuchi Beach.
Media:vo dqaq010 3 haruichirou 05.ogg Jiichirou: That's where I've just come from — I was lucky to get out. It's much too dangerous... their forces are so scattered that no one knows who's who, and anyone you run into pulls their weapon... I just dropped my luggage and ran here.
Media:vo dqaq010 3 haruichirou 06.ogg Jiichirou: I think we need to keep moving — things are changing so fast. The further away we can get, the better.
Media:vo dqaq010 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Nazuchi Beach... Sounds like that's where the resistance and the Shogun's Army are battling it out right now. Let's head over and take a look.
Media:vo dqaq010 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hey, look! D'you think that's a resistance fighter?
Media:vo dqaq010 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Looks like he's in a tight spot... Let's go help him out!
Media:vo dqaq010 3 sakamoto 01.ogg Sakamoto: Oh, hey. You managed to escape too?
Media:vo dqaq010 3 sakamoto 02.ogg Sakamoto: Higi Village. I've heard the rumors, but it's still gotta be a safer place than a warzone.
Media:vo dqaq010 3 sakamoto 03.ogg Sakamoto: What about you?
Media:vo dqaq010 3 sakamoto 04.ogg Sakamoto: Agreed... Why don't we stick together? Can't hurt to team up with someone.
Media:vo dqaq010 4 paimon 01a.ogg Media:vo dqaq010 4 paimon 01b.ogg Paimon: (He/She)'s a special case! (He/She) doesn't have a Vision, but (he/she) can control the elements anyway.
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 01.ogg Teppei: Phew... You saved me. I thought I was about to die.
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 02.ogg Teppei: Thank you so much for your help. I'm Teppei of the Gobious Platoon. I'm with the resistance.
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 03.ogg Teppei: I was sent to the front line just recently — I was looking forward to doing my part... Instead, it seems I fell at the first hurdle.
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 04.ogg Teppei: So, uh... You aren't dressed like resistance fighters — have you come here looking to sign up?
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 05.ogg Teppei: Great! Just the other day I heard General Gorou complaining about how desperate we are for more people. Your support will make a big difference.
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 06.ogg Teppei: I'll escort you back to our camp... But first, let me bring you up to speed on our current situation.
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 07.ogg Teppei: As you can see, the resistance are at a constant disadvantage when it comes to open confrontation.
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 08.ogg Teppei: The goal of the Shogun's Army is to uphold "eternity." To this end, they have the support of the Tenryou Commission's general, Kujou Sara, who commands an exceptionally strong force.
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 09.ogg Teppei: As for us... Vision bearers are few and far between as it is, and because of the Vision Hunt Decree, they're rarer than ever.
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 10.ogg Teppei: The fact we're even able to hold out is thanks to the brilliant strategic mind of Her Excellency, Sangonomiya. We're also indebted to the great courage shown by General Gorou and the resistance troops.
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 11.ogg Teppei: *sigh* If only I had a Vision myself... Not only would I be better placed to share Her Excellency and General Gorou's burden, but I'd be able to hold my own on the battlefield, too...
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 12.ogg Teppei: I couldn't help but notice that you used elemental energy when saving me just now. You must have a Vision yourself?
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 13.ogg Teppei: Are you serious!? That's... incredible. And I guess that means you're immune to the Vision Hunt Decree?
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 14.ogg Teppei: You have to let me introduce you to General Gorou! He'll welcome you with open arms!
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 15.ogg Teppei: Perhaps I can also make a worthy contribution, this way... Of course, I'd much rather prove my worth by the sword. If only taking down Shogunate Samurai was as easy as you make it look.
Media:vo dqaq010 4 teppei 16.ogg Teppei: Anyway, we shouldn't delay. Let's head off!
Media:vo dqaq010 5 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Hmm... *clears throat*
Media:vo dqaq010 5 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: I presume you've heard that the goal of the resistance is to defeat the Shogun's Army and repeal the Vision Hunt Decree.
Media:vo dqaq010 5 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: This is no easy task. Each who sets foot on the battlefield must be ready to sacrifice their life.
Media:vo dqaq010 5 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Tell me, why do you wish to join us? The resistance cannot accept any who don't possess a warrior's will — you and I must be certain of your decision.
Media:vo dqaq010 5 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: You're referring to the ceremony to mark the 100th Vision seized under the decree, right? Yes, we received some new of it here, despite it taking place over in Inazuma City.
Media:vo dqaq010 5 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: There was a disturbance, allegedly... Highly unusual, considering that the Raiden Shogun appeared in person...
Media:vo dqaq010 5 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: But why do you wish to discuss this all of a sudden? Unless you have some information to share?
Media:vo dqaq010 5 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: ...What?
Media:vo dqaq010 5 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: Now that you mention it, we did just recover a bounty notice from a Shogunate Samurai defeated in battle.
Media:vo dqaq010 5 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: It read "Reward for the capture of a blond-haired traveler and their mysterious flying pet." Hmm... So, this refers to you two?
Media:vo dqaq010 5 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: My apologies, I understand your situation well enough for now. On behalf of the resistance, welcome to our ranks.
Media:vo dqaq010 5 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: Her Excellency is currently away from the camp. We don't know where she went, but she instructed us to take care of everything in her absence.
Media:vo dqaq010 5 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: I will ask Teppei here to should you around the camp first, and then dispatch you straight to the front line. If you are ready, of course.
Media:vo dqaq010 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yup, we had a fight with the Raiden Shogun and everything. The, we grabbed the Vision bearer and whisked him off to safety.
Media:vo dqaq010 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: After that, they added us to the army's wanted list... That's why we came here.
Media:vo dqaq010 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What! Who are they calling a "mysterious flying pet"!?
Media:vo dqaq010 5 teppei 01.ogg Teppei: This is what happened, General Gorou.
Media:vo dqaq010 5 teppei 02.ogg Teppei: I was surrounded by Shogunate Samurai, and they came to my rescue.
Media:vo dqaq010 5 teppei 03.ogg Teppei: They can use the elements without a Vision! The resistance could really use people with that kind of skill. We should bring them in!
Media:vo dqaq010 5 teppei 04.ogg Teppei: Yes sir.
Media:vo dqaq010 5 teppei 05.ogg Teppei: I used to be in the Logistics Division, so I'm the right person to show you around — I know the setup like the back of my hand.
Media:vo dqaq010 5 teppei 06.ogg Teppei: I'll make sure you get a warm resistance welcome!
Media:vo dqaq010 5 teppei 07.ogg Teppei: Let's start with the field hospital. Some of my friends are recovering there.
Media:vo dqaq010 5 teppei 08.ogg Teppei: Last time I saw them, I promised that I'd introduce any new recruits. When they're finally back on the battlefield alongside us, we'll all be brothers in arms!
Media:vo dqaq010 6 masashi 01.ogg Masashi: Looks like a strong addition to the troop... Hopefully someone I can spar with after I've recovered.
Media:vo dqaq010 6 masashi 02.ogg Masashi: Look at you! When did you grow nerves of steel?
Media:vo dqaq010 6 masashi 03.ogg Masashi: Huh, that's a lukewarm epiphany if you ask me. While you're lying there itching to get better, I'm still out there training hard despite my injury... even though it burst open again yesterday...
Media:vo dqaq010 6 masashi 04.ogg Masashi: Sure, I'll take one! Thanks!
Media:vo dqaq010 6 teppei 01.ogg Teppei: Aha, well... the enemy are much stronger than we could've imagined, but we're holding our own... I've been right in the thick of it.
Media:vo dqaq010 6 teppei 02.ogg Teppei: At one point, there were a horde of enemy troops surging towards us like the tide... but I didn't flinch. I drew my blade and charged straight into the fray! Four Shogunate Samurai, and only one of me — but I still managed to fend them off.
Media:vo dqaq010 6 teppei 03a.ogg Media:vo dqaq010 6 teppei 03b.ogg Teppei: This (guy/lady) stole the show, though. When (he/she) saw me tiring and falling back, (he/she) burst onto the scene and took down a whole group of them in one fell swoop! They were no match for (him/her) at all.
Media:vo dqaq010 6 teppei 04a.ogg Media:vo dqaq010 6 teppei 04b.ogg Teppei: I heard (he/she) even stormed the Vision Hunt Ceremony... and that the Raiden Shogun herself failed to take (him/her) down!
Media:vo dqaq010 6 teppei 05.ogg Teppei: It did? Well, do you need me to get you something to dress it with?
Media:vo dqaq010 6 teppei 06.ogg Teppei: I heard about a remedy recently that uses wild bugs. All you need to do is grind Onikabuto into powder, and it makes a very effective dressing.
Media:vo dqaq010 6 teppei 07.ogg Teppei: They say it feels cool on the skin and acts fast to completely cure flesh wounds.
Media:vo dqaq010 6 teppei 08.ogg Teppei: Well, how about we let our new recruit decide? I'll stay here and make some preparations...
Media:vo dqaq010 6 teppei 09.ogg Teppei: If you're a fan of weird and wonderful remedies, please gather some Onikabuto for me. I'll take it from there.
Media:vo dqaq010 6 teppei 10.ogg Teppei: But if you're more of a Wolfhook advocate, bring some of those instead. Personally, I recommend we try the new remedy — it sounds promising!
Media:vo dqaq010 6 tokuda 01.ogg Tokuda: *coughing* ...Is this a new recruit?
Media:vo dqaq010 6 tokuda 02.ogg Tokuda: Whoa, whoa, brand new recruit and your first thought is to start sparring with them? You're getting ahead of yourself. That wound of yours isn't something that's gonna clear up in a few days.
Media:vo dqaq010 6 tokuda 03.ogg Tokuda: Teppei, did you bring this one in? How are things on the front line?
Media:vo dqaq010 6 tokuda 04.ogg Tokuda: Amazing work, both of you.
Media:vo dqaq010 6 tokuda 05a.ogg Media:vo dqaq010 6 tokuda 05b.ogg Tokuda: Still, uh... I can believe most of that, but (him/her) facing off against the Raiden Shogun? I think you might be embellishing the story a little there, Teppei... I mean, we've all heard of the Musou no Hitotachi, right? Haha.
Media:vo dqaq010 6 tokuda 06.ogg Tokuda: *sigh* Either way, to tell the truth, with all the losses we've sustained recently, I was starting to lose hope in our ability to hold out much longer.
Media:vo dqaq010 6 tokuda 07.ogg Tokuda: But seeing fresh recruits join our ranks and hearing Teppei's exploits... I'm itching to get myself better as soon as possible, so I can get back out on the front line.
Media:vo dqaq010 6 tokuda 08.ogg Tokuda: Hmm, sounds a little strange to me... I would've thought Wolfhooks would do the trick, but it's your decision.
Media:vo dqaq010 7 teppei 01.ogg Teppei: Thanks for your help! Have you decided which dressing to use yet?
(Opens item submission menu)
Media:vo dqaq010 8 masashi 01.ogg Masahi: Looks like this might actually work. Not bad, Teppei! As soon as I'm better, we'll have to do some serious sparring together to make up for lost time.
Media:vo dqaq010 8 masashi 02.ogg Masahi: Don't forget to visit the training grounds! Get some practice in before you hit the front line!
Media:vo dqaq010 8 teppei 01.ogg Teppei: Alright! I knew you'd back me on this!
Media:vo dqaq010 8 teppei 02.ogg Teppei: I can't guarantee it'll work, but if it does, everyone will be fighting fit again in no time.
Media:vo dqaq010 8 teppei 03.ogg Teppei: Why don't you hand me the ingredients — it's a bit of a chore to prepare, so I'll take it from here.
Media:vo dqaq010 8 teppei 04.ogg Teppei: Hehe, just glad we were able to help. Alright, I'm gonna continue giving our new recruit the grand tour. Rest up, you guys.
Media:vo dqaq010 8 teppei 05.ogg Teppei: The training grounds... That reminds me, they should be doing archery training over there right now. Let's head over.
Media:vo dqaq010 8 tokuda 01.ogg Tokuda: *grimace* Ow, ow, ow...
Media:vo dqaq010 8 tokuda 02.ogg Tokuda: ...Huh? Just like that, the pain's stopped. Now it just feels numb...
Media:vo dqaq010 8 tokuda 03.ogg Tokuda: Sparring? You have a one track mind, seriously... But good going, Teppei.
Media:vo dqaq010 8 tokuda 04.ogg Tokuda: When you first applied it, it felt like you were rubbing salt into the wound. But then the pain disappeared and there was just a cool sensation. I swear I can feel my body repairing itself already... Still... I better not start overdoing it quite yet.
Media:vo dqaq010 8 tokuda 05.ogg Tokuda: Thanks to both of you for looking after us so well. The day I'm discharged, drinks are on me.
Media:vo dqaq010 8 tokuda 06.ogg Tokuda: *sigh* Calm down and get some rest...
Media:vo dqaq010 9 masashi 01.ogg Masashi: Hmm... You may have skimped a little here though. I feel like I could use some more!
Media:vo dqaq010 9 masashi 02.ogg Masashi: I'm dying to get out of this place! I just want to be back on the battlefield, with you!
Media:vo dqaq010 9 teppei 01.ogg Teppei: Oh...
Media:vo dqaq010 9 teppei 02.ogg Teppei: Never mind, I guess this was probably the safer option.
Media:vo dqaq010 9 teppei 03.ogg Teppei: I may need your help in a moment to change their dressings. Here's hoping this'll speed up their recovery.
Media:vo dqaq010 9 teppei 04.ogg Teppei: And, uh, thanks for your help gathering the ingredients.
Media:vo dqaq010 9 teppei 05.ogg Teppei: You got it! Alright, let's move out.
Media:vo dqaq010 9 tokuda 01.ogg Tokuda: *grimace* ...This really hurts when you first put it on.
Media:vo dqaq010 9 tokuda 02.ogg Tokuda: It's a standard remedy, but a dependable one. More importantly, thanks for the fresh dressing — much appreciated.
Media:vo dqaq010 9 tokuda 03.ogg Tokuda: I don't think it works like that... Piling on extra dressing isn't going to make you heal faster. Especially not when you're sneaking off to go train in the middle of night! You have to cut that out, you know...
Media:vo dqaq010 9 tokuda 04.ogg Tokuda: Thanks again, Teppei... and thanks to our new recruit here.
Media:vo dqaq010 9 tokuda 05.ogg Tokuda: Speaking of training, that reminds me — they should be doing some archery practice down at the training grounds right now. Why don't you take our new recruit to go check it out?
Media:vo dqaq010 9 tokuda 06.ogg Tokuda: It'll be a good chance for them to meet a few more of our platoon and settle in.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Now is our moment!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The wait is over my comrades
Tenryou Soldiers: Chaaaarge!!!
