 I did gather some.
 I understand.
 Quest DescriptionAfter some searching, you have found some components. Time to discuss your findings with Hosseini
 Very conscientious of you.
Hosseini: Well, this is my first time working with Pursina's Spikes, so it's best to err on the side of caution.
Hosseini: As long as we can secure the components we need, they can be repaired in no time at all.
Hosseini: Even a small adjustment can greatly affect the function of the entire machine. So I was worried if our calibrations would achieve their intended effect.
Hosseini: For Safety reasons, I hope to ask you to give it a few trial runs. I will then make further calibrations based off the data you collect in these trials.
Hosseini: Now that we have these, this won't take long.
Hosseini: Thank you, that's a big help.
Hosseini: There is still one small matter that I thought it best to discuss with you.
Hosseini: They are very intricate tools, as I supposed I should have expected from one so skilled as Pursina.
Hosseini: This way, we can ensure that our spikes are functioning at peak efficiency. Otherwise things might get dicey if they malfunction when you engage that anomalous model.
Hosseini: Well, I leave the tests in your capable hands, Traveler.
Hosseini: Well, this is my first time working with Pursina's Spikes, so it's best to err on the side of caution.
Hosseini: When you were collecting components these past few days, I scrutinized the inner workings of the Pursina's Spikes we have on hand.
Hosseini: You're just in time. The calibration work on Pursina's spike is going quite smooth indeed.
