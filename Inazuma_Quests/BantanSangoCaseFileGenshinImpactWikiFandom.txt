 (He seems to have forgotten what he was saying...)
 (Why is he suddenly at a loss for words?)
 Aren't you worried about your assistant?
Sango: He's very skilled and tough. No need to worry about him.
Sango: After all, he used to be a Doushin.
 Can I be a detective?
Sango: You want to be a detective? It's a tough job. Don't let fiction fool you.
Sango: There are no thrilling chases or life and death decisions during cases.
Sango: Real detective work is more along the lines of files that fill an entire room, muddy mountain roads, and suspects who leave nary a trace...
Sango: Maybe it's hard to understand from me just describing it... I happen to have a small case open. Why don't you get some personal experience in?
 He isn't in any danger, is he?
Sango: I went over everything with him. Even if something unexpected happens, he should be able to handle it.
 I didn't meet a single detective in all of Mondstadt.
Sango: Mondstadt... Oh, you mean Mondstadt City. I've heard of it.
Sango: The two most famous things about Mondstadt are its wine and its freedom.
Sango: Haha, those two things really compliment each other... I suspect that if there were detectives in Mondstadt, their business would be booming every day.
 I'm Sango's assistant.
Andou: Sango's assistant? Now that sounds even more suspicious...
 I'm not sure I've done anything to help...
 I've never seen a detective in Liyue.
Sango: Liyue doesn't really need detectives. I've heard of how much they value contracts there.
Sango: Besides, they have the Millelith, who quickly solve problems large and small...
Sango: Even if there were a detective agency, I suspect it would have to close down due of lack of business.
 I've only met one legal adviser... (Unlocked if the player met Yanfei during A Teapot to Call Home: Part I)
Sango: Legal advisers? Ah... I've heard that... they're pretty difficult to deal with.
Sango: I suspect that what these people do is complicate simple problems. They take something simple and make it complex and then turn it into confusing contracts.
Sango: I hope I never meet one.
 It sounds like quite a hassle...
Sango: That's right. Detectives are professional problem solvers.
Sango: Thrilling chases and life and death decisions are just for the novels.
Sango: Real detective work is more along the lines of files that fill an entire room, muddy mountain roads, and suspects who leave nary a trace...
Sango: But the novels do get one thing right: detectives always have a variety of assistants.
 So you also have assistants, then?
Sango: Of course. Mine is busy outside, as a matter of fact. So now... I'm in need of another one.
Sango: Would you be willing to help me?
 Might I ask your name?
Sango: My name is Sango, and I'm the president of this detective agency.
Sango: Well, I call myself the president, but this detective agency only has two employees.
 Quest DescriptionYou hear of a mysterious store called the Bantan Sango Detective Agency in Inazuma...
 Ready?
Sango: Yes. The two Doushin from the police station are important "assistants" in closing this case.
 So you also have assistants, then?
 So, you also followed a suspicious person here?
Amano: You can say that. Albeit the suspicious person we were pursuing was actually you. Ahem.
 The things that you just said...
 There couldn't have been an accident, right?...
Sango: Not likely. I covered everything with him.
Sango: Even if something unexpected happens...
Sango: With his skills, he should be able to take care of himself.
 What are you planning?
Sango: I am a detective, so I plan on solving the case, of course.
Sango: The two Doushin from the police station are important "assistants" in closing that case.
 What are you two doing here?
Amano: Andou said that there was a suspicious blonde outlander wandering around town, so we came to have a look.
 What do you do as a detective?
Sango: Huh, that's a good question. From the perspective of the general public, detective work might seem rather special and mysterious.
Sango: But as far as I'm concerned, it's like any other work. It pays the bills.
Sango: That said, the work is a little unusual sometimes and the clients are occasionally noteworthy individuals...
Sango: But otherwise, it's a way to make a living just like any other.
 Why didn't you go with your assistant?
Sango: Well, how should I put it... we both have our roles to play.
Sango: He is responsible for gathering evidence and clues and I'm responsible for analyzing them to uncover the truth.
Sango: A reasonable division of labor is the basis for an agency to function well.
 You talking to me?
Andou: Yeah, I mean, you're the only outlander here.
Andou: Sango's assistant? Now that sounds even more suspicious...
 You were expecting me?
Amano: Ah... Ryuuji, you said that you found the suspicious person in the city, right?
Amano: Alright, let's not be overly sensitive. Ryuuji, what brings you here?
Amano: Andou said that there was a suspicious blonde outlander wandering around town, so we came to have a look.
Amano: Are those Treasure Hoarders? Why are they so close to the city...
Amano: I see... But why would there be Treasure Hoarders nearby?
Amano: Miss Sango, is this true?
Amano: Miss Sango, may we borrow the evidence? We need it to convince the higher-ups to take action.
Amano: That's why we followed you. I didn't know that you were Sango's assistant. Sorry for the misunderstanding.
Amano: Working with Sango makes you a good speaker, I see, eh?
Amano: Yes... yes, that's right! Let's go find Sango. Ryuuji, you should head back soon too.
Amano: You can say that. Albeit the suspicious person we were pursuing was actually you. Ahem.
Andou: Amano! Let's go back and report this.
Andou: Are the serial burglaries in the city really the work of Treasure Hoarders?
Andou: Hey, what are you guys doing?
Andou: Hmm... Amano, let's go look for Sango. If there really are Treasure Hoarders in town, we should do something.
Andou: Hmm... Ryuuji, how are you suddenly so good at talking? You weren't much of a talker before.
Andou: How dare they try to sink their paws into our city...
Andou: Please rest assured! We shan't let any of the Treasure Hoarders off!
Andou: Ryuuji, why are you here? And this suspicious outsider...
Andou: Ryuuji, you just mentioned you were following some suspicious people... Hey! Did you follow the Treasure Hoarders from inside the city?
Andou: Sango's assistant? Now that sounds even more suspicious...
Andou: The Treasure Hoarders... how dare they! They have no regard for us at all, do they?
Andou: We must step up our patrols. We can't give these jerks a single opening.
Andou: Yeah, I mean, you're the only outlander here.
Ryuuji: ...Phew.
Ryuuji: Ah. You're the assistant Sango was talking about?
Ryuuji: Hmm... Still, we can only drive off one or two Treasure Hoarders by ourselves. To get rid of them completely, we have to rely on you guys.
Ryuuji: I followed him out of town, and you all know what happened after that.
Ryuuji: I think so. Sango's been dealing with a serial theft case. I've been searching the city based on her hunch.
Ryuuji: I was following a suspicious person here according to Sango's instructions, but then I bumped into some Treasure Hoarders.
Ryuuji: If you want to see the evidence, you can go to the city and look for Sango. She will explain everything to you in detail.
Ryuuji: Let's head back.
Ryuuji: Sango asked me to say them.
Ryuuji: Shortly after, I spotted a suspicious man near Hanamizaka. He left in a panic after I just asked a couple of questions.
Ryuuji: That's correct.
Ryuuji: The Traveler is an assistant invited by Sango. We just drove the Treasure Hoarders off together.
Ryuuji: We've done our part, so let's go back.
Ryuuji: Well... not really. It's just Sango said that someone was coming to help out.
Ryuuji: Yeah. But when it's only... us...
Ryuuji: Yes. Traveler and I fought them off.
Sango: A reasonable division of labor is the basis for an agency to function well.
Sango: After all, he used to be a Doushin.
Sango: After all, it was more effective to let the Doushin witness the Treasure Hoarders themselves than for me to just tell them.
Sango: After the two Doushin step up their patrols, the Treasure Hoarders in town will be on high alert.
Sango: All we have to do now is wait for an opportunity.
Sango: Anyway, take these. Who knows? Maybe I'll need your help again some time.
Sango: Besides, they have the Millelith, who quickly solve problems large and small...
Sango: But as far as I'm concerned, it's like any other work. It pays the bills.
Sango: But otherwise, it's a way to make a living just like any other.
Sango: But the novels do get one thing right: detectives always have a variety of assistants.
Sango: Could you go get Ryuuji for me?
Sango: Don't say that. You attracted Andou's attention by being an outlander, and got him and Amano to chase you and rendezvous with Ryuuji...
Sango: Even if something unexpected happens...
Sango: Even if there were a detective agency, I suspect it would have to close down due of lack of business.
Sango: Haha, those two things really compliment each other... I suspect that if there were detectives in Mondstadt, their business would be booming every day.
Sango: He is responsible for gathering evidence and clues and I'm responsible for analyzing them to uncover the truth.
Sango: He should have collected enough clues by now, though.
Sango: He's very skilled and tough. No need to worry about him.
Sango: Hm, I see. You don't have any problems... you just want to wander around...
Sango: Hmm... that's good. You've probably made quite a splash.
Sango: Huh, that's a good question. From the perspective of the general public, detective work might seem rather special and mysterious.
Sango: I am a detective, so I plan on solving the case, of course.
Sango: I hope I never meet one.
Sango: I suspect that what these people do is complicate simple problems. They take something simple and make it complex and then turn it into confusing contracts.
Sango: I went over everything with him. Even if something unexpected happens, he should be able to handle it.
Sango: It's about time...
Sango: Legal advisers? Ah... I've heard that... they're pretty difficult to deal with.
Sango: Liyue doesn't really need detectives. I've heard of how much they value contracts there.
Sango: Maybe it's hard to understand from me just describing it... I happen to have a small case open. Why don't you get some personal experience in?
Sango: Mondstadt... Oh, you mean Mondstadt City. I've heard of it.
Sango: My assistant, Ryuuji, went out to collect clues a little while ago and still hasn't returned.
Sango: My name is Sango, and I'm the president of this detective agency.
Sango: No problem, go ahead. It's not within our agency's ability to handle the Treasure Hoarders. We'll have to rely on the police for that.
Sango: Not likely. I covered everything with him.
Sango: Now they've seen the threat of the Treasure Hoarders with their own eyes, which will cause them to step up patrols in the city...
Sango: Now, you look kinda interested in the detective agency.
Sango: Of course. Mine is busy outside, as a matter of fact. So now... I'm in need of another one.
Sango: Oh-ho, welcome. Are you having a problem?
Sango: Real detective work is more along the lines of files that fill an entire room, muddy mountain roads, and suspects who leave nary a trace...
Sango: Ryuuji, you fought with the Treasure Hoarders at the place I asked you to go to, right?
Sango: So I'll wait for your news and of course, you will get paid. Plus... it's a chance for you to experience the life of a detective.
Sango: So, is this the first time you've seen a detective agency?
Sango: Thank you for your help, Traveler. Here's your remuneration.
Sango: Thank you. Now... everything should be ready.
Sango: That said, the work is a little unusual sometimes and the clients are occasionally noteworthy individuals...
Sango: That was all something only you could have done.
Sango: That's for certain. I've just shown you the evidence, I'm sure that with your professional instincts, you should have already figured that out.
Sango: That's right. Detectives are professional problem solvers.
Sango: The two Doushin from the police station are important "assistants" in closing that case.
Sango: The two most famous things about Mondstadt are its wine and its freedom.
Sango: There are no thrilling chases or life and death decisions during cases.
Sango: Thrilling chases and life and death decisions are just for the novels.
Sango: Well, I call myself the president, but this detective agency only has two employees.
Sango: Well, how should I put it... we both have our roles to play.
Sango: Well, this is the humble Bantan Sango Detective Agency. And I am a detective.
Sango: What I'm more concerned about is whether he has found what I'm looking for or not.
Sango: With his skills, he should be able to take care of himself.
Sango: Would you be willing to help me?
Sango: Yes. The two Doushin from the police station are important "assistants" in closing this case.
Sango: You want to be a detective? It's a tough job. Don't let fiction fool you.
Treasure Hoarder: Everyone, retreat!
Treasure Hoarder: This guy is a tough nut to crack...
Treasure Hoarder: What... a Doushin! Today is the worst!
