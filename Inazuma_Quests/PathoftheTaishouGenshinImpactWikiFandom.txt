Media:vo eqrg004 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's head over to the Mystic Onmyou Chamber and see!
Media:vo eqrg004 13 shikishogun 01.ogg Shiki Taishou: Those who seek ultimate attainment, can find it in the practices of this Mystic Onmyou Chamber.
Media:vo eqrg004 13 shikishogun 02.ogg Shiki Taishou: Of course, rushing straight for the strongest opponent may set you back. Know yourself, and proceed in accordance with your abilities.

Media:vo eqrg004 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yeah! Count Paimon in!

Media:vo eqrg004 2 shikishogun 01.ogg Shiki Taishou: Traveler, Paimon!
Media:vo eqrg004 2 shikishogun 02.ogg Shiki Taishou: I explained the situation to the Tenryou Commission and showed them the original documentation. In the end, they believed that the Mystic Onmyou Chamber and I were innocent.
Media:vo eqrg004 2 shikishogun 03.ogg Shiki Taishou: That's right. I've also restored the Mystic Onmyou Chamber to its original state â€” a domain dedicated to honing martial prowess.
Media:vo eqrg004 2 shikishogun 04.ogg Shiki Taishou: With time, this Domain may exhaust itself of charm magic. When that time comes, I will let it lie dormant so that power can gradually reaccumulate.
Media:vo eqrg004 2 shikishogun 05.ogg Shiki Taishou: Now might be a good time to give it a try. Are you up for the challenge?
