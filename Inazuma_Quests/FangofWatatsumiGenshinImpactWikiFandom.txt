 Quest DescriptionYou must first break the five seals on Watatsumi Island if you wish to enter Enkanomiya.
 Step DescriptionAn ancient stone tablet stands beside the shrine. Will there be anything of use written on it?
 Step DescriptionWith the help of the stone tablet's instructions, perhaps breaking the shrine seal will not be a problem... Right?
 Step DescriptionYou have finally broken the shrine's seal, and the Spirit Pearl is yours to claim. Go forth and take it!
Ancient Stone Tablet: "...To provoke battle, to defend, and end them quickly, and thus take unto oneself the spoils â€” 'tis the way of Watatsumi, marked in tooth and claw..."
Paimon: (Traveler), be careful!
Paimon: And that's a third! We're getting close!
Paimon: And this must be the "Fang"...
Paimon: Fourth Spirit Pearl obtained! Let's go find Tsuyuko!
Paimon: Look out! Those guys look pretty tough!
Paimon: Oh no, lots of hilichurls incoming!
Paimon: There's another Spirit Pearl!
Paimon: Ugh... There's barely anything legible here. Paimon guesses we'll need to fight and protect something... so we can get the Spirit Pearls... or something.
Paimon: Wait, why are these Treasure Hoarders and bandits also here?
Paimon: We found a pearl. Is this the Spirit Pearl Tsuyuko talked about?
