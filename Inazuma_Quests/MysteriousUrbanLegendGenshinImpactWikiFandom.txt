 "Made a wish"?
 ...
 A master of the sword...
 But doesn't like tofu.
 Define "serious"...?
 From "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits"?
 He looks very anxious.
 He looks very pitiful.
 I didn't think you guys would believe in this kind of thing.
 I have a rough idea.
 I'm completely bewildered as well.
 I'm more curious about Miko's reaction.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 14c.ogg Paimon: You're right. Big events in the light novel market should be at the center of her attention, surely? But she doesn't seem to care about this book at all.
 If Miko says it's fine, we probably don't need to worry.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 14b.ogg Paimon: Well, when you put it that way... She has been pretty trustworthy so far. She said from the beginning that it wasn't anything major, and so far, there hasn't been any big danger.
 Is it from a novel?
 Is it published by Yae Publishing House?
 It does worry me a bit.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 14a.ogg Paimon: Yeah... Youhei and Shingo may have been fine in the end, but things got pretty scary when Shingo was possessed.
 Lots of strength and passion...
 Paimon, calm down.
 Pretty sure there's more to an exorcism than "bravado"...
 Quest DescriptionYou planned to visit the Yae Publishing House, but after arriving in Hanamizaka, you find that it is more lively than usual here...
 Step DescriptionA mysterious samurai spirit has come out of Shingo's body. Fight first, parley later!
 Step DescriptionArriving at the Grand Narukami Shrine, you see Youhei, who is begging Yae Miko for help. A life is at stake here, so you decide to see Youhei's elder brother first.
 Step DescriptionThe nearby folk have mentioned a great deal about Shingo. Youhei also mentions that he saw his brother at the waterfall. It's time to meet this swordmaster.
 Step DescriptionThe spirit has dissipated. Time to find out the truth behind this incident.
 Step DescriptionYou learn from Shigeru and Junkichi that the source of the kaidan is a light novel named "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits." You decide to find out more about it from Yae Miko.
 Step DescriptionYouhei has run off to look for his brother. Perhaps you should take this opportunity to ask around a bit.
 The book, "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits"...
 The incantation they used...
 This does not sound credible...
 This is not a light novel though...
 We have no clue about this!
 We'd like your expert input on something.
 What does that mean?
 What's happened?
 What's up with him?
 Why did you wait till now to get him some help?
 Why didn't you seek help right away?
 Why the sudden urgency?
 Yeah, this is way beyond our level!
 You're so excited you can barely get the words out.
After a difficult battle, you defeat the spirit that was possessing Shingo...
As the salt is sprinkled, Katou Shingo collapses, and the thing that the two brothers "summoned" manifests...
Media:vo dialog ymlq001 junkichi 01.ogg Junkichi: Grasp the thought in mind, clear like the light of the moon... how does it go after that?
Media:vo dialog ymlq001 junkichi 02.ogg Junkichi: Mr. Shigeru, please! I'd appreciate it if you stopped trying to tear my dreams to smithereens. I am in great distress and desperately need to make a breakthrough!
Media:vo dialog ymlq001 kenji 01.ogg Kenji: Shingo's been pretty upbeat lately, but for some reason, Youhei's been in a really gloomy mood. I thought they were about to start taking on disciples and start their new chapter — what could be getting him down?
Media:vo dialog ymlq001 kenji 02.ogg Kenji: Maybe it's the weight of the responsibility dawning on him? If so, I guess Youhei's finally growing up.
Media:vo dialog ymlq001 kiyoto 01.ogg Kiyoto: I'm not as greedy as he is... I just wanna get through my exam...
Media:vo dialog ymlq001 nobuo 01.ogg Nobuo: I always used to tell Shingo to stop wasting his time, find something worthwhile to do, and stick to it.
Media:vo dialog ymlq001 nobuo 02.ogg Nobuo: Their parents passed away when they were young, and as the older of the two, he should be setting a good example rather than lazing around all the time... Of course, he wouldn't listen to me.
Media:vo dialog ymlq001 nobuo 03.ogg Nobuo: In my opinion, he hasn't had things bad enough yet to really feel the heat. He doesn't understand that you have to stay grounded and focused in life.
Media:vo dialog ymlq001 shigeru 01.ogg Shigeru: Junkichi, just give it up. Do you really think someone's going to just descend from the heavens and write your novel for you? I can't believe I'm saying this to a writer, but you need to learn to separate fact from fiction.
Media:vo dialog ymlq001 takatoshi 01.ogg Takatoshi: Come on, bring me Mora... Mora, Mora, and more Mora...
Media:vo ymlq001 1 kiyoto 01.ogg Kiyoto: But the exam's next week... If I fail again, I'm seriously done for. I'm better off wishing that my exam goes smoothly.
Media:vo ymlq001 1 kiyoto 02.ogg Kiyoto: Of course, I'm sure the part about waking up lying on a bed of Mora is a bit of an exaggeration.
Media:vo ymlq001 1 kiyoto 03.ogg Kiyoto: But whether you believe it or not, it's not exactly a difficult ritual. It can't hurt to give it a try, right?
Media:vo ymlq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We haven't been to the Yae Publishing House in a while. Paimon wonders if they have any new books in? The one we read with Ei that time was pretty cool...
Media:vo ymlq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What are they arguing about? It's quite a spirited debate.
Media:vo ymlq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: A wish ritual? ...That actually works?
Media:vo ymlq001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Right? Even Paimon knows that's just not how the world works.
Media:vo ymlq001 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: His whole bed was filled with M—M—M...!? Woooow!!!
Media:vo ymlq001 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Really? Well c'mon, (Traveler), let's go ask around right now, shall we?
Media:vo ymlq001 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Well, if it really is true, then just think of all the Mora Paimon could... Oh and you'd finally be reunited with your twin, too! Let's go, let's go!
Media:vo ymlq001 1 takatoshi 01.ogg Takatoshi: Come on, this is a no-brainer, man! There's only one thing worth wishing for — and that is a ton of Mora!
Media:vo ymlq001 1 takatoshi 02.ogg Takatoshi: Ahh, it's just an exam! Trust me, there's no problem you can't solve by throwing Mora at it. If it doesn't work, then just keep throwing till it does!
Media:vo ymlq001 1 takatoshi 03.ogg Takatoshi: Huh...? Really? You guys don't know?
Media:vo ymlq001 1 takatoshi 04.ogg Takatoshi: "You need but stand on this land at midnight, lower your head and recite a special incantation, then your wish will come true!"
Media:vo ymlq001 1 takatoshi 05.ogg Takatoshi: Looks like you guys really aren't in the loop. This, my friends, is the next big thing. A highly effective wish ritual, guaranteed to make your wishes come true!
Media:vo ymlq001 1 takatoshi 06.ogg Takatoshi: Heh, I didn't believe it at first, either. But that changed when it worked for someone I know.
Media:vo ymlq001 1 takatoshi 07.ogg Takatoshi: It's this guy called Kunihiko. He's practically always been unemployed, wastes his days away, and he owes a lot of money... like, a lot! But get this — I don't see him for a few days, and suddenly I find him dressed to the nines and feasting at a high-class restaurant!
Media:vo ymlq001 1 takatoshi 08.ogg Takatoshi: I heard it directly from him. He used this wishing ritual, and the next day he woke up to find his whole bed filled high with Mora!
Media:vo ymlq001 1 takatoshi 09.ogg Takatoshi: If you're still feeling skeptical, just ask around. There are a lot of very compelling stories about this going around these days.
Media:vo ymlq001 2 junkichi 01.ogg Junkichi: ...Grasp the thought in mind, clear like... ah, clear like the light of the moon. As close as kin with you... no, "thou"...  wait, "thee." Uh, hear my... summons, right?
Media:vo ymlq001 2 junkichi 02.ogg Junkichi: Whoa! Sheesh, you scared me. Okay, okay... Where did I leave off with the incantation, again...
Media:vo ymlq001 2 junkichi 03.ogg Junkichi: Mr. Shigeru, can you please be a little more accommodating? This is extremely important to me!
Media:vo ymlq001 2 junkichi 04.ogg Junkichi: People have had all kinds of wishes come true: become more attractive, get rich quick, ace their studies... I'm just a poor, struggling writer looking to get over a creative hurdle. Is that so much to ask?
Media:vo ymlq001 2 junkichi 05.ogg Junkichi: Anyway, I just know this is going to work. I have a gut feeling about it.
Media:vo ymlq001 2 junkichi 06.ogg Junkichi: The omamori from the shrine take too long to have any effect on your luck. Ugh, alright, enough of that, help me get this incantation down. My new book depends on it!
Media:vo ymlq001 2 junkichi 07.ogg Junkichi: Yup. It's from the one called "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits."
Media:vo ymlq001 2 junkichi 08.ogg Junkichi: No, it's most likely a self-published title. It just appeared out of nowhere and took Inazuma by storm.
Media:vo ymlq001 2 junkichi 09.ogg Junkichi: As a fellow writer, I'll refrain from passing comment on how well the story is written. But everyone is saying the wishing incantations it contains are the real deal.
Media:vo ymlq001 2 junkichi 10.ogg Junkichi: What's so surprising about that? They're probably just giddy with joy at having their wish come true!
Media:vo ymlq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: On closer inspection, it seems like there really are a lot of people talking about this kind of stuff. Hey, see those two? Paimon remembers them from the Yae Publishing House. One's an editor and the other's an author.
Media:vo ymlq001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hey, what are you guys up to?
Media:vo ymlq001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Incantation? Are you guys trying out this new wishing ritual stuff, too?
Media:vo ymlq001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wait, wait, wait.... What? This wishing ritual comes from a light novel?
Media:vo ymlq001 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hmm, this is starting to sound a little suspicious...
Media:vo ymlq001 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Why don't we go to the Grand Narukami Shrine and ask Yae Miko about it, (Traveler)?
Media:vo ymlq001 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: She's the expert when it comes to both light novels and the supernatural!
(Obtain A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits)
Media:vo ymlq001 2 shigeru 01.ogg Shigeru: No, no, it's not "hear my summons," it's "heed my summons," "heed." *sigh* You're never going to get it down at this rate.
Media:vo ymlq001 2 shigeru 02.ogg Shigeru: Junkichi is trying it out, to be specific. He's hit a bit of a creativity block recently, so I'm helping him make a wish so that he can move past it.
Media:vo ymlq001 2 shigeru 03.ogg Shigeru: I mean, I obviously don't. But Junkichi never listens to an outside opinion. So all I can do is go along with it.
Media:vo ymlq001 2 shigeru 04.ogg Shigeru: Didn't you say the same thing when you went to make your wish at the Grand Narukami Shrine? "Oh, I just know this is gonna work, I have a gut feeling about it."
Media:vo ymlq001 2 shigeru 05.ogg Shigeru: *sigh* Look, to be completely honest, I think you need to sit down and have a good think about what kind of story you wanna write. Where's all that self-confidence you had when you first started out?
Media:vo ymlq001 2 shigeru 06.ogg Shigeru: Look at you now! Trying dubious methods from any old light novel.
Media:vo ymlq001 2 shigeru 07.ogg Shigeru: Look, Junkichi... yes, everyone's saying it's real, it works, but that's only half the story. I've also heard lots of people saying that everyone who's had their wish granted using this method starts behaving strangely!
Media:vo ymlq001 3 katouyouhei 01.ogg Katou Youhei: L—Lady Guuji... what do you mean, "nothing major"? I'm begging you, you've gotta help me save my brother!
Media:vo ymlq001 3 katouyouhei 02.ogg Katou Youhei: You two seem to have a good relationship with Guuji Yae. Please, put in a good word for me, you have to convince her to help my brother!
Media:vo ymlq001 3 katouyouhei 03.ogg Katou Youhei: Here's what happened. My name is Katou Youhei, and my brother is Katou Shingo. All he's ever wanted is to become a swordmaster, so he once asked Sensei Domon of the Meikyou Shisui Art to take him on as a disciple.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 katouyouhei 04.ogg Katou Youhei: Domon turned him away. Took one look at him and said he didn't have what it takes to train in the art of the sword. But my brother wasn't about to resign himself to defeat — he trained every day as hard as he could, and finally proved himself by defeating one of Domon's best disciples in a duel recently.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 katouyouhei 05.ogg Katou Youhei: But since his victory, he's been acting extremely strange. It's like he's become a completely different person... The doctors can't find anything wrong with him, so I'm betting it must be the work of an evil spirit. That's why I'm here begging for Guuji Yae's help...
Media:vo ymlq001 3 katouyouhei 06.ogg Katou Youhei: No, Lady Guuji! If you saw him for yourself, you'd know. I guarantee you, he is not acting like someone who feels empty and lost!
Media:vo ymlq001 3 katouyouhei 07.ogg Katou Youhei: About... five days ago.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 katouyouhei 08.ogg Katou Youhei: Yes, Lady Guuji. That's a long time for him to be acting up like this. I'm really worried about him!
Media:vo ymlq001 3 katouyouhei 09.ogg Katou Youhei: Our greatest wish is to one day found our own school, just like Domon. We can't jeopardize that dream now!
Media:vo ymlq001 3 katouyouhei 10.ogg Katou Youhei: Uh... Well they're kinda two sides of the same coin, aren't they?
Media:vo ymlq001 3 katouyouhei 11.ogg Katou Youhei: Wh—What? Rumors? I... I haven't heard anything!
Media:vo ymlq001 3 katouyouhei 12.ogg Katou Youhei: Lady Guuji, please, stop changing the subject. This is someone's life we're talking about here! Please, you've gotta help me!
Media:vo ymlq001 3 katouyouhei 13.ogg Katou Youhei: Um.. r—really!?
Media:vo ymlq001 3 katouyouhei 14.ogg Katou Youhei: Not at all, never! Whatever Lady Guuji says, I trust wholeheartedly! Thank you two for your willingness to help, please follow me!
Media:vo ymlq001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Miko! Great, you're here.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Well, we were just... Uh, actually, you look kinda busy, is this a bad time?
Media:vo ymlq001 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Miko, he seems really desperate. This thing with his brother sounds really bad... Come on, you should help him.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Yay, Miko! So you're gonna help him?
Media:vo ymlq001 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Yeah! Uh, wait a sec...
Media:vo ymlq001 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Now hold on a hot second, Miko! We may be a lot of things, but we ain't exorcists!
Media:vo ymlq001 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Ugh... this feels all wrong, but you technically have a point, so...
Media:vo ymlq001 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Okay, (Traveler), let's follow Youhei and go visit his brother.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: What is going on here? Granted, you can never be quite sure what's going on in Miko's mind, but she seems even more disinterested than usual in Youhei's situation...
Media:vo ymlq001 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Well, a life's at stake here, so it looks like we'll have to deal with that first before we'll get the chance to ask her about the incantation stuff.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: Well hello there, young ones. What brings you to the shrine? It just so happens that I have a wonderful novel here. I highly recommend it.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: Oh? Well what did you want to ask?
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, no, not at all. It's nothing major.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: It really is nothing major, I stand by that. Oh, but since you're so curious, let's have him relate the story one more time, just for you.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 05.ogg Yae Miko: Hahaha... You know, there really aren't as many evil spirits lurking around as you seem to think. Your brother achieved the goal he'd been striving toward for as long as he can remember, and now it's gone. It's only natural that he feels a little empty and lost while he's trying to find a new direction.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 06.ogg Yae Miko: If it were me, I'd just leave him be for a couple of days. He'll recover on his own soon enough.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 07.ogg Yae Miko: Oh, alright, alright. Then tell me, when did your brother spar with Domon's disciple?
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 08.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... five days ago, you say...
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 09.ogg Yae Miko: Wait a minute, now I'm a little confused. Are you here to save your brother, or are you here to make your dreams of founding a martial arts school come true?
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 10.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm? Whatever. Let me ask you this, have you heard of any interesting new rumors lately? If so, I'd love to hear about them.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 11.ogg Yae Miko: Oh dear. Well, that's too bad.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 12.ogg Yae Miko: Okay, fine. Then it's decided!
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 13.ogg Yae Miko: Katou whatever-your-name-was, these two guests are trusted acquaintances of mine, and in fact they are experts in resolving all manner of strange and supernatural phenomena. Exorcisms and that sort of thing are all in a day's work for them.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 14.ogg Yae Miko: Is that hesitation that I detect in your voice? So let me get this straight, you come begging to me for help, I actually recommend someone for the job, then suddenly you start doubting me?
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 15.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, don't worry. If he wants an exorcism, just grab a handful of salt and mutter some mumbo-jumbo while you're sprinkling it around.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 16.ogg Yae Miko: It's a common trope in light novels, right? You just have to have a bit of bravado. As soon as the protagonist gains self-confidence, everything else just magically falls into place.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 17.ogg Yae Miko: Well, you were the ones who seemed concerned about his situation. Don't you think it would be a little unfair to make me do all the work?
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 18.ogg Yae Miko: Besides, we both know you wouldn't be here at the Grand Narukami Shrine unless you had a request for me, too. This is an opportunity to demonstrate that you come in good faith.
Media:vo ymlq001 3 yaemiko 19.ogg Yae Miko: Alright, let's go. Don't worry, now, I'll be coming along too.
Media:vo ymlq001 4 katouyouhei 01.ogg Katou Youhei: Hmm, how strange. My brother's been meditating here pretty much constantly over the past few days, but now he's gone!
Media:vo ymlq001 4 katouyouhei 02.ogg Katou Youhei: Yeah, it's something that he suddenly started doing after defeating Domon's disciple. He just sits there alone, talking to himself... It's pretty disturbing, actually.
Media:vo ymlq001 4 katouyouhei 03.ogg Katou Youhei: But that's not important right now! Where the heck could he have gone in his current state?
Media:vo ymlq001 4 katouyouhei 04.ogg Katou Youhei: Okay... okay, got it! I'm on it!
Media:vo ymlq001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Meditating?
Media:vo ymlq001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Miko, what about us? Shouldn't we help look for his brother, too?
Media:vo ymlq001 4 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm, this does pose a bit of a problem. If we can't find your brother, well, we can't perform an exorcism with nothing to exorcise, can we?
Media:vo ymlq001 4 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: Katou whatever-your-name-was, given the circumstances, why don't you start by going to find your brother and also picking up a handful of salt on your way. We'll need to use it during the exorcism.
Media:vo ymlq001 4 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, no need. While what's-his-face is handling that, we'll take a walk around and ask people what they know about the two brothers. Maybe we'll find out some amusing details.
Media:vo ymlq001 5 nobuo 01.ogg Nobuo: Oh, are you debt collectors? Youhei said to tell you not to worry — he'll be able to pay you back as soon as he has enrolled a few disciples...
Media:vo ymlq001 5 nobuo 02.ogg Nobuo: Well, yes, I don't think there's any disputing that. Those two don't have an ounce of dedication between them. They just hop between ideas and won't stick to anything.
Media:vo ymlq001 5 nobuo 03.ogg Nobuo: That's true, yes. Shingo begged Domon to take him on and eventually, he finally relented. But even after convincing a renowned sensei to give him a chance, he was the same as ever, bumming around in class instead of focusing on his training.
Media:vo ymlq001 5 nobuo 04.ogg Nobuo: In the end, Domon had enough and kicked him out. But Shingo was resentful about it. He blamed Domon for not seeing his potential, and even declared that he would challenge a disciple of Domon to a duel.
Media:vo ymlq001 5 nobuo 05.ogg Nobuo: Haha! Youhei said that? That Shingo trained hard? That's ridiculous, he just lay there cussing to high heaven all day, every day. Some training regimen that is.
Media:vo ymlq001 5 nobuo 06.ogg Nobuo: Youhei did tell me about Shingo winning the fight, but I took it with a grain of salt. You can ask Kenji at the village entrance more about that. He always has reliable information.
Media:vo ymlq001 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hello, Sir! We'd like to ask you about the Katou brothers.
Media:vo ymlq001 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? Debt collectors? No, no, we're not here for anything like that!
Media:vo ymlq001 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: But, uh, it sounds like Youhei and Shingo have gotten themselves into a bit of a pickle...
Media:vo ymlq001 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? But Youhei said his brother has always wanted to become a swordmaster, and even asked Domon to be his sensei.
Media:vo ymlq001 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Wait, what? That's not what we heard...
Media:vo ymlq001 5 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: Oh, how interesting. We heard a slightly different version: "My brother wasn't about to resign himself to defeat — he trained every day as hard as he could, and finally proved himself by defeating one of Domon's best disciples in a duel recently."
Media:vo ymlq001 6 katouyouhei 01.ogg Katou Youhei: Lady Guuji. Esteemed exorcists. Finally, I've found you!
Media:vo ymlq001 6 katouyouhei 02.ogg Katou Youhei: I found my brother, he's at the waterfall. And I've got the salt you asked for, too. C'mon, let's go!
Media:vo ymlq001 6 katouyouhei 03.ogg Katou Youhei: Look! Look over there! That's him, at the waterfall!
Media:vo ymlq001 6 kenji 01.ogg Kenji: Oh, you mean Shingo and Youhei?
Media:vo ymlq001 6 kenji 02.ogg Kenji: Haha, yes it's true. Wait, so are you here because you heard they're starting their own school and you're looking to sign up?
Media:vo ymlq001 6 kenji 03.ogg Kenji: Well, you've come to the right person. I actually went to watch it.
Media:vo ymlq001 6 kenji 04.ogg Kenji: I thought it was a joke when I first heard that Shingo was going to challenge a disciple of the Meikyou Shisui Art. But when he drew his sword, whoa. He became a whole different person.
Media:vo ymlq001 6 kenji 05.ogg Kenji: The way he handled his blade, it was like flowing water. Mesmerizing to watch. Domon's disciple is no pushover, but he was absolutely no match for Shingo.
Media:vo ymlq001 6 kenji 06.ogg Kenji: Yup. He seemed pretty euphoric after winning the duel, too... he was celebrating very vocally, saying something like "What a duel! I haven't felt this good in a long time!"
Media:vo ymlq001 6 kenji 07.ogg Kenji: Hmm... I'd definitely say that he has more energy than he used to. In the past, he never used to do much except lie around sunbathing all day.
Media:vo ymlq001 6 kenji 08.ogg Kenji: But just yesterday, for example, I saw him cutting down trees for the village head. In the space of one afternoon, he did what most people couldn't finish in three days. Not only that, but he managed to fell a Lavender Melon Tree with just one kick!
Media:vo ymlq001 6 kenji 09.ogg Kenji: Things got weird after that though. The village head brought out some tofu for him, and he just flipped out. He shouted: "What is that stuff!? Keep that away from me!" then ran off.
Media:vo ymlq001 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey there, we've come to ask you about the Katou brothers!
Media:vo ymlq001 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yeah! We heard that Shingo defeated an apprentice of Domon's recently. Is that true?
Media:vo ymlq001 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We're not here to sign up, but we would like to hear more details about the fight.
Media:vo ymlq001 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Is Shingo really that strong!?
Media:vo ymlq001 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: ...
Media:vo ymlq001 6 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, any other details to share? We've heard that Shingo has been behaving rather out of character since then.
Media:vo ymlq001 6 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm... Quite impressive.
Media:vo ymlq001 6 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: As much as I'd prefer to stay and hear some more delicious details, I suppose we had better be going now that he's been found.
Media:vo ymlq001 7 arakawakouji 01.ogg Arakawa Kouji: Huh... Hahahaha! Who's this? Ah, a fellow swordmaster!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 arakawakouji 02.ogg Arakawa Kouji: Come on! Fight me!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katoushingo 01.ogg Katou Shingo: ...
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katoushingo 02.ogg Katou Shingo: Wooh!... Hehehe... How's that! Can you... feel it!?
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katoushingo 03.ogg Katou Shingo: Can you feel... the feeling... of manliness!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katoushingo 04.ogg Katou Shingo: Found your own school... Hah! So shallow... How can a manly man... aspire to something... so... lame!?
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katoushingo 05.ogg Katou Shingo: ...Ugh... Please, spare me... spare me... I—I can't feel the... m—manliness... I can't even feel the cold anymore...
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katoushingo 06.ogg Katou Shingo: ...I... I can't take any more... I'm gonna die...
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katoushingo 07.ogg Katou Shingo: Youhei... Youhei! S—Save me! Save me!!!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katoushingo 08.ogg Katou Shingo: Huh? Who... Who goes there?
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 01.ogg Katou Youhei: Uhhhh...
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 02.ogg Katou Youhei: No! Don't come any closer!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 03.ogg Katou Youhei: Help!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 04.ogg Katou Youhei: Uh, I... Well, how should I know?
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 05.ogg Katou Youhei: I don't know what to tell you! I don't know!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 06.ogg Katou Youhei: Uhhh! Umm... Ummm...
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 07.ogg Katou Youhei: But I—
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 08.ogg Katou Youhei: Aaaah!!!!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 09.ogg Katou Youhei: Alright, I'll talk, I'll talk! I'll tell you everything! ...My brother and I used a wishing incantation. We made a wish!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 10.ogg Katou Youhei: Yes! Yes, that's it! The one that's all the rage right now. You just have to recite an incantation at midnight and your wish will be granted!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 11.ogg Katou Youhei: Just like the book described, we drew the magic symbol, stepped inside it barefoot at midnight, said the incantation, and lo and behold — spheres of light appeared all around us!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 12.ogg Katou Youhei: After my brother wished to become a swordmaster, it really worked — out of nowhere, he suddenly had these amazing sword skills. But his whole personality changed, too!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 13.ogg Katou Youhei: Because... I was worried that if he goes back to normal, he'll lose his skills with the sword.
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 14.ogg Katou Youhei: If that happens, it'd ruin our plans to start a martial arts school, and we'd be back to being poor. I just wanted to keep this under wraps until we'd managed to get the dojo set up and paid off our debts...
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 15.ogg Katou Youhei: Well, cause with the way he's acting now, I was worried that rumors might start spreading that he's gotten involved in the occult arts or something. And then no one would wanna sign up as his disciple!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 16.ogg Katou Youhei: So I was thinking that maybe Lady Guuji might have a way to get my brother back to normal but let him keep his sword skills...
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 17.ogg Katou Youhei: You're right, you're right! We were wrong to do what we did! We had this coming!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 18.ogg Katou Youhei: Aaaah!!! It's the s—s—spirit!!!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 katouyouhei 19.ogg Katou Youhei: Waahhh! Save me! Save me...
Media:vo ymlq001 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So this is Youhei's brother. Whoa, he's meditating while sitting in a waterfall! That's pretty wild!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hey, listen, he's talking to himself...
Media:vo ymlq001 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Did you hear that, (Traveler)? All the nonsense aside, he's calling for help!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: He stood up... and now he's coming this way!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: What do we do? (Traveler), Miko! Think of something!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: So then why'd you go to the Grand Narukami Shrine?
Media:vo ymlq001 7 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Wh—What is that!?
Media:vo ymlq001 7 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: M—Miko! He fainted! What do we do now?
Media:vo ymlq001 7 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: He's coming, (Traveler)! Be careful!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: Aww, poor thing.
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: Youhei, your brother's life is hanging in the balance, and he's using his final breaths to call on you for help. Whatever shall we do?
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: The way it looks to me is that Shingo feels terribly resentful to you about something. Would you mind telling me what that's all about?
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: You don't know? But surely you should have more insight than anyone else into how your brother came to be this way?
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 05.ogg Yae Miko: Youhei, I suggest you think very carefully before you open your mouth again. This is a life-or-death situation.
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 06.ogg Yae Miko: "Uhhh! Umm... Ummm..."? Your brother is your closest relative. You must have noticed straight away when he started acting out of character.
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 07.ogg Yae Miko: And yet five whole days pass before it occurs to you to come and seek help from me. You really expect me not to notice the gaping holes in your story?
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 08.ogg Yae Miko: As you wish. It's fine by me if you don't want to tell the truth.
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 09.ogg Yae Miko: But after Shingo dies, you'll be next.
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 10.ogg Yae Miko: It's futile trying to escape. Anywhere in the world you run to, it will be right behind your back. After all... you did summon it together.
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 11.ogg Yae Miko: My, look at you with your ingenious schemes!
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 12.ogg Yae Miko: Stop deluding yourself. These new-found sword skills are not his, they belong to the spirit that has possessed him.
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 13.ogg Yae Miko: Alright then. Your turn now, my little friend. Toss the salt, and then draw your sword.
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 14.ogg Yae Miko: See that? That's what you summoned. And look, now that Shingo's no use, it's coming straight for you.
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 15.ogg Yae Miko: We do nothing.
Media:vo ymlq001 7 yaemiko 16.ogg Yae Miko: But you, little one. Just a quick fight and this will all be over.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 arakawakouji 01.ogg Arakawa Kouji: Hehe... Hahaha... That was great, excellent! Wooh! What a rush!
Media:vo ymlq001 8 arakawakouji 02.ogg Arakawa Kouji: I haven't felt this great... in a long, long time!
Media:vo ymlq001 8 katoushingo 01.ogg Katou Shingo: *cough cough* ...What am I doing here... Youhei? Youhei, is that you?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 katoushingo 02.ogg Katou Shingo: Youhei, I had the weirdest dream...
Media:vo ymlq001 8 katoushingo 03.ogg Katou Shingo: I dreamed that I wasn't a useless loser with the sword anymore. I even beat one of Domon's disciples.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 katoushingo 04.ogg Katou Shingo: I thought we could finally open a dojo of our own now... but then I realized, I couldn't control my own body, and there was this voice in my ear talking to me constantly.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 katoushingo 05.ogg Katou Shingo: I was terrified and I wanted to take control of my body back, but I couldn't. And the voice kept talking about "manliness"...
Media:vo ymlq001 8 katoushingo 06.ogg Katou Shingo: Yes... we understand now! We won't ever do it again!
Media:vo ymlq001 8 katouyouhei 01.ogg Katou Youhei: Shingo! Are you alright?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 katouyouhei 02.ogg Katou Youhei: Shingo, we shouldn't have made that wish. We summoned a spirit and... it possessed you!
Media:vo ymlq001 8 katouyouhei 03.ogg Katou Youhei: Thank you, Lady Guuji! And thank you for your assistance, exorcism experts!
Media:vo ymlq001 8 katouyouhei 04.ogg Katou Youhei: Thank you, Lady Guuji! Thank you, exorcists!
Media:vo ymlq001 8 katouyouhei 05.ogg Katou Youhei: We'll be on our way then. Come on, Shingo.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 kuroda 01.ogg Kuroda: Lady Yae! I've finally found you.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 kuroda 02.ogg Kuroda: I'm here to report on Yae Publishing House's sales for the last month. All the numbers are here, please take a look.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 kuroda 03.ogg Kuroda: Yes. "Overall Bestseller," "Reader's Favorite," and "Trending Ranking"... We're being beaten in all categories!
Media:vo ymlq001 8 kuroda 04.ogg Kuroda: One book is topping all the charts... It's called "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits."
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: He... disappeared. But he looked pretty content at the end there.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh, well, Paimon sure is confused. Do you know what that was all about, (Traveler)?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Miko, would they really have lost their lives if we hadn't gotten involved?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: And if so... why the heck were you so reluctant to help out!?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So... what was it that possessed Shingo?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Ah! Paimon's got it! It was an oni!
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Huh... Fair enough, but it seems like it had the opposite effect.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Whew... Well, the main thing is that nobody got hurt.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Hold on, Miko! You say everything's wrapped up, but are you sure about that?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Actually, that book's the whole reason we came looking for you at the shrine today. Incantations seem really popular right now.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: That's not the point! The problem is that the incantations in the book are actually capable of summoning spirits and stuff! And loads of people are trying it!
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: But who wrote this book, and why? Don't we think there might be a bigger safety risk here?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: What do you think, (Traveler)?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 14a.ogg Paimon: Yeah... Youhei and Shingo may have been fine in the end, but things got pretty scary when Shingo was possessed.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 14b.ogg Paimon: Well, when you put it that way... She has been pretty trustworthy so far. She said from the beginning that it wasn't anything major, and so far, there hasn't been any big danger.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 14c.ogg Paimon: You're right. Big events in the light novel market should be at the center of her attention, surely? But she doesn't seem to care about this book at all.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Miko, what is it? You have a really scary look on your face right now.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Huh? How is this our problem all of a sudden?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Wait... what just happened... Again, you technically have a point, but... this feels all wrong!
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: Ah, we can talk about it later. They're about to wake up.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: Yes, and had we not come to your rescue, your life would've been over before too much longer. Then, the spirit would have haunted your brother until he died of fatigue, too.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: Alright, take him to get some rest. He's very weak right now, having been possessed for quite a few days.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: He will experience a high fever, but it won't be fatal. Remember, this is the price you pay.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 05.ogg Yae Miko: At this point, I would normally lecture you on the dire consequences of using occult methods to obtain power that does not belong to you... but I think you get the picture now, don't you?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 06.ogg Yae Miko: Ugh, they would've been fine.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 07.ogg Yae Miko: I had to scare them a little, though. Otherwise I hardly think these two lazy rascals would have learned their lesson.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 08.ogg Yae Miko: You saw it all for yourselves. I'm sure you can figure out what kind of spirit had possessed him, can't you?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 09.ogg Yae Miko: Correct. Although it possessed Shingo, it didn't have any ill intentions. As a matter of fact, it actually seemed like it was trying to train Shingo to become bolder.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 10.ogg Yae Miko: Tossing salt caused it to temporarily leave Shingo's body. Then, you exhausted its strength by fighting it, so it disappeared.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 11.ogg Yae Miko: Even if we'd done nothing at all, Shingo would have eventually become too weak for his body to host the spirit, and it would have left of its own accord.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 12.ogg Yae Miko: Of course, it would have been more stressful for Shingo and Youhei that way, hehe. Still, the experience may ultimately have been more effective than me scaring them into submission with a little exaggeration.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 13.ogg Yae Miko: Alright, seems like we've wrapped up everything here. Come on, off we go.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 14.ogg Yae Miko: Hmm? You mean you disagree?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 15.ogg Yae Miko: Oh, you mean that they got the incantation from that book. Yes, I know the one.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 16.ogg Yae Miko: Human beings don't have powers like us youkai. It's quite understandable for them to be interested in incantations to summon the supernatural.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 17.ogg Yae Miko: Ugh, even then, humans only have so much strength. Even if they do successfully summon a spirit with the incantation, it won't stay with them for very long. I really wouldn't fret about it.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 18.ogg Yae Miko: Kuroda? What are you doing here?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 19.ogg Yae Miko: Let me see... What? We're losing market share?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 20.ogg Yae Miko: Both of you, back here, now!
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 21.ogg Yae Miko: Things just got serious. "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" is an all-round hit, summarily beating the novels of the Yae Publishing House by every analysis.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 22.ogg Yae Miko: Just what is that supposed to mean!? I worked extremely hard to promote our latest featured work, and now a rival book comes out of nowhere and steals our thunder! If this isn't the very definition of intolerable, I don't know what is.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 23.ogg Yae Miko: I have to come up with a counter plan. And you are going to help me.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 24.ogg Yae Miko: Paimon, please. "Who wrote this book, and why? Don't we think there might be a bigger safety risk here?"
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 25.ogg Yae Miko: *sigh* Am I to take it that the safety of the people of Inazuma isn't so important in your eyes after all?
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 26.ogg Yae Miko: Nothing's wrong, okay? Come on. We're going to war.
Media:vo ymlq001 8 yaemiko 27.ogg Yae Miko: I'm going to head back and make some preparations. Meet me outside the Yae Publishing House.
