 (But doesn't that just make Sayu even more suspicious?)
 (Don't tell me she left her tail sticking out again!)
 (Of course Sayu wouldn't hurt me...)
 (Seems there's no fooling her...)
 (What a relief...)
 ...What's the real reason?
 Alright, fine.
 Ambushing, huh? That's sticky business.
 But I'm not your target, right?
 But why all the running? And what's with all those lame excuses just now?
 By the way, I've caught word that the Yashiro Commission has supposedly dispatched someone to ambush me.
 Do you know me?
 Don't worry, I understand. Let's go.
 Don't worry, I'll give you some hair and other evidence to report back with.
 Good thing we didn't have any other plans.
 Good thing you didn't fall asleep.
 Hey, you have to help me out here.
 I happened to be in the area. Do you come here often?
 I see. Go on...
 I suppose I'll just have a chat with the shrine maiden, then.
 I want to ask around and get to the bottom of this.
 I was about to ask you the same thing.
 I've just got an unusual feeling that someone's following me.
 Is it possible that a ninja could have gone rogue? You know, a ninja like Sayu...
 It seems you are looking for something.
 Just pretend that you've already finished the job.
 Maybe he's up to something.
 Maybe there's a way we can get his attention?
 No, I've just... heard things.
 No, not at all. I'm just making an example, that's all.
 No, of course not.
 No.
 Oh, you've heard of me?
 Perhaps I'll tell Kamisato Ayaka that I ran into you here.
 Quest DescriptionAs you walk through Inazuma City, you feel a strange gaze from somewhere around you.
 So we know that Kano Nana isn't behind your mission, is there anyone else you can think of?
 Someone informed me that this might be happening. I've been on my guard.
 Thank you, that would certainly help.
(Proceed to Branch 1)
 That makes him a likely suspect.
 That's even more suspicious.
 Then I expect you to answer honestly.
 Then let's go ask her about it.
 Uh, no... No, I haven't.
 Well, if your tail wasn't sticking out...
 Well, you were a great help to us before. What's really concerning is whatever's behind these orders of yours.
 Weren't you looking for me just now?
 While you are making inquiries, I shall continue investigating on my own, just to be safe.
(Proceed to Branch 2)
 Who is the "shrine maiden" you mentioned earlier?
 Why?
 Yes, absolutely certain.
After a while, Sayu finally returns.
Kano Nana leaves.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Aw, you saw right through my disguise...
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Odd... Even the shrine maiden often struggles to find me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Huh? My tail was sticking out!?
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: *sigh* I must have been too nervous and failed to fully utilize my ninjutsu technique.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: So, uh, what do you need?
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: Well, uh... I heard that Shimura's added a delicious new dish to their menu.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: And Yae Publishing House has some good light novels... Oh, and a dip in Aisa Bathhouse is always nice.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: So uh, you know...
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: Today's weather is perfect for... all that stuff.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: ...So, what can I do for you?
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: No really, I'm not up to anything. I'm just a little tired and thought I could use a good nap.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: I'll be going now. Don't bother chasing me again, you won't be able to catch me anyway.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: Oh no, anything but that!
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: *sigh* You're just as difficult as the shrine maiden. C'mon just let me go, would you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: Oh, fine. But if I tell you the truth, I don't wanna hear any complaints, no matter how crazy the truth may seem.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: So you know I'm in the Shuumatsuban, right? Well, it's our job to take care of matters that are "inconvenient" to the higher-ups.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: Which sometimes includes ambushing people.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: Huh? Doesn't that intimidate you even a little bit?
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 19.ogg Sayu: You do know what that means, right? And still no reaction, huh? Don't tell me it's because of my height.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 20.ogg Sayu: Anyway, being ambushed is pretty scary. You should at least try to express a little concern.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 21.ogg Sayu: Uh actually, according to my orders, you are... Though I have no intention of really attacking you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 22.ogg Sayu: I don't get it, they never assign me this kind of mission. There's loads of other suitable operatives.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 23.ogg Sayu: All this craziness is starting to interfere with my sleep schedule. I just dropped by to see how you were doing. I was glad to see that you're okay.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 24.ogg Sayu: I was worried about how you'd react...
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 25.ogg Sayu: I mean, who knows what you'd do if you knew that I was out to ambush you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 26.ogg Sayu: Yet, when I told you, you didn't so much as flinch. I guess that actually made me feel a lot better.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 27.ogg Sayu: Who do you want to talk to? Someone in the Yashiro Commission?
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 28.ogg Sayu: She's the one who's been assigned to supervise my work. She always tries to catch me whenever I'm slacking off. Basically, it's her duty to keep me from napping.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 29.ogg Sayu: But... she would probably know more about the origins of my mission.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 30.ogg Sayu: Fine... I'll take you to her, but I'll have to hide somewhere in the distance. If she catches me anywhere near there, I'll never hear the end of it.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 31.ogg Sayu: And then they'll sentence me to all kinds of work, which'll really cut into my time for napping.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 32.ogg Sayu: Please, she's quite perceptive. You mustn't tell her that you've seen me anywhere.
Media:vo zycop001 1901204 sayu 33.ogg Sayu: You got that? We have a deal, no word about me."
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 01.ogg Kano Nana: *sigh* Where has she run off to this time...
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 02.ogg Kano Nana: Hm? I didn't expect to see you here. You're (Traveler), right? It's a pleasure to meet you.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 03.ogg Kano Nana: Yes, Miss Kamisato has spoken of you before. You seemed familiar. It appears my intuitions were correct.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 04.ogg Kano Nana: May I ask what brings you here?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 05.ogg Kano Nana: It just so happens I'm looking for a little child by the name of Sayu.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 06.ogg Kano Nana: She's a ninja with a nasty habit of disappearing the moment I turn around. *sigh* She's always neglectful of her duties.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 07.ogg Kano Nana: She often comes here to take a nap, but it seems she's already predicted that I would come looking for her.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 08.ogg Kano Nana: You haven't happened to see her anywhere, have you? She's wearing a mujina costume, pretty hard to miss.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 09.ogg Kano Nana: Really?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 10.ogg Kano Nana: Well then, I suppose I'll just have to keep searching for her.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 11.ogg Kano Nana: Oh? How could that be?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 12.ogg Kano Nana: How did you catch wind of this? Did you encounter the ninja tasked with the matter?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 13.ogg Kano Nana: Huh... Well, I'm sure there's no need to worry. You're probably just overthinking things.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 14.ogg Kano Nana: After all, you have been of great service to the Yashiro Commission and many are thankful for your actions. How could anyone even consider dispatching a ninja to attack you?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 15.ogg Kano Nana: Like Sayu? You mean to say that this matter is related to Sayu?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 16.ogg Kano Nana: There's absolutely no need to worry about Sayu. If anything, she's extremely loyal and would never act presumptuously.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 17.ogg Kano Nana: Though she often neglects her duties as a ninja and seems to never heed instructions, she's certainly not one to go against our principles.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 18.ogg Kano Nana: Given her age, such portentous tasks are not assigned to her.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 19.ogg Kano Nana: What's the matter? Are you still worried?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 20.ogg Kano Nana: Alright, just to be sure, I shall personally inquire about this matter with the Yashiro Commission.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 21.ogg Kano Nana: Though I am the shrine maiden, it is also part of my duties to take on work from the Shuumatsuban.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 22.ogg Kano Nana: I'll be sure to look into it. I'm curious myself what could be the cause of such absurd rumors.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 23.ogg Kano Nana: My intuition tells me that Sayu's mischief might be behind this whole misunderstanding.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 24.ogg Kano Nana: Are you completely certain that you haven't seen her around recently?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 25.ogg Kano Nana: Hmm...
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 26.ogg Kano Nana: Aha! Sayu, I can see you. Come out from there!
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 27.ogg Kano Nana: Don't even think about trying to sneak away. Come over here, this instant!
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 28.ogg Kano Nana: Hmm, it does appear that Sayu has really been given a mission to ambush you... Which wasn't assigned by me, of course.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 29.ogg Kano Nana: I apologize, (Traveler). I'm afraid I did not treat this matter with due sincerity.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 30.ogg Kano Nana: I shall take these orders back to the Yashiro Commission for further clarification.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 31.ogg Kano Nana: Ahem! Sayu!
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 32.ogg Kano Nana: Where do you think you're off to? You have ninjutsu training to complete, so you shall return with me to Chinju Forest.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 33.ogg Kano Nana: You're coming with me, even if I have to carry you, Sayu. Is that what you want?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 34.ogg Kano Nana: Ugh... I honestly hope you are not up to something again, Sayu.
(Proceed to Give It Up!)
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 kanonana 35.ogg Kano Nana: Yes, of course. I'm sorry that this matter has taken up so much of your time. I'll be sure to look into it and get back to you as soon as possible.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Good... Well if there's nothing left for me to do then I'll be...
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Oh, uh, y—yes!
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Yes, but you know, an exceptional ninja must not only work hard, but also have ample rest. *yawn* It happens to be time for my nap, so I'll see you next time... Goodbye and good night.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: Oh, n—no need. I'm sorry, I'll come quietly.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: In which case... (Traveler), will you come with us, too?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: I promise there won't be any trouble. I need a bit of your time, that's all.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: I helped you by bringing you to the shrine maiden, so now you need to return the favor.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: Whew, that was close. Thanks for not ratting me out.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: Hey, even I find it hard to sleep through a tense moment like that.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 10.ogg Sayu: Hmm, I don't know where else to start...
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 11.ogg Sayu: Oh, but there is one official guy who is responsible for delivering orders from the Yashiro Commission to the Shuumatsuban. Anyone with missions like this will report directly to him.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 12.ogg Sayu: But I never receive those kind of missions, so I've hardly ever spoken to him before.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 13.ogg Sayu: Oh, so what should I do?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 14.ogg Sayu: Huh!? B—But, I can't do that... I mean, I—I can't even squish an Onikabuto, there's no way I...
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 15.ogg Sayu: Oh wait, you said pretend, didn't you? You almost scared my tail off... But even so, I'm a lousy liar...
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 16.ogg Sayu: Oh, I get it. We'll take the evidence, stuff it in a bag, and write my name on it. Then, all I need to do is put it in the big box used for reports and wait for him to see it. I'm sure he'll come looking for me.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 17.ogg Sayu: *yawn* But that's a lot to do, and it's really far away.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 18.ogg Sayu: Oh fine, I guess my nap will have to wait till later. Just stay put, okay? I'll be back in no time.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 19.ogg Sayu: *panting* It's me, I'm back... Whew, what a trip.
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 20.ogg Sayu: Your evidence caught his attention right away. Then he asked me to go someplace to meet him outside. Strange, why wouldn't we just meet at the Police Station?
Media:vo zycop001 1901205 sayu 21.ogg Sayu: Let's go to the meeting point, I want to settle this quickly so I can finally curl up for a nice, long nap.
(Proceed to Shuumatsuban Suspicions)
Observe: (Hm? What's that strange-looking thing?)
(The "barrel" transforms into Sayu)
Observe: (Nope, she doesn't seem to be around here.)
Observe: (There doesn't seem to be anything of particular interest here, let's go have a look somewhere else.)
Observe: (This appears to be just an ordinary pile of junk. Someone will likely come by to clean it up soon.)
Seeing Sayu walk up gloomily, Kano Nana understands what going on.
Thoughts: (Huh?)
(The camera zooms on Sayu, who disappears from Traveler's sight)
Thoughts: (Let's go follow her, maybe we can find out what's going on.)
Thoughts: (Perhaps she's using her ninjutsu skills to hide. Hmm, let's have a look around the area.)
Thoughts: (She's nowhere to be seen...)
Thoughts: (Was that... Sayu? What's she doing running around here?)
Thoughts: (We saw her only a moment ago, she couldn't have gone too far off.)
