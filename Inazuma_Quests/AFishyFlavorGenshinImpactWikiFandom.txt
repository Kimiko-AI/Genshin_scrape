Neko: You have returned. Have you fed those rascals?
 Yes.
Neko: Good, good. You have my thanks. Without your aid, those children would have played and played... and then they would have gone hungry outside.
Neko: *sigh* What a bunch of disobedient children. How will they be fit to receive the people coming to the shrine this way...

Neko: You have returned. It is strange. Those children suddenly all came back, and they looked mighty frightened, too.
Neko: Did they meet some hairy churls outside, the ones with the sticks?
Neko: Still, they did come back... Wait, what is the matter with you?
 Uh, actually, I...
Neko: ...You... unfathomable human! What possessed you to do that?
Neko: You could simply have played with these children the normal way...
Neko: Meow! No wonder they were so frightened... You must go and comfort them.
Neko: Really, now. I suppose it was a bit much to ask for all humans to be like Hibiki...

Paimon: Wait! What are you doing!?
Paimon: Ugh, now they've all run away! ...Th—They're gonna tell on us to Neko, aren't they...

Paimon: Well, looks like the kittens have all gathered around.
Paimon: Paimon wonders if Neko's given them all names or not...
 Alright then.
Paimon: Let's pass our map to Neko to mark out, shall we?
 Do you need any help?
 Here's our map...
 Need us to go look for them?
 Quest Description"Neko," the Asase Shrine's provisionary head priestess, seems to be troubled about something...
 Uh, actually, I...
 What's wrong?
 Yes.
Neko starts to mark the map...
Neko: *sigh* What a bunch of disobedient children. How will they be fit to receive the people coming to the shrine this way...
Neko: ...You... unfathomable human! What possessed you to do that?
Neko: Ah, it's you. Those little ones have run off yet again. They really are growing most rebellious...
Neko: Alright then. Go now, and quickly. I have matters of the shrine to attend to yet.
Neko: Bring those fish to the little ones, and quickly. I have matters of the shrine to attend to yet.
Neko: But if they should go overboard and go hungry from when the suns hangs high to when the moon comes up... That would not be good either.
Neko: Did they meet some hairy churls outside, the ones with the sticks?
Neko: Good, good. You have my thanks. Without your aid, those children would have played and played... and then they would have gone hungry outside.
Neko: It is not a bad thing, perhaps, for them to go a little wild outside, lest they make a fool of themselves in front of the humans and disgrace the shrine.
Neko: Meow! No wonder they were so frightened... You must go and comfort them.
Neko: Mmm, it seems that you do not lack comprehension...
Neko: Now that you have hung those metal balls around the shrine, I believe that they will be able to find their way back.
Neko: Really, now. I suppose it was a bit much to ask for all humans to be like Hibiki...
Neko: Still, they did come back... Wait, what is the matter with you?
Neko: Well then, please bring these fish to those little rascals so that they may eat.
Neko: What an unteachable lot...
Neko: You could simply have played with these children the normal way...
Neko: You have returned. Have you fed those rascals?
Neko: You have returned. It is strange. Those children suddenly all came back, and they looked mighty frightened, too.
