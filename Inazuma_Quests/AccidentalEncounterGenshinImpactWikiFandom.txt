Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 09a.ogg Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 09b.ogg Gorou: (Traveler)'s not going to fall for it. We've fought side by side!

Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 12.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe. Gorou, now do you understand how appealing your tail is?
 Actually, Yae Miko's not all bad...

 Are you okay?
 Are you sure that will work?
 Do you know Yae Miko well?
 Don't bully Gorou!

 I can't help you this time.
 I completely agree.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 25.ogg Gorou: Okay, so let's reply along those lines.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 26.ogg Gorou: Let me think... how about this: "It is good that you want to repay your neighbor's kindness, but be aware that you can find other ways to do this that don't involve lending them money. Right now, the most important thing for you to do is demand your money back. Being kind does not mean allowing your neighbor to walk all over you."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 27.ogg Gorou: And we are done with that letter. The next one seems longer, let me see...
 I'll go keep watch at Yae Publishing House.

 Is it someone you know?
 It sounds like she's falling ill.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 16.ogg Gorou: Hmmm... I think so too.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 17.ogg Gorou: Many soldiers have developed similar symptoms in the past when we march in the rain. It's easy to catch a cold in wet weather.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 18.ogg Gorou: I've taken care of ill soldiers personally in the past, so I know this problem well.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 19.ogg Gorou: Hmm, I'll reply: "The temperature has dropped recently, and it's likely that you've caught a cold. Taking medicine will be an important part of your recovery, but don't overlook the importance of keeping warm and getting plenty of rest, too."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 20.ogg Gorou: I think that should do... Come on, let's read the next letter.
 It sounds like she's falling in love.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Hmm... Well, I don't know what it's like to be in love, but if you say so, (Traveler), I think it makes sense.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: I'll reply like this then: "It's likely that the feelings you're experiencing right now won't occur many times in your life. I urge you to summon the courage to seize this opportunity and see where it takes you — no matter where that may be."
 More professional than I expected...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: What? Really?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: But that's how it is in battle, too. Opportunities to seize victory are fleeting — when they arise, you have to capitalize on them right away.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 15.ogg Gorou: I imagine it's the same in love? That's my suggestion, anyway... Come on, let's read the next letter.
 It's okay, let's just ignore her.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 33.ogg Gorou: You're right. I've heard Her Excellency say the same thing before — in any battle, you need to think about how to avoid your shortcomings. As long as I don't come into contact with Yae Miko, everything should be fine.
 Actually, Yae Miko's not all bad...

 No problem.
 Perhaps take a softer tone...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 28.ogg Gorou: That makes sense, too. Giving the neighbor an ultimatum would likely harm the relationship between them.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 29.ogg Gorou: But the letter also makes it clear that no matter how many hints the writer gives him, the neighbor won't return the money...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 30.ogg Gorou: In that case, how about we reply like this:
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 31.ogg Gorou: "Why not ask to borrow some money from your neighbor? Any sum he agrees to lend you can be used to offset the amount he owes. Even if he refuses to lend to you, at least by asking to borrow from him, you are sending him the message that your own financial position is far from optimal, and he will be unlikely to ask you for money again in the near future."
 Are you sure that will work?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 32.ogg Gorou: I don't know. But it's worth a try. The most important thing is to muster the courage to resist, and not give the other person the impression that you are someone they can take advantage of.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 33.ogg Gorou: And we are done with this letter. The next one seems longer, let me see...
 Quest DescriptionYou meet Gorou and Yae Miko near Yae Publishing House. Gorou seems to be somewhat troubled...
 Step DescriptionGorou would like to finish writing replies to his readers, and you decide to help him out.
 Then I'll pretend to be a merchant!

 Why don't I help you overcome this weakness?

Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 19.ogg Gorou: To be honest, this is something that's always worried me. If the soldiers ever saw me in this kind of embarrassing situation, they'd be very disappointed.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 20.ogg Gorou: So, I have to overcome it. For their sake.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 21.ogg Gorou: As soon as I've worked through this, let's go take on Yae Miko again!
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 22.ogg Gorou: First things first, though. Do you have any ideas on where to begin, (Traveler)?

 You'll have to answer this one, Gorou.

Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 aratani 02.ogg Aratani: We have selected a very skilled artist to be in charge. I'm confident that the finished products will be to your satisfaction...

Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: How do you kn— Ahem!
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: Really?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Wait, no, why are we still on this topic...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: In fact, why am I even here talking about tails with you in the first place?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: Argh, I'm trapped... how do I get out of this...

Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: Hey! Not you too...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: There was definitely something strange about the way she looked at me at the end there... Could she be plotting something?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: Sorry that you had to see that. The real reason I'm here at Yae Publishing House is to buy some books for Her Excellency.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 13.ogg Gorou: Since Watatsumi Island signed a peace treaty with the Shogunate, we've had much closer contact than we did before.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 14.ogg Gorou: I also wanted to come and see what things are like in an area ruled by the Shogunate. I hadn't counted on running into her...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 15.ogg Gorou: I've interacted with her a few times before, but I can't say I've ever gotten used to it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 16.ogg Gorou: I've never been good at dealing with people like her. The way she towers over me, and speaks so cryptically... something about her is strangely intimidating...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 17.ogg Gorou: I could probably deal with her in battle, but I don't know where to start when I run into her in normal life. I guess this is a weakness of mine.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 18.ogg Gorou: Really? That would be great.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 19.ogg Gorou: To be honest, this is something that's always worried me. If the soldiers ever saw me in this kind of embarrassing situation, they'd be very disappointed.

Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 23.ogg Gorou: I see. So if you pretend to be someone like her, I can keep practicing on you.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 24.ogg Gorou: If I can get the better of you, then I'll be able to hold my own when similar situations come up in the future.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 25.ogg Gorou: Good plan! Let's see... Where should we start?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 26.ogg Gorou: Now that you mention it, I remember having a similar experience back on Watatsumi Island.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 27.ogg Gorou: I was with my subordinates at the time. We ran into a merchant, I got caught up talking to them, and I don't quite know what happened, but I ended up buying a lot of things from them.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 28.ogg Gorou: I think we can give it a try. There's an island called Ritou nearby — why don't we go there?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 29.ogg Gorou: I heard all the outlander merchants are based there, so it might help to create the right atmosphere.

Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 30.ogg Gorou: Good plan.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 31.ogg Gorou: Start by studying some theory, address the fear at its root, and then I'll have nothing to be afraid of.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 32.ogg Gorou: But where would I go to learn about this? I wouldn't know anyone on Narukami Island... Oh! Let's go back to Watatsumi Island and ask around there.

Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 33.ogg Gorou: You're right. I've heard Her Excellency say the same thing before — in any battle, you need to think about how to avoid your shortcomings. As long as I don't come into contact with Yae Miko, everything should be fine.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 34.ogg Gorou: Okay, whatever you think's best. Let's avoid Yae Publishing House for now.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 35.ogg Gorou: Actually, there's something else I have to sort out while I'm on Narukami Island. It's a personal matter.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 36.ogg Gorou: Back when we were fighting the Shogun's Army at Nazuchi Beach, I had a box with me that contained some very important items.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 37.ogg Gorou: The odds were stacked against us that day, and the resistance was forced to retreat. I had to abandon the box, but I managed to quickly bury it first.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 38.ogg Gorou: I went back to collect it on this trip, but it turned out someone had already dug it up. So I asked around the area, and the locals said that apparently, the Adventurers' Guild had beaten me to it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 39.ogg Gorou: That box is very important to me. I have to get it back from the Adventurers' Guild. Would you mind coming along?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 40.ogg Gorou: Thank you so much. Let's head right over — time is of the essence.
(Proceed to Ordinary Memorial)
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 41.ogg Gorou: Really? Phew, well, it's a relief to hear that.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 42.ogg Gorou: In that case, I still have some business to take care of with the Yae Publishing House.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 43.ogg Gorou: They run a monthly magazine called "That's Life," which has an advice column. Readers write in about their problems, and I'm responsible for responding to them.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 44.ogg Gorou: I'm not quite sure why they chose me, but it's my job now, and I can't give it up just like that.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 45.ogg Gorou: Yae Miko just handed me the latest batch of readers' letters. Let's find a place to write the replies, then pack them up and send them back to Yae Publishing House.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 gorou 46.ogg Gorou: Don't be ridiculous! I'm a high-ranking general of Watatsumi Island, how could I do such a thing!
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: I really can't recommend that store highly enough. A couple more visits, and you'll find that the fur on your tail is silky-smooth.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: A gorgeous tail like yours deserves lots of tender loving care. Hehe... don't you agree?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: You say that... but do I see your ears saying otherwise?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: Although your tail isn't professionally maintained, the fur doesn't look dry and coarse. To me, this says you like to take care of it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 05.ogg Yae Miko: I'm also guessing that you like to curl up into a fetal position and hug your fluffy tail tight as you go off to sleep.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 06.ogg Yae Miko: It's okay, there's no need to be embarrassed. The desire to cuddle up to a soft tail while sleeping is quite natural.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 07.ogg Yae Miko: Why... Because you are blessed with a wonderful fluffy tail, that's why. I think it's very cute.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 08.ogg Yae Miko: Oh? And how is my favorite little one doing, hmm?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 09.ogg Yae Miko: I didn't expect to meet you here. We were just talking about tails...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 10.ogg Yae Miko: Gorou has a beautiful tail, don't you think? Doesn't it make you want to stroke it?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 11.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, don't be nervous. Just follow your heart's desire.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 12.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe. Gorou, now do you understand how appealing your tail is?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 13.ogg Yae Miko: I'll take a look later, and if everything's in order, place it in front of the store.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 14.ogg Yae Miko: Alright, I won't tease the two of you any further.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 15.ogg Yae Miko: Do make the most of your trip here, won't you? Quite a lot has changed.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901801 yaemiko 16.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe... I wish you both a fun-filled time on Narukami Island.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: This place looks nice and quiet.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Why don't we write the replies here? The sooner I get them finished and handed back to the publisher, the sooner we can go do something else.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: I just hope I don't have another run-in with you-know-who at Yae Publishing House later...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: Anyway, the writing could take me some time. The questions I receive are often so strange that I have to think long and hard about how to best answer them.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: Great. Let's write the replies together. I'm actually interested to hear your perspective.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: Let me see here... hmm, let's start with this one.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: "Today, a new guy came to our village. He was good-looking and had a lovely voice."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: "When I peeked at him from behind the door, I felt my cheeks getting hotter, and my heart started beating faster and faster..."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: See, I can tell right away that this is exactly the kind of question I'm no good at dealing with. The letter seems to be from a young lady... which is not a demographic where I can offer much expertise...
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 10.ogg Gorou: (Traveler), what's your take?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 11.ogg Gorou: Hmm... Well, I don't know what it's like to be in love, but if you say so, (Traveler), I think it makes sense.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 12.ogg Gorou: I'll reply like this then: "It's likely that the feelings you're experiencing right now won't occur many times in your life. I urge you to summon the courage to seize this opportunity and see where it takes you — no matter where that may be."

Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 16.ogg Gorou: Hmmm... I think so too.

Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 20.ogg Gorou: I think that should do... Come on, let's read the next letter.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 21.ogg Gorou: "My neighbor is always borrowing money from me, but never seems to be able to pay me back on time. I have tried subtly raising the issue in conversation several times, but he always finds a way to dodge my questions..."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 22.ogg Gorou: "He was kind to me when I was young. I don't want to make things ugly, but the money issue bothers me a lot. Please help me."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 23.ogg Gorou: If this is a dispute between neighbors, it must be settled as soon as possible. It's like when conflict arises between generals in the army — the proper policy is to resolve it without delay.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 24.ogg Gorou: The most important thing in military regulations is fairness. It is only right to pay back a debt. I want to suggest that the writer demands their money back in no uncertain terms. Do you think it makes sense?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 25.ogg Gorou: Okay, so let's reply along those lines.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 26.ogg Gorou: Let me think... how about this: "It is good that you want to repay your neighbor's kindness, but be aware that you can find other ways to do this that don't involve lending them money. Right now, the most important thing for you to do is demand your money back. Being kind does not mean allowing your neighbor to walk all over you."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 27.ogg Gorou: And we are done with that letter. The next one seems longer, let me see...

Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 34.ogg Gorou: "Hello, I was born on Narukami Island and I'm now a soldier in the resistance..."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 35.ogg Gorou: So this is from one of my troops?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 36.ogg Gorou: Most likely. But I'm not sure who.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 37.ogg Gorou: Before passing any readers' letters on to me, Yae Publishing House has their staff copy each one by hand and redact all names in the process.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 38.ogg Gorou: So I can't be sure who exactly this is... anyway, let's keep reading.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 39.ogg Gorou: "I couldn't turn a blind eye to the Vision Hunt Decree, and my anger drove me to join the resistance. My comrades and I have fought side by side, and I have formed deep friendships with them."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 40.ogg Gorou: "Since we achieved our goal and the war came to an end, I have remained on Watatsumi Island. But this is not my hometown, and I often find myself dreaming of the cherry blossoms falling on Narukami Island."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 41.ogg Gorou: "I now don't know whether to stay here or return home. The resistance has treated me well, and I've long been disillusioned by the Shogunate, but my hometown tugs constantly at my heartstrings..."
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 42.ogg Gorou: How should I reply to him, (Traveler)?
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 43.ogg Gorou: Let me think about it.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 44.ogg Gorou: To be blunt, I obviously don't want any soldiers under my command to leave.
Media:vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 45.ogg Gorou: But, if making them stay causes them pain... how are my actions any different from the Vision Hunt Decree?
