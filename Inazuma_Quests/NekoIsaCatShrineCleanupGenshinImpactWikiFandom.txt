 Actually, could I ask who Hibiki was?
Neko: Hibiki is Hibiki. She is the head priestess of the Asase Shrine.
 And your name...
Neko: My name is Neko — a name bestowed by Hibiki.
Neko: It was she who often came out to receive guests at the shrine, and so I was not obligated to manage such affairs.
Neko: I had neither name nor title then. I slept where she wished, and played with whoever she willed.
Neko: One day, Hibiki said that she would call me "Neko," on account of my habit of sleeping.
Neko: Hibiki is presently absent, but a shrine is no shrine without a head priestess, and so I have taken up that post.
Neko: That is also why I hope to restore the shrine to its former liveliness before Hibiki returns.
Neko: ...That's right! Once she returns, I can fall asleep in her bosom, and not have to wait for her to repair the Offering Box, or wait for her to use that long stick of hers to clear the leaves.
Neko: Well, I shall leave those tasks to you. There are some sneaky bugs that have stolen into the shrine, and they must now be driven out.
 And your name...
 Domeki?
Neko: A very tall and loud human. He and Hibiki would play together a great deal.
 Don't you worry about it.
 Everything's spick and span.
 It could use some cleanup...
 It's a little messy...
 Quest DescriptionNeko, "Provisional Head Priestess of the Asase Shrine," seems to have business with you...
 Snicker-snack?
Paimon: Neko probably means trimming the branches.
 So, about your name...
Neko: My name is Neko — a name bestowed by Hibiki.
Neko: It was she who often came out to receive guests at the shrine, and so I was not obligated to manage such affairs.
Neko: I had neither name nor title then. I slept where she wished, and played with whomever she willed.
Neko: One day, Hibiki said that she would call me "Neko," on account of my habit of sleeping.
Neko: Hibiki is presently absent, but a shrine is no shrine without a head priestess, and so I have taken up that post.
Neko: That is also why I hope to restore the shrine to its former liveliness before Hibiki returns.
Neko: Once she returns, I can fall asleep in her bosom, and not have to wait for her to repair the Offering Box, or for her to use that long stick of hers to clear the fallen leaves.
Neko: Well, I shall leave those tasks to you. There are some sneaky bugs that have stolen into the shrine, and they must now be driven out.
 So, who used to tidy the shrine?
Neko: It was Hibiki. Domeki would help her sometimes, too.
Neko: Hibiki often took that stick and waved it back and forth before sunrise. She would also pour water on the ground. Ugh, water...
Neko: Wait. Did she pour the water first? I do not quite recall the sequence of events...
Neko: Domeki would come by at times as well, and he would use crossed metal plates to go snicker-snack! And the branches and leaves would come falling down.
 Such familiar work, eh...
 Uh, that's not how that works...
 What do you need swept?
 What exactly do you need done?
Neko: ...That's right! Once she returns, I can fall asleep in her bosom, and not have to wait for her to repair the Offering Box, or wait for her to use that long stick of hers to clear the leaves.
Neko: A very tall and loud human. He and Hibiki would play together a great deal.
Neko: Ah, but if one yet recalls clearly, Hibiki used to use a long stick with pointy ends to build a pile of leaves. Now, if she did it, it must be the right thing to do.
Neko: Ah, yes. You may forgo the snicker-snacking. I like the branches just the way they are.
Neko: Ah, you return. The box you repaired has proved its efficacy quite well.
Neko: And what of my shrine?
Neko: But now that I am the provisional head priestess, such churlish behavior shall not do.
Neko: Domeki would come by at times as well, and he would use crossed metal plates to go snicker-snack! And the branches and leaves would come falling down.
Neko: Hibiki is Hibiki. She is the head priestess of the Asase Shrine.
Neko: Hibiki is presently absent, but a shrine is no shrine without a head priestess, and so I have taken up that post.
Neko: Hibiki often took that stick and waved it back and forth before sunrise. She would also pour water on the ground. Ugh, water...
Neko: Hibiki often took that stick and waved it back and forth before the sun had risen. I used to enjoy chasing that stick, yes.
Neko: Hmph. That rascal always chopped off the same branches that I loved most. An infuriating fellow.
Neko: Ho, is that so? Those little rascals quite enjoy playing amongst the piles of fallen leaves.
Neko: I am going to rest. Perhaps your aid shall be required later also...
Neko: I had neither name nor title then. I slept where she wished, and played with whoever she willed.
Neko: I had neither name nor title then. I slept where she wished, and played with whomever she willed.
Neko: I remember that Hibiki would also use water on the ground... an ill thing to do, really.
Neko: Is that so? Human matters are so very bothersome.
Neko: Is your "cleanup" complete?
Neko: It was Hibiki. Domeki would help her sometimes, too.
Neko: It was she who often came out to receive guests at the shrine, and so I was not obligated to manage such affairs.
Neko: Meow! Yes, this work was given specifically to me by Hibiki. A vital task to be completed by no other.
Neko: Meow, meow. That is good. I have also chased those little crawlies away.
Neko: Meow, meow... We must return this shrine to its former glory, yes... Meow...
Neko: My name is Neko — a name bestowed by Hibiki.
Neko: Not long after your departure, two humans in green came to the shrine, meow, meow.
Neko: Not only did they offer up some Mora, but the tall, green human seemed most excited to hear me speak. How easily startled you humans are, really...
Neko: Nya, meow... That box has proven its worth indeed...
Neko: Once she returns, I can fall asleep in her bosom, and not have to wait for her to repair the Offering Box, or for her to use that long stick of hers to clear the fallen leaves.
Neko: One day, Hibiki said that she would call me "Neko," on account of my habit of sleeping.
Neko: Regardless, the Offering Box is a most wondrous artifact. Perhaps repairing another shall attract yet more people?
Neko: So that was "cleanup," then? I understand. In that case, would you go forth and do as such?
Neko: Speaking your language is... so tiring...
Neko: That is also why I hope to restore the shrine to its former liveliness before Hibiki returns.
Neko: The long stick, leaves, and water will do. Have you understood my words?
Neko: Wait. Did she pour the water first? I do not quite recall the sequence of events...
Neko: We shall stop here. Thank you for your help thus far... meow, meow...
Neko: Well, I shall leave those tasks to you. There are some sneaky bugs that have stolen into the shrine, and they must now be driven out.
Neko: What would I know about the intricacies of human deeds? Still... if it were Hibiki...
Neko: When that time comes, do return here to... meow, meow...
Neko: Why, this shrine is looking more and more the part. The box is repaired, and the shrine itself is clean... Yes, more people shall surely come to pay their respects.
Paimon: From the sound of it, they were doing cleanup. Guess you could call it re-organization as well.
Paimon: Neko probably means trimming the branches.
Paimon: P—Paimon thinks this has got way more to do with the state of the shrine...
Paimon: Sweeping the floor, washing it with water, and trimming the branches...
