Junkichi: Aha! Vegetables! Guess we shan't leave empty-handed!
Junkichi: I must say that your searching skills are like that of a... uh, a vigilant, professional ninja.

Junkichi: And failing that... Then defeating them is still an option!

Junkichi: Fortunately, the ninja's... uh, direct combat skills as also very good, and he defeats them all with ease!

Junkichi: Hey! That treasure chest is empty, too, really! Come on, please, can you just follow my outline!?

Junkichi: H—He prepares to leave... Hey, the ninja's leaving to report back. What are you planning to do?

Junkichi: I already said there's nothing inside. I haven't finished thinking yet... Well, nevermind. The ninja eventually decides to leave this room.

Junkichi: It's a fake tree! Or it's clearly a drum! ...Well, whatever. The ninja carefully searches around the drum...
Junkichi: There's nothing around the drum! But the ninja is still quite pleased. At least he now knows that there's... nothing beside the drum...

Junkichi: Oh no! The ninja seems to have activated a mechanism... An alarm... something! The enemy has discovered him!

Junkichi: Oh no, the ninja alerts the enemy, and they come in hot pursuit!
(If the player defeats the enemies)

Junkichi: Fortunately, the ninja's... uh, direct combat skills as also very good, and he defeats them all with ease!

Junkichi: Oh, come on... The ninja's actions have been discovered by the enemy, and large numbers of them surround him on every side. The ninja believes that it's time to go.
(If the player defeats the enemies)

Junkichi: What? Why do I have to write the ninja as being this good as fighting... The ninja defeated all the enemies...
Junkichi: The ninja gazes upon the foes he has defeated. It's *really* time to leave now...

Junkichi: On the other side of the window, the ninja finds yet another room next door. But he should focus on his missions...

Junkichi: The next room is full of treasure, but the ninja is unmoved. He is a true professional, and will certainly not deviate to perform some side quest.

Junkichi: The ninja checks that he has the box with the intelligence inside it in hand, and he prepares to leave.

Junkichi: The ninja defeats the enemy with his mastery of martial arts. Time to go get that intelligence...

Junkichi: The ninja feels that perhaps his surroundings might hide some unspeakable secret, and so he searches carefully...
Junkichi: But there really is nothing here...

Junkichi: The ninja, being very vigilant, scouts the area thoroughly before acting... and he finds nothing out of place.

Junkichi: Using his amazing agility, the ninja passes through this room without alerting anyone... What a brilliant move!

Junkichi: Wait, what are you doing here... Oh, I guess I can just write that the ninja checks his surroundings to be sure that it's safe...
Junkichi: Maybe the ninja can also look for a few other trinkets while he's at it.
Junkichi: What? I didn't write his character to be like that!

Junkichi: What? Why do I have to write the ninja as being this good as fighting... The ninja defeated all the enemies...
Junkichi: The ninja gazes upon the foes he has defeated. It's *really* time to leave now...
 Alright, cut it out.
 Am I supposed to read his novel right here and now?
 And how am I supposed to judge...
 Let's call a halt to this real quick, shall we?
 Let's just start...
 Quest DescriptionJunkichi seems to be struggling with his writing again...
 This creativity business sure is tiring...
 What are you two arguing about?
Junkichi: *sigh* Alright, alright... I've got no strength left to argue with you. Traveler, thanks for your... judgment.
Junkichi: ...So this is the structure I have in mind this time.
Junkichi: After infiltrating the fortress, the ninja prepares to initiate the operation. He is sure that the intelligence was hidden beside a fake tree within the fortress itself...
Junkichi: Aha! Vegetables! Guess we shan't leave empty-handed!
Junkichi: Alright, that's a wrap.
Junkichi: And failing that... Then defeating them is still an option!
Junkichi: But Shigeru's criticizing the structures that I came up with again...
Junkichi: But there really is nothing here...
Junkichi: Fortunately, the ninja's... uh, direct combat skills as also very good, and he defeats them all with ease!
Junkichi: Having made all the necessary preparations, the ninja infiltrates the fortress stealthily...
Junkichi: Hehe, Traveler, are you ready to play the stealthy ninja?
Junkichi: Hey! That treasure chest is empty, too, really! Come on, please, can you just follow my outline!?
Junkichi: Hmm, narrative devices or narrative... Which is more important?
Junkichi: Hmph, sure. Well, Traveler, we're counting on you.
Junkichi: H—He prepares to leave... Hey, the ninja's leaving to report back. What are you planning to do?
Junkichi: I already said there's nothing inside. I haven't finished thinking yet... Well, nevermind. The ninja eventually decides to leave this room.
Junkichi: I mean, it's fine! I mean, if you lock down all the narrative devices ahead of time, there's nowhere to adapt from there, right?
Junkichi: I must say that your searching skills are like that of a... uh, a vigilant, professional ninja.
Junkichi: I think I've gained a lot from this...
Junkichi: I'll narrate the story for you. Just act according to what you think is natural.
Junkichi: I'm sticking to my creative principles no matter what you say.
Junkichi: I've... never been this tired. Was this story always that complicated...
Junkichi: I...
Junkichi: It's a fake tree! Or it's clearly a drum! ...Well, whatever. The ninja carefully searches around the drum...
Junkichi: I—I have my own creative methods, alright? The story should put its narrative first. How can it be shackled by these devices?
Junkichi: I—I haven't finished thinking yet! ...Whatever the case, the ninja has the intel now!
Junkichi: Let's show Shigeru how awesome a story unbound by these... narrative devices can be!
Junkichi: Maybe the ninja can also look for a few other trinkets while he's at it.
Junkichi: No, no... I'm not going to list them all down and structure the narrative around them. That's just too staid!
Junkichi: Oh no! The ninja seems to have activated a mechanism... An alarm... something! The enemy has discovered him!
Junkichi: Oh no, the ninja alerts the enemy, and they come in hot pursuit!
Junkichi: Oh, come on... The ninja's actions have been discovered by the enemy, and large numbers of them surround him on every side. The ninja believes that it's time to go.
Junkichi: Oh, its you! I was just thinking about to structure a novel about a ninja.
Junkichi: On the other side of the window, the ninja finds yet another room next door. But he should focus on his missions...
Junkichi: So, as I was writing, this ninja is entering the enemy fortress solo, preparing to steal critical intelligence.
Junkichi: Take this as a token of my thanks. I'll get to writing again shortly.
Junkichi: The narrative is the most important thing in the novel, which everything else revolves around, even the setting and narrative devices...
Junkichi: The next room is full of treasure, but the ninja is unmoved. He is a true professional, and will certainly not deviate to perform some side quest.
Junkichi: The ninja checks that he has the box with the intelligence inside it in hand, and he prepares to leave.
Junkichi: The ninja defeats the enemy with his mastery of martial arts. Time to go get that intelligence...
Junkichi: The ninja discovers guards ahead. The broken wooden planks must've alerted the enemy. The ninja decides to find a way around them...
Junkichi: The ninja feels that perhaps his surroundings might hide some unspeakable secret, and so he searches carefully...
Junkichi: The ninja finds the intel successfully! Now he can return and make his report.
Junkichi: The ninja gazes upon the foes he has defeated. It's *really* time to leave now...
Junkichi: The ninja, being very vigilant, scouts the area thoroughly before acting... and he finds nothing out of place.
Junkichi: The supremely-skilled ninja uses all sorts of abilities to infiltrate the enemy fortress and retrieve the required intel in secret...
Junkichi: There's nothing around the drum! But the ninja is still quite pleased. At least he now knows that there's... nothing beside the drum...
Junkichi: This should be that fake tree, and the ninja searches carefully...
Junkichi: This should be where the intel is. The ninja decides to check the fake tree.
Junkichi: Th—That, uh, might depend on the situation?
Junkichi: Using his amazing agility, the ninja passes through this room without alerting anyone... What a brilliant move!
Junkichi: Wait, what are you doing here... Oh, I guess I can just write that the ninja checks his surroundings to be sure that it's safe...
Junkichi: Well, let's begin, Traveler.
Junkichi: What? I didn't write his character to be like that!
Junkichi: What? Why do I have to write the ninja as being this good as fighting... The ninja defeated all the enemies...
Junkichi: Yet another tightly locked room lies ahead, but the ninja adroitly discovers that perhaps the weak wooden flooring might serve as an entry point.
Shigeru: *sigh* ...You know what, Traveler? Since you're here, why don't you be the judge?
Shigeru: *sigh* And how many "abilities" are you going to give this ninja this time?
Shigeru: After that, just use your judgment and think about how his ninja would act.
Shigeru: Forget it, you're not going to listen to me anyway...
Shigeru: I'm not saying that what you've come up with is bad, per se. I'm just asking you to put your narrative devices in place first before you start writing...
Shigeru: If I might interrupt, what's the intel exactly? Why's it just a box?
Shigeru: Oh, here you go again. If you had these devices locked in beforehand, your writing wouldn't go all over the shop!
Shigeru: Right. So you haven't thought about it, then.
Shigeru: That way, Junkichi should get the feedback he needs about what happens when he just writes his story willy-nilly.
Shigeru: That's just irresponsible, you...
Shigeru: That's what you get when you don't decide on things early. Without narrative devices to restrain you, the various elements just clash wildly against each other.
Shigeru: Uh, no, you just need to listen to Junkichi tell us the structure of this new narrative passage he's dreamed up.
Shigeru: When that happens, you'll end up losing control over the plot altogether. You'd exhaust yourself no matter what you were writing.
Shigeru: You...
