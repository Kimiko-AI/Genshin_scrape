 Quest DescriptionYou must first break the five seals on Watatsumi Island if you wish to enter Enkanomiya.
 Step DescriptionAn ancient stone tablet stands beside the shrine. Will there be anything of use written on it?
 Step DescriptionWith the help of the stone tablet's instructions, perhaps breaking the shrine seal will not be a problem... Right?
 Step DescriptionYou have finally broken the shrine's seal, and the Spirit Pearl is yours to claim. Go forth and take it!
Ancient Stone Tablet: "...From the depths it arose, from the south, o'er the north, and all about the western mound..."
Ancient Stone Tablet: "...The tree eyes shone mercilessly to ward off the dragon's heir..."
Ancient Stone Tablet: "...They say that Omikami's envoy had three eyes: one for the 'soul', one a 'mirror', and the last the 'truth'..."
Paimon: All the seals have been removed. Let's see if anything changed at the shrine!
Paimon: And that's a third! We're getting close!
Paimon: Fourth Spirit Pearl obtained! Let's go find Tsuyuko!
Paimon: It doesnt look like there are any clues around here either, so why don't we try using Elemental Sight?
Paimon: Oh no, the elemental energy from the broken seal has attracted slimes!
Paimon: Paimon... knows all these words... but none of them mean anything when strung together.
Paimon: There's another Spirit Pearl!
Paimon: This must be the "Eye" that Tsuyuko was talking about!
Paimon: We found a pearl. Is this the Spirit Pearl Tsuyuko talked about?
Paimon: We've broken one seal!
Paimon: Where did these Specters come from? Were they attracted here by the sealed elemental power?
