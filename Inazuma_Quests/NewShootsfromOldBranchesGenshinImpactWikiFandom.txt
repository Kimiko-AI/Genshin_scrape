(A short cutscene plays)
Media:vo lrlq001 cs thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Without looking at the board, you've ruined my strategy in one move. Amazing
Media:vo lrlq001 cs thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Hmm... Now what should I do next...
Media:vo lrlq001 cs paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ayaka, Thoma, it's us!
Media:vo lrlq001 cs thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Hey guys! It's been a while
Media:vo lrlq001 cs thoma 04.ogg Thoma: If you're looking for milady, I'm afraid... she's not here right now
Kamisato Ayato: Oh?
Media:vo lrlq001 cs ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: That voice... Thoma, would that happen to be the Traveler?
Media:vo lrlq001 cs thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Yes
Media:vo lrlq001 cs ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Greetings, Traveler. Ayaka speaks of you constantly. Finally, today is the day
Media:vo lrlq001 cs ayato 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I am head of the Kamisato Clan, and Yashiro Commissioner — Kamisato Ayato

Media:vo lrlq001 15 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Oh? So you know the owner as well?

Media:vo lrlq001 16 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I meant to ask earlier — do you know the owner here as well?
 (Actually, you don't get what he means at all...)
 (Good luck, Thoma)
 (Sorry, Thoma.)
 ...He finally went there.
 ...I'm bothered by how the whole thing began.
 ...Let's go with Dango.
Media:vo lrlq001 21 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yes! Dango! Dango will do nicely!
Media:vo lrlq001 21 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Hmm. An ordinary choice, but there's nothing wrong with that.
Media:vo lrlq001 21 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Two Dango Milks, and one Milk with Lavender Melon, please.
Media:vo lrlq001 21 tomoki 01.ogg Tomoki: No problem. Gimme a second, I'll have them ready in just a moment.
 A reasonable theory. But it's just a theory.
 Are there really no negative consequences to this?
 As it happens, we've crossed paths with them before.
 Been here before?
 But still. Let's go see them.
 But...
 Good memory.
 He seems genuinely happy, but...
 Hmm, I guess it is a bit strange...
 How have you been?
 How so?
 I guess she's just pretty shy?
 I think he can't help it.
 I'm a little busy right now...
 In other words, you have too many other things to worry about?
 It was a twist of fate.
 It was unexpected, that's for sure.
 Lavender Melon.
Media:vo lrlq001 18 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Sounds like a risky choice. Are you sure...? Well, okay, Paimon will have the same as you...
Media:vo lrlq001 18 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Three Milks with Lavender Melon, please.
Media:vo lrlq001 18 tomoki 01.ogg Tomoki: No problem. Gimme a second, I'll have them ready in just a moment.
 Maybe she prefers things to be more implicit?
 Nothing can stop him from sharing his love story...
 Oh... so she proposed to you?
 Paimon goes from polite to presumptuous in a split-second.
 Paimon, don't overestimate your contribution here.
 Quest DescriptionAs you and Paimon pass by Ogura Textiles & Kimonos, you bump into two rather familiar people...
 Remind me who they are again?
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: What? You forgot already?
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 03b 1.ogg Paimon: That one is Shinnojou. Back when we first arrived in Inazuma, we escorted Hiiragi Chisato out of Ritou with him. Remember? That's how we got out.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 03b 2.ogg Paimon: Next to him is Ippei, Kujou Kamaji's servant. That day when we hung out with Ei, he came and told us that Kujou Kamaji had gone missing. He was really worried.
 Good memory.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 03b 3.ogg Paimon: Hehe, all part of Paimon's job as your guide.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 03b 4.ogg Paimon: Anyway, let's go say hi.
 Romantic relationships are determined by fate.
 Sea Ganoderma.
Media:vo lrlq001 20 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: ...
Media:vo lrlq001 20 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Doesn't Paimon get a say in this? So this is peer pressure, huh? Well... Alright, then bring it on! Paimon can take it!
Media:vo lrlq001 20 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Three Milks with Sea Ganoderma, please.
Media:vo lrlq001 20 tomoki 01.ogg Tomoki: No problem. Gimme a second, I'll have them ready in just a moment.
 Seagrass.
Media:vo lrlq001 19 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Are you serious? Uh... will Paimon seem like a scaredy-cat if she opts out of this one? Ugh, okay, Paimon'll have one, too...
Media:vo lrlq001 19 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Three Milks with Seagrass, please.
Media:vo lrlq001 19 tomoki 01.ogg Tomoki: No problem. Gimme a second, I'll have them ready in just a moment.
 So adaptable, Paimon.
 So it is!
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 03a.ogg Paimon: Hehe, guess they must be good friends, huh?
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 03a 1.ogg Paimon: Anyway, let's go say hi.
 So... is someone coveting Hiiragi Chisato's position?
 So... is someone trying to get Hiiragi Chisato into trouble?
 Sounds like it was worth sending that letter.
 Speaking from experience?
 Step DescriptionIt seems that this marriage between the two Commissions is a real thing. Ayato invites you and Paimon to go with him to send well-wishes...
 Step DescriptionYou hear from Ippei and Shinnojou that Kujou Kamaji and Hiiragi Chisato may be married soon. To help Shinnojou confirm this, you head to the Kamisato Estate.
 The Yashiro Commission oversees wedding ceremonies. They'll know something.
 Unfortunately, there's no evidence.
 We can't let this evil plan come to fruition.
 We've got to stop her.
 Well, since this is a wedding between two Commissions...
 You mean us?
 You must be a smooth operator.
 You overheard those guys talking about something?
 You saw who Hiiragi Chisato was meeting?
 You seem down.
 You seem upset.
After a short while, the "Creative Milk" is finally ready.
Kamisato Ayato: Oh?
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 hiiragichisato 01.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: What should I do...
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 hiiragichisato 02.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: Oh, Kamaji...
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 hishida 01.ogg Hishida: My family can take charge of that. We have a lot of written correspondence with them already.
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 ippei 01.ogg Ippei: Not to pry, but it seems like there's something on your mind. Do you want to talk about it?
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 kujoukamaji 01.ogg Kujou Kamaji: I know it's not an easy path ahead, but this is my responsibility.
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 kujoukamaji 02.ogg Kujou Kamaji: I need to give her a reason to be confident in me.
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 matsuura 01.ogg Matsuura: Now, where were we again? Ah yes, invitations...
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 matsuura 02.ogg Matsuura: Sounds sensible to me. Then, thank you.
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 shinnojou 01.ogg Shinnojou: It's nothing. I just didn't sleep well, that's all. Really, I'm fine.
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: What's wrong? Are you worried about having to be on your best behavior around my lord? Hahaha, don't be nervous. He's actually pretty easy to get along with.
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Well... the vast majority of the time, at least...
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 tomoki 01.ogg Tomoki: Ah, it's you two! Seems like you're always showing up with a VIP in tow.
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 tomoki 02.ogg Tomoki: I got my license and I'm doing a soft opening today. Wanna try out my latest creative drink?
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 tomoki 03.ogg Tomoki: Okay sure. Well, feel free to swing by later if you're free.
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 tomoki 04.ogg Tomoki: Thanks for coming. Hope to see you again!
Media:vo dialog lrlq001 tomoki 05.ogg Tomoki: Maybe this whole "creativity" theme really will work out...
Media:vo lrlq001 1 ippei 01.ogg Ippei: Oh! It's you! Thanks so much for your help last time.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 ippei 02.ogg Ippei: I was just ordering some clothes when I ran into him.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 ippei 03a.ogg Media:vo lrlq001 1 ippei 03b.ogg Ippei: Yes. They helped me and Master Kamaji out a great deal last time. I've never had the chance to say thank you properly.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 ippei 04.ogg Ippei: What about you? How do you know them?
Media:vo lrlq001 1 ippei 05.ogg Ippei: Ah, not exactly. We've only just met. We both came here to order some clothes and got to chatting.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 ippei 06.ogg Ippei: Somehow we ended up on the topic of Master Kamaji and Lady Hiiragi's relationship... Wait... it's okay to talk about that, right?
Media:vo lrlq001 1 ippei 07.ogg Ippei: We have reason to suspect that they'll be getting married soon.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 ippei 08.ogg Ippei: Of course, this is just personal speculation. They haven't announced anything, and we wouldn't dare to ask...
Media:vo lrlq001 1 ippei 09.ogg Ippei: They're both preparing for a banquet at the same time, they're both purchasing the kind of fine wine and confectionery normally reserved for big festivals... It's hard not to put two and two together.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 ippei 10.ogg Ippei: Right? I think so, too, it's fantastic!
Media:vo lrlq001 1 ippei 11.ogg Ippei: Are you worried about their wedding?
Media:vo lrlq001 1 ippei 12.ogg Ippei: I get what you mean, I really do! We need this wedding to be set in stone before the celebrations can really begin!
Media:vo lrlq001 1 ippei 13.ogg Ippei: I don't know, that seems a bit rude...
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm? Those two look familiar...
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ah, it's Ippei and Shinnojou!
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 03a 1.ogg Paimon: Anyway, let's go say hi.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 03a.ogg Paimon: Hehe, guess they must be good friends, huh?
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 03b 1.ogg Paimon: That one is Shinnojou. Back when we first arrived in Inazuma, we escorted Hiiragi Chisato out of Ritou with him. Remember? That's how we got out.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 03b 2.ogg Paimon: Next to him is Ippei, Kujou Kamaji's servant. That day when we hung out with Ei, he came and told us that Kujou Kamaji had gone missing. He was really worried.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 03b 3.ogg Paimon: Hehe, all part of Paimon's job as your guide.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 03b 4.ogg Paimon: Anyway, let's go say hi.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: What? You forgot already?
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hi, Ippei! Hi, Shinnojou! What are you guys doing here?
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So we all know each other, huh! What a coincidence!
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Oh yeah! Paimon remembers those two had a thing. In fact, that was why Chisato wanted us to deliver a letter!
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: That's old news though, so why's it come up now? Are they... taking the next step, or something?
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Wow! That's great! They can finally make it official!
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: This is wonderful news! But, um...
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Shinnojou doesn't look like he's taking this very well at all.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: What should we do? Shall we just... straight up ask them?
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Right! If Ayaka knows about it, that means it's a sure thing!
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 13a.ogg Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 13b.ogg Paimon: Ah, it's fine. (Traveler) and Ayaka are practically best buds. There's nothing to worry about!
Media:vo lrlq001 1 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Let's go to the Kamisato Estate!
Media:vo lrlq001 1 shinnojou 01.ogg Shinnojou: You know these two as well?
Media:vo lrlq001 1 shinnojou 02a.ogg Media:vo lrlq001 1 shinnojou 02b.ogg Shinnojou: Also a chance encounter. Our Lady had them join us as additional guards for a goods escort in order to sneak out of Ritou undetected.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 shinnojou 03.ogg Shinnojou: It's probably fine. They've known about it for a long time already.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 shinnojou 04.ogg Shinnojou: I was instructed to place an order for some formal wear for a big banquet. Turns out that Ippei received the exact same instructions as I did.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 shinnojou 05.ogg Shinnojou: Lady Hiiragi has been in high spirits recently, and I heard she's on a diet as well... Surely it's all for the wedding.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 shinnojou 06.ogg Shinnojou: What's wrong?
Media:vo lrlq001 1 shinnojou 07.ogg Shinnojou: Oh, don't mind me. She's about to be happily married to the love of her life. I genuinely couldn't be happier for her.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 shinnojou 08.ogg Shinnojou: Yes, but we shouldn't let ourselves get overexcited. What if it's all a big misunderstanding? As things stand, we have no actual proof of a wedding.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 shinnojou 09.ogg Shinnojou: Now, if they sent me out to deliver wedding invitations, that would be a different story...
Media:vo lrlq001 1 shinnojou 10.ogg Shinnojou: ...Sorry. I just... haven't slept well recently.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 shinnojou 11.ogg Shinnojou: I'm ashamed to be so out of sorts at work. I'm not living up to my responsibilities, either to the Kanjou Commission or to my lady...
Media:vo lrlq001 1 shinnojou 12.ogg Shinnojou: Not exactly, it's just... everything feels kind of up in the air until they make it official.
Media:vo lrlq001 1 shinnojou 13.ogg Shinnojou: I... I don't think it's a good idea to bother the Yashiro Commission about this...
Media:vo lrlq001 1 shinnojou 14.ogg Shinnojou: I see... Then, thank you, thank you very much. Having a definite answer will stop my thoughts from running wild.
Media:vo lrlq001 10 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: As it happens, I'm here regarding the same wedding I believe I heard you discussing just now. I come bearing the felicitations of the Kamisato Clan.
Media:vo lrlq001 10 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Would Lady Hiiragi happen to be available at this moment?
Media:vo lrlq001 10 ayato 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: You misunderstand. These two are dear friends.
Media:vo lrlq001 10 ayato 04.ogg Kamisato Ayato: We don't wish to impose. We'll just wander around in the general area.
Media:vo lrlq001 10 ayato 05.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Apologies for the interruption while you're busy with preparations. Please let us know once Lady Hiiragi is available.
Media:vo lrlq001 10 ayato 06.ogg Kamisato Ayato: That sounds splendid.
Media:vo lrlq001 10 ayato 07.ogg Kamisato Ayato: We'll leave you to it.
Media:vo lrlq001 10 hishida 01.ogg Hishida: At the very least we should send them invitations.
Media:vo lrlq001 10 hishida 02.ogg Hishida: But please, do come in. We will arrange some tea and snacks for you and your attendants.
Media:vo lrlq001 10 hishida 03.ogg Hishida: When the time comes, we'll invite everyone in the clan and even the general public to attend.
Media:vo lrlq001 10 matsuura 01.ogg Matsuura: There is still much to prepare for the wedding.
Media:vo lrlq001 10 matsuura 02.ogg Matsuura: Should we also invite some prominent business leaders who frequently visit Ritou?
Media:vo lrlq001 10 matsuura 03.ogg Matsuura: I agree... Ah, hello there, Yashiro Commissioner.
Media:vo lrlq001 10 matsuura 04.ogg Matsuura: Our lady is entertaining guests right now, and we're not entirely sure how long she will be.
Media:vo lrlq001 10 matsuura 05.ogg Matsuura: Nonsense, Commissioner, no imposition at all. This wedding is a joyful occasion, and all the other clans who serve the Hiiragi Clan are most delighted for them indeed.
Media:vo lrlq001 10 matsuura 06.ogg Matsuura: We're merely doing the best we can to make this wedding as grand an affair as possible.
Media:vo lrlq001 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey! Paimon is not an attendant!
Media:vo lrlq001 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hehehe, you're too kind...
Media:vo lrlq001 10 yagi 01.ogg Yagi: To what do we owe the honor on this fine day?
Media:vo lrlq001 10 yagi 02.ogg Yagi: Take care, Commissioner.
Media:vo lrlq001 12 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Hence why I dislike small talk.
Media:vo lrlq001 12 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Our timing was not ideal, but never mind. I spotted a stall on our way over where we can pass the time.
Media:vo lrlq001 12 ayato 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: The owner always manages to come up with novel ideas. I'm one of his regular customers.
Media:vo lrlq001 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Seems like you guys talked a lot without actually saying anything...
Media:vo lrlq001 15 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Oh? So you know the owner as well?
Media:vo lrlq001 15 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh, it's Tomoki!
Media:vo lrlq001 15 tomoki 01.ogg Tomoki: Ah, it's you! Good to see you again.
Media:vo lrlq001 15 tomoki 02.ogg Tomoki: Seems like you're always showing up with a VIP in tow.
Media:vo lrlq001 16 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I meant to ask earlier — do you know the owner here as well?
Media:vo lrlq001 17 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Ah, I see... So you were involved in that...
Media:vo lrlq001 17 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I'd caught wind of this Dango Milk, but I didn't know that it had anything to do with you two.
Media:vo lrlq001 17 ayato 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I always order one of his creative drinks whenever I pass the stall. The flavor is always new and interesting.
Media:vo lrlq001 17 ayato 04.ogg Kamisato Ayato: When I noticed he'd set up shop in Ritou, I simply had to come by.
Media:vo lrlq001 17 ayato 05.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Sounds interesting. What is it this time?
Media:vo lrlq001 17 ayato 06.ogg Kamisato Ayato: What if I were to choose some ingredients you don't have here? Would that be okay?
Media:vo lrlq001 17 ayato 07.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Excellent. There are a few things I'd like to try...
Media:vo lrlq001 17 ayato 08.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Lavender Melon, Seagrass, and Sea Ganoderma.
Media:vo lrlq001 17 ayato 09.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I do indeed — why, what's wrong?
Media:vo lrlq001 17 ayato 10.ogg Kamisato Ayato: It's all about the experience — the taste is secondary. It's great to try new things.
Media:vo lrlq001 17 ayato 11.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Traveler? Any thoughts?
Media:vo lrlq001 17 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yep! We tried his Dango Milk a while back with the Almighty Shogun in Inazuma City.
Media:vo lrlq001 17 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Do they really all go well with milk...?
Media:vo lrlq001 17 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm, hard to imagine. But... who knows — it could be delicious!
Media:vo lrlq001 17 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Uh, what? You want to mix those with milk?
Media:vo lrlq001 17 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: ...You really think that's gonna turn out tasting good!?
Media:vo lrlq001 17 tomoki 01.ogg Tomoki: Ah, thanks to you all, my business is finally beginning to take off. More and more people are willing to give my creative cuisine a shot.
Media:vo lrlq001 17 tomoki 02.ogg Tomoki: It gave me the confidence to decide that I'm gonna stick to creative cuisine from now on.
Media:vo lrlq001 17 tomoki 03.ogg Tomoki: On the one hand, I wanted more people to be able to try out my culinary creations. On the other hand, I wanted my customers to experience the joy of being creative, too.
Media:vo lrlq001 17 tomoki 04.ogg Tomoki: So, I gave it a lot of thought, and finally came up with an all-new business concept.
Media:vo lrlq001 17 tomoki 05.ogg Tomoki: I've decided to give complete creative control to the customer. I offer all sorts of ingredients, and they pick and choose whatever they want to mix with their milk or tea.
Media:vo lrlq001 17 tomoki 06.ogg Tomoki: As well as Dango, I now offer Rice Cake, Purple Potato Balls, Black Sugar, and Sunsettia.
Media:vo lrlq001 17 tomoki 07.ogg Tomoki: Uhh, well... I guess so. Any novel ideas you have, Commissioner, please feel free to tell me. I'll go buy the ingredients right away.
Media:vo lrlq001 17 tomoki 08.ogg Tomoki: The whole idea was to let my customers express their creativity freely. So of course, I shouldn't place restrictions on the ingredients if I can help it.
Media:vo lrlq001 18 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Three Milks with Lavender Melon, please.
Media:vo lrlq001 18 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I think it tastes alright. It makes me feel in touch with mother nature.
Media:vo lrlq001 18 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Sounds like a risky choice. Are you sure...? Well, okay, Paimon will have the same as you...
Media:vo lrlq001 18 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmm...
Media:vo lrlq001 18 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yup, just as Paimon suspected. Raw Lavender Melon does not taste good!
Media:vo lrlq001 18 tomoki 01.ogg Tomoki: No problem. Gimme a second, I'll have them ready in just a moment.
Media:vo lrlq001 18 tomoki 02.ogg Tomoki: Here, your milk is ready. Give it a try!
Media:vo lrlq001 18 tomoki 02.ogg Tomoki: Here, your milk is ready. Give it a try!
Media:vo lrlq001 18 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmm...
Media:vo lrlq001 18 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yup, just as Paimon suspected. Raw Lavender Melon does not taste good!
Media:vo lrlq001 18 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I think it tastes alright. It makes me feel in touch with mother nature.
Media:vo lrlq001 19 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Three Milks with Seagrass, please.
Media:vo lrlq001 19 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: But it tastes alright. It captures the essence of the ocean.
Media:vo lrlq001 19 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Are you serious? Uh... will Paimon seem like a scaredy-cat if she opts out of this one? Ugh, okay, Paimon'll have one, too...
Media:vo lrlq001 19 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmm...
Media:vo lrlq001 19 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: The Seagrass is stuck in the straw... Phew, this is so much work...
Media:vo lrlq001 19 tomoki 01.ogg Tomoki: No problem. Gimme a second, I'll have them ready in just a moment.
Media:vo lrlq001 19 tomoki 02.ogg Tomoki: Here, your milk is ready. Give it a try!
Media:vo lrlq001 19 tomoki 02.ogg Tomoki: Here, your milk is ready. Give it a try!
Media:vo lrlq001 19 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmm...
Media:vo lrlq001 19 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: The Seagrass is stuck in the straw... Phew, this is so much work...
Media:vo lrlq001 19 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: But it tastes alright. It captures the essence of the ocean.
Media:vo lrlq001 2 ippei 01.ogg Ippei: This place impresses me every time I come here. It's so magnificent but still so elegant.
Media:vo lrlq001 2 ippei 02.ogg Ippei: Honestly, even if we did come with you, we wouldn't know what to say or do once we were inside... Hehe, so we'll just leave you to it.
Media:vo lrlq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ayaka wouldn't mind!
Media:vo lrlq001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Alright then. We won't be long.
Media:vo lrlq001 2 shinnojou 01.ogg Shinnojou: We'll just wait here. We don't want to cause any extra trouble for you.
Media:vo lrlq001 20 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Three Milks with Sea Ganoderma, please.
Media:vo lrlq001 20 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I think it's alright. It has quite a fascinating texture.
Media:vo lrlq001 20 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: ...
Media:vo lrlq001 20 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Doesn't Paimon get a say in this? So this is peer pressure, huh? Well... Alright, then bring it on! Paimon can take it!
Media:vo lrlq001 20 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm...
Media:vo lrlq001 20 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Somehow, Paimon got it down eventually, but... ugh, Paimon feels light-headed...
Media:vo lrlq001 20 tomoki 01.ogg Tomoki: No problem. Gimme a second, I'll have them ready in just a moment.
Media:vo lrlq001 20 tomoki 02.ogg Tomoki: Here, your milk is ready. Give it a try!
Media:vo lrlq001 20 tomoki 02.ogg Tomoki: Here, your milk is ready. Give it a try!
Media:vo lrlq001 20 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm...
Media:vo lrlq001 20 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Somehow, Paimon got it down eventually, but... ugh, Paimon feels light-headed...
Media:vo lrlq001 20 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I think it's alright. It has quite a fascinating texture.
Media:vo lrlq001 21 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Hmm. An ordinary choice, but there's nothing wrong with that.
Media:vo lrlq001 21 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Two Dango Milks, and one Milk with Lavender Melon, please.
Media:vo lrlq001 21 ayato 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: A most memorable texture indeed. A success, I'd say.
Media:vo lrlq001 21 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yes! Dango! Dango will do nicely!
Media:vo lrlq001 21 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Dango Milk tastes pretty good once you get used to it.
Media:vo lrlq001 21 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What about yours?
Media:vo lrlq001 21 tomoki 01.ogg Tomoki: No problem. Gimme a second, I'll have them ready in just a moment.
Media:vo lrlq001 21 tomoki 02.ogg Tomoki: Here, your milk is ready. Give it a try!
Media:vo lrlq001 21 tomoki 02.ogg Tomoki: Here, your milk is ready. Give it a try!
Media:vo lrlq001 21 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Dango Milk tastes pretty good once you get used to it.
Media:vo lrlq001 21 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What about yours?
Media:vo lrlq001 21 ayato 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: A most memorable texture indeed. A success, I'd say.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Taste is your key concern, yes?
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Well said. If I could say the same was true for me, I believe I'd be a very content man.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Yes. No one has unlimited energy, and I try to conserve mine for the things that really count. To create some mental breathing room, I try not to overthink the less-critical matters.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 04.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Having my sister attend public events in my stead and having Thoma as housekeeper has also been a great help, and allowed me to focus.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 05.ogg Kamisato Ayato: One or two things.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 06.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Let's continue this discussion somewhere else.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 07.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I noticed something before we left the Hiiragi Clan's residence.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 08.ogg Kamisato Ayato: No, it was just a small detail. I was curious to know their thoughts on the wedding, so I asked them about it.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 09.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Naturally, they responded that all other clans are happy for the Hiiragi Clan...
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 10.ogg Kamisato Ayato: But that's not the truth.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 11.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Hiiragi Shinsuke is still in prison, meaning the Kanjou Commission is the least stable in the Tri-Commission.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 12.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Hiiragi Chisato is the sole remaining pillar of her clan, but now she plans to marry into the Kujou Clan. If I belonged to one of the assisting clans to the Hiiragis, I would not be feeling optimistic about the future.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 13.ogg Kamisato Ayato: But they didn't mention a word about that, they simply said they were delighted for them. These are not unintelligent people... I highly doubt it is because they simply do not realize.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 14.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I imagine they didn't want to discuss family issues in front of outsiders. But still, the more I think back over that conversation, the more it doesn't sit right.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 15.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Keep a close eye on them, Hisashi.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 16.ogg Kamisato Ayato: This is one of my most trusted members of the Shuumatsuban. He's been quietly watching out for us this whole time.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 17.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Keep a close watch on the clan representatives we met today.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 18.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Oh, and I almost forgot. That milk I just had — please order one more and deliver it to Thoma.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 19.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Thank you kindly.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 ayato 20.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Let's go and see Hiiragi Chisato.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 hisashi 01.ogg Hisashi: Yes, Sir.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 hisashi 02.ogg Hisashi: Merely doing my duty, Sir.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 hisashi 03.ogg Hisashi: Well received. I'm on the case.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 hisashi 04.ogg Hisashi: As you wish, Sir.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Your review seemed pretty positive. But Paimon still thinks there are better combinations...
Media:vo lrlq001 22 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Obviously! Tasty food and drinks are some of life's most important pursuits.
Media:vo lrlq001 22 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We're just passing the time here though, right? Is there anything else to think about than what we're doing right now?
Media:vo lrlq001 22 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: What do you mean?
Media:vo lrlq001 22 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Whoa! Where did you come from!?
Media:vo lrlq001 22 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Oh no, poor Thoma!
Media:vo lrlq001 22 yokoyama 01.ogg Yokoyama: Sir Kamisato, Lady Hiiragi's previous engagement is now concluded. She's waiting for you in the courtyard.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: It's been a while, Lady Hiiragi. How have you been faring?
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: But of course. The Tri-Commission are the servants of the Shogun, and we should look out for one another. In fact, we visited Sir Kujou just now. It's clear that he's very much looking forward to the wedding.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Perhaps his joy is infectious, for I am now feeling rather elated myself. I sincerely wish you a joyful wedding and a blissful marriage.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 04.ogg Kamisato Ayato: It sounds like you have some considerable reservations, Lady Hiiragi.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 05.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Traditionally, in Inazuma, clan affiliation influences every facet of life.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 06.ogg Kamisato Ayato: After the wedding, Lady Hiiragi will belong to the Kujou Clan. The Kanjou Commission's attitude toward you may undergo some significant changes thereafter.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 07.ogg Kamisato Ayato: No problem at all. The Yashiro Commission has a duty to listen to you. Now that I've heard your concerns, I should offer to help you as best I can, for instance, by helping you gather your thoughts on the matter.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 08.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Now. We heard from Sir Kujou that his decision to tie the knot was prompted by a letter he received from you.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 09.ogg Kamisato Ayato: But we've also heard that you did not write that letter. Sir Kujou thought that perhaps you were just being coy... Oh dear, perhaps I should have kept that part to myself?
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 10.ogg Kamisato Ayato: ...Fancy lettering, you say?
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 11.ogg Kamisato Ayato: So I am to understand that had it not been for this letter, you two may not have chosen this moment to be wed?
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 12.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Sir Kujou maintains that the letter was penned by your hand.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 13.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Either way, it's wonderful to see how much you both trust one another. In that sense, you could say that the origin of the letter is ultimately not of great importance.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 14.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Who knows, perhaps Sir Kujou was the one being coy. After all, he had no particular reason to be forthcoming with us about the details of his playful proposal.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 15.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Marriage is the most important decision of your life. Don't let yourself regret it.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 16.ogg Kamisato Ayato: It is also part of the Yashiro Commission's job to help people through difficult times.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 17.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I say this as an advocate for you personally and for the Hiiragi Clan. Please do not be compelled by circumstances to make any decision that goes against your will.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 18.ogg Kamisato Ayato: To be together with the one you love is a sacred thing. It is my earnest wish that both of you may enjoy a bright and beautiful future, not a bittersweet one.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 19.ogg Kamisato Ayato: All that matters is that you follow your heart. Since you'll be needing some time to think things over, we will excuse ourselves now.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 20.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Thank you, Lady Hiiragi, but there will be no need.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 ayato 21.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Traveler, let's find somewhere to talk.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 01.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: I heard that Sir Kamisato had brought some guests, but I didn't know it was you two.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 02.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: This is a rare privilege, Sir Kamisato. It is not often that I have the chance to meet you, let alone here in the comfort of my own home. I'm doing very well indeed, thank you.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 03.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: You must be so busy. Thank you so much for taking the time to come and congratulate Kamaji and I, it really means a lot.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 04.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: Thank you for your kind words.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 05.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: This was not an easy decision to make. We will both have to work harder from now on.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 06.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: I'm sure the news will cause something of a stir. But come what may, we will stand as one and face whatever the future throws at us together.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 07.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: Yes... To be honest, I'm still a little nervous about it all...
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 08.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: But Kamaji has been so supportive. His promises have comforted me a lot.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 09.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: ...Yes, well... There are so many things I need to consider.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 10.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: In case you were wondering, I was not actually entertaining VIPs just now. I was in fact meeting with one of the Kanjou Commission's officers, Shinnojou.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 11.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: Mm-hmm. He charged in all of a sudden and said that he had something very important to tell me.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 12.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: He didn't mince his words. Basically... he doesn't want me to marry Kamaji.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 13.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: He has always been a calm and contained person who never acts out of line. I was quite shocked to see him so agitated.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 14.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: But despite all that, what he was saying made a lot of sense. He thinks that now is a bad time for this wedding to happen.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 15.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: He pointed out that I am like the final pillar propping up my clan. If I marry into the Kujou Clan, that pillar is taken away. There will no longer be a voice of authority in the Hiiragi Clan, and it could be a disastrous move for my personal image, too...
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 16.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: Precisely. This is a terrible thing to be saying, but... I'm starting to have second thoughts. Maybe I went along with it all too easily. Maybe I allowed myself to be pushed into this...
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 17.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: Ah! I'm so sorry, I can't believe I'm making my guests listen to me complaining...
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 18.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: ...What? But that was... It was just a prop in his playful proposal, wasn't it? It was clearly purpose-designed, what with all the fancy lettering, and so on...
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 19.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: When it comes down to it... Yes, I think so... Oh, do you mean to say that this letter is not what I thought it to be?
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 20.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: Huh? But then... how did...
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 21.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: ...
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 22.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: I understand. As you say, ultimately, the origin of the letter doesn't matter.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 23.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: But my position does matter. Kamaji and I thought that we needn't worry about anything that lies ahead, because we can face it all together.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 24.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: But now, I... I think I should give it some more thought.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 25.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: I'll take to heart every word you have said to me... I can't thank you enough, Sir Kamisato. I'll think very carefully about your advice.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 hiiragichisato 26.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: Ah, wait! Let me see you out...
Media:vo lrlq001 24 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hi! Nice to see you again, Chisato!
Media:vo lrlq001 24 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Sounds like things are pretty tough for you, Chisato.
Media:vo lrlq001 24 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh... really? Him?
Media:vo lrlq001 24 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: It's just two families becoming one big family though, right? What's the big deal?
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I've said everything I can, given the Yashiro Commission's stance. Interfering too much with other Commissions' domestic issues will only create trouble.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: The more I think about it, the stranger this all seems, but Hiiragi Chisato has yet to see it. We must be vigilant.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Someone wants Hiiragi Chisato to be married as soon as possible, and if my guess is right... it is someone from within the Kanjou Commission. This person is presumably also responsible for the mysterious and misleading letter.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 04.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Think about this: A lowly officer is greatly worried about Hiiragi Chisato's future, while the heads of the supporting clans ostensibly have no concerns at all. It doesn't add up.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 05.ogg Kamisato Ayato: When someone's words and actions do not match, you need to infer their intentions from their behavior.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 06.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Yes. It's a smart strategy. Far superior to the one adopted by the Tenryou Commission's Takatsukasa Clan.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 07.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Even had the forged letter failed and been seen for what it was, there would have been no repercussions. They could simply have explained it away as a misguided but well-meaning matchmaking attempt by a member of the family.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 08.ogg Kamisato Ayato: But if the letter were to achieve its goal, as it has so far... the perpetrator would successfully weaken the Hiiragi Clan without ever having to lift a finger against them, all under the guise of simply encouraging a wedding.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 09.ogg Kamisato Ayato: With Hiiragi Chisato having married into the Kujou Clan and the head of the Hiiragi Clan in prison, challenges to the Hiiragi Clan's leadership would begin to emerge throughout the ranks of the Kanjou Commission... Eventually, another clan would take the Hiiragi Clan's place.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 10.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Actually, we have evidence. His name is Shinnojou.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 11.ogg Kamisato Ayato: He should be back by now.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 12.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Did they take one of the Kanjou Commission officers away?
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 13.ogg Kamisato Ayato: As I expected.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 14.ogg Kamisato Ayato: They cannot afford to let this opportunity pass them by. They have to act now, while the Hiiragi Clan is at its weakest.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 15.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Hiiragi Chisato had been persuaded by Kujou Kamaji, and the wedding was sure to go ahead.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 16.ogg Kamisato Ayato: But after Chisato's meeting with Shinnojou, she began to have second thoughts. In their eyes, Officer Shinnojou has interfered with their plan.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 17.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Someone was eavesdropping on our conversation with Chisato the entire time. That's why I was a little reserved.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 18.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I think so. But whoever is behind this will not allow their plan to fail now. They will not be inclined to respect Hiiragi Chisato's own wishes.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 19.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Her stance was so passive that she was easily manipulated... Treated like a pawn, with even her marriage becoming a battleground for political power play.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 20.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Despite all of this, she still believed that a happy future was awaiting her...
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 21.ogg Kamisato Ayato: When she formally marries into the Kujou Clan, she will lose her title as daughter of the Hiiragi Clan, her position in the Kanjou Commission... and above all, her independence.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 22.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Easier said than done... The perpetrators are manipulating everything from the shadows, letting unsuspecting pawns do their work. This is what makes their approach so smart.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 23.ogg Kamisato Ayato: We, meanwhile, are out in the open. If we attempt to stop this wedding from happening, we will become the villains of the story and face immense public backlash.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 24.ogg Kamisato Ayato: At this stage, if the perpetrators wish to maintain control over the situation, their only option is to come out from the shadows and bare their fangs. I will wait for that moment to arrive.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 25.ogg Kamisato Ayato: But first things first, we must go and rescue Shinnojou. He has done nothing wrong, and does not deserve to be punished.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 ayato 26.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Tell me where Shinnojou is. We'll head off right now.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 hisashi 01.ogg Hisashi: Yes, Sir.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 hisashi 02.ogg Hisashi: Yes. His name is Shinnojou.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hiiragi Chisato is on a totally different page than Kujou Kamaji...
Media:vo lrlq001 26 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ayato, why did you give her such vague suggestions? Couldn't you just have told her what you'd do in her position? 'Cause Paimon's pretty sure you have an idea.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Strange? In what way?
Media:vo lrlq001 26 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Shinnojou?
Media:vo lrlq001 26 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Aah! That's the second time you've done that! Paimon cannot deal with this...
Media:vo lrlq001 26 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: But why did they suspect him, and not us?
Media:vo lrlq001 26 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: *gasp* No way! Whew... lucky Paimon didn't say anything stupid.
Media:vo lrlq001 26 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Ah! But Chisato got what you meant about the letter though, right?
Media:vo lrlq001 26 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Whew, marriage is such a trap...
Media:vo lrlq001 26 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Um... so what're we gonna do?
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Greetings, both. I have long been indebted to you on my sister's behalf. Finally, I have the chance to express my profoundest gratitude to you in person.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Ayaka is out today. If you are here regarding anything related to the Kamisato Clan, you are quite welcome to discuss it with me instead.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Haha, you shower me with praise undeserved, my little guest.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 04.ogg Kamisato Ayato: There is no need to be quite so formal. This is a private residence, so please relax.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 05.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Oh? I wouldn't have thought you'd heard about that yet.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 06.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I see... Well, it's true. It wasn't long ago that I received the news myself.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 07.ogg Kamisato Ayato: The head clans of two Commissions are to become joined through marriage. This is big news, for the whole of Inazuma.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 08.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Since the Yashiro Commission presides over cultural and ceremonial affairs, it closely involves us, too.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 09.ogg Kamisato Ayato: It is. High-profile matrimonial links between two commissions are extremely rare, but these two truly love each other. Tradition should give way to freedom in this case.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 10.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Hmm...
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 11.ogg Kamisato Ayato: No need. I'll visit them personally this time.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 12.ogg Kamisato Ayato: This is a marriage between the Kujou Clan and the Hiiragi Clan. The Kamisato Clan must demonstrate an appropriate level of respect.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 13.ogg Kamisato Ayato: The work of the Yashiro Commission is indeed multifarious. Normally, weddings and other ceremonies would come under the supervision of my sister.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 14.ogg Kamisato Ayato: But she is presently occupied with other matters, and I happen to have a little time to spare. This will be a good chance for me to pay a visit to the bride and groom.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 15.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Oh — and would you two care to join me?
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 16.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I presume you two have a special connection with the individuals in question, or you would not be quite so interested in this matter.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 17.ogg Kamisato Ayato: This being the case, why not come and offer your best wishes too? Or... is my presumption incorrect?
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 18.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I cannot thank you enough. Your mere presence shall surely mean we are spared the futile pursuit known as small talk.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 19.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Ahaha... small talk is a chore. Of course, there are some people in the world who quite enjoy doing chores... but I am not one of them.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 ayato 20.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Thoma, I'm heading out with my two guests now. I'll leave the residence in your capable hands.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh, uh... hi... Your flattering words... flatter us. Um, please excuse the sudden... -ness of our visit, for it is most improper etiquette...
Media:vo lrlq001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Well, he seems like a pretty powerful person... He's already working his way up Paimon's list of people to never mess with...
Media:vo lrlq001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Look! As soon as he stands up, the whole atmosphere in the room changes and it feels like you've gotta be super polite!
Media:vo lrlq001 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, good! 'Cause that whole spiel was really tiring just now! Alright, now that that's over, Paimon's just gonna ask the question.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: We heard a rumor that Kujou Kamaji and Hiiragi Chisato are gonna get married soon. Do you know anything about that?
Media:vo lrlq001 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Right, makes sense.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Ah, two true lovers becoming husband and wife. What a happy occasion!
Media:vo lrlq001 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Oh, it's not as interesting as you make it sound... No special connections here. Super-ordinary ones, actually.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: We just agreed to help deliver a letter this one time, that's all... Although, wait... does that mean we helped make this wedding happen!?
Media:vo lrlq001 4 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Huh, alright then...
Media:vo lrlq001 4 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Wait, you're the Yashiro Commissioner, but you can't do small talk?
Media:vo lrlq001 4 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Hahaha, why on earth are you talking like that?
Media:vo lrlq001 4 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Yes. And since the commissions are kind of the face of the Almighty Shogun to the masses, this wedding is one that we have to treat as a serious affair.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Alright then. I'll be sure to pay them a visit to send the best wishes of the Kamisato Clan.
Media:vo lrlq001 4 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Huh? But you have other things to be doing...
Media:vo lrlq001 4 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Not a problem. Take care, my lord.
Media:vo lrlq001 6 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Hmm? Who are these two?
Media:vo lrlq001 6 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: It is a little inappropriate for me to have shared news of this magnitude with you. So I would be much obliged if you could keep it in strict confidence until an official public announcement is made.
Media:vo lrlq001 6 ayato 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: That puts my mind at ease. Now, on the topic, we'd like to pay a visit to the Kujou Clan. Would you mind leading the way for us?
Media:vo lrlq001 6 ippei 01.ogg Ippei: Ahh, you're finally—
Media:vo lrlq001 6 ippei 02.ogg Ippei: Great! So our hunch was spot on!
Media:vo lrlq001 6 ippei 03.ogg Ippei: Don't worry, Sir. We... we give you our word, we won't tell anyone about it!
Media:vo lrlq001 6 ippei 04.ogg Ippei: Of course not. I'd be honored!
Media:vo lrlq001 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: They're friends of ours. Paimon will do the introductions!
Media:vo lrlq001 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Cheer up, Shinnojou!
Media:vo lrlq001 6 shinnojou 01.ogg Shinnojou: Ah! Yashiro Commissioner!?
Media:vo lrlq001 6 shinnojou 02.ogg Shinnojou: So it's true...
Media:vo lrlq001 6 shinnojou 03.ogg Shinnojou: Well, there we have it... That's it, then. So be it.
Media:vo lrlq001 6 shinnojou 04.ogg Shinnojou: I guess this is where I... Goodbye, then...
Media:vo lrlq001 6 shinnojou 05.ogg Shinnojou: I'll try. Thank you.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I don't mean to impose, Sir Kujou. In fact, I'm not here on official business at all.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I heard the good news about yourself and Lady Hiiragi. What a glorious marital alliance this shall be. Given the close ties between our clans, it seemed only right that I should come and offer the Kamisato Clan's congratulations in person.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: You're far too modest. The public thinks very highly of you. They say you're hard-working, upright, and responsible.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 04.ogg Kamisato Ayato: It's perfectly alright. Please, continue. I'm quite content to listen.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 05.ogg Kamisato Ayato: It's a joyous occasion. Light-hearted is exactly how things should be. Really, who stays stony-faced when talking about a wedding?
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 06.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Haha, of course not. Where there is true love, nothing should be allowed to stand in its way.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 07.ogg Kamisato Ayato: No doubt people will offer you a colorful variety of opinions. But of course, you will have factored this into your decision, and I'm sure you are prepared for whatever challenges may lie ahead.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 08.ogg Kamisato Ayato: So, please be confident. When your mind is made up, you ought not be worried about things for which you are already well-prepared.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 09.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Nevertheless, there is just one small aspect of this that puzzles me a little...
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 10.ogg Kamisato Ayato: You've been working hard to bring the Tenryou Commission in line. This is positive, and no doubt the beginning of an important change. But on the other side of this equation, Lady Hiiragi's father, Hiiragi Shinsuke, is still in prison.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 11.ogg Kamisato Ayato: If you choose now, of all moments, to announce a marriage between the Hiiragi and Kujou Clans, the kinds of rumors that may begin to spread, both among the general public and in the Kanjou Commission, are not likely to be in either of your best interests.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 12.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I can see where you're coming from. But you're only postponing the problem, not solving it. You will still have to face it sooner or later.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 13.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Oh...
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 14.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Okay. So you discussed it and decided on a date.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 15.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Far from it. On the contrary, seeing you so positively smitten puts my mind at rest.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 16.ogg Kamisato Ayato: No surer evidence could there be of your true feelings and your commitment. If I had any reservations before, I certainly don't now.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 17.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I wish you a joyous wedding when the day comes.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ayato 18.ogg Kamisato Ayato: We have some other business to attend to now. Until next time.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 ippei 01.ogg Ippei: Alright then. Please excuse me, I'll leave you to it from here.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 01.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Okay. Thanks, Ippei.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 02.ogg Kujou Kamaji: I apologize that your impromptu visit comes at a busy time for us, Commissioner. Otherwise, you can be sure that we would've prepared a more extravagant reception.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 03.ogg Kujou Kamaji: I'm truly honored. I hope the news didn't come as too much of a surprise...
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 04.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Since the incident with the Takatsukasa Clan, things in the Tenryou Commission have slowly started to stabilize.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 05.ogg Kujou Kamaji: I'm still acclimating to the position of acting head of the Clan. I just hope I'm up to the task, so I can live up to everyone's expectations.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 06.ogg Kujou Kamaji: I'm flattered, but I wouldn't have achieved anything without the support of my people. Thanks to them, everything is gradually stabilizing, and I've finally had the chance to focus a little on my personal life.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 07.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Hehe, come on now. You're embarrassing me...
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 08.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Ah! Pardon me, I, um...
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 09.ogg Kujou Kamaji: You're right.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 10.ogg Kujou Kamaji: But I am curious to know — what's your honest opinion on the whole thing? Do you think it's... too sudden?
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 11.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Indeed I am.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 12.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Please go ahead.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 13.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Yeah...
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 14.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Couldn't have put it better myself, Sir Kamisato. This has been my biggest concern for quite a while now.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 15.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Hiiragi Shinsuke is firmly against me having any contact at all with Chisato. In the past, we've always had to communicate in secret, by sending letters.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 16.ogg Kujou Kamaji: So although now may not look like the best timing for this marriage, it may well be the only opportunity we have.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 17.ogg Kujou Kamaji: *sigh* Yes, I'm well aware of that. But since Chisato had the courage to ask me to marry her in spite of everything, how can I disappoint her?
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 18.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Well, sort of... She raised the idea in a letter, and after some initial hesitation, I went to meet her and have a serious conversation about our future.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 19.ogg Kujou Kamaji: It's funny, actually, because when I formally proposed to her in person, she denied having ever written that letter... Ah, so coy...
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 20.ogg Kujou Kamaji: She didn't say, she just acted confused by the whole thing. She really committed to it. I'll never forget the look on her face.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 21.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Anyway, as her boyfriend, I knew she was just pretending. So, I played along and said "Ah, I was only joking about the letter"... Then, I proposed.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 22.ogg Kujou Kamaji: After making some disgruntled noises about me making a stupid joke, she blushed and said yes. We spent that afternoon working through all the details of the wedding.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 23.ogg Kujou Kamaji: We did. I guess... it was a chance to finally express our commitment to one another, clearly and completely.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 24.ogg Kujou Kamaji: And you know what? I think it was about time.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 25.ogg Kujou Kamaji: No matter what happens next... I will always be there for her as the one person she can always rely on.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 26.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Ah...!
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 27.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Apologies, my friends, and also to Sir Kamisato... I must sound like a fool.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 28.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Thank you all, it means a lot.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 kujoukamaji 29.ogg Kujou Kamaji: Very well. I'll see you out.
Media:vo lrlq001 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey there! We came to congratulate you as well!
Media:vo lrlq001 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hehe, well you're certainly making big progress in that department!
Media:vo lrlq001 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: ...Oh! That guy! Yeah, he acts like this sweet old man, but he was determined to make as much trouble for us as possible! Oh, he is the worst...
Media:vo lrlq001 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? ...Really?
Media:vo lrlq001 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Argh, gimme a break...
Media:vo lrlq001 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Sorry, but Paimon's been wanting to say this the whole time! Is it just this dude, or does everyone in love act like this? He just won't stop talking!
Media:vo lrlq001 7 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Yeah, even if it's kinda irritating to see you all smug like this, it's still a happy occasion. Good luck on the day, and have a happy wedding!
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: You're right. Kujou Kamaji is on cloud nine.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: What do you think, Traveler?
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: He chalked it up to her being coy, but... that doesn't sound like the Hiiragi Chisato I know.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 04.ogg Kamisato Ayato: It bothers me also. But unfortunately, attempting to seek the truth of the matter would likely be fruitless.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 05.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I see. So that's how adventurers think.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 06.ogg Kamisato Ayato: In my opinion, we face two obstacles in this case. Firstly, we have very little information to go on, and I must be cautious about taking a stance. This makes it difficult to investigate.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 07.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Secondly, and more importantly, the person involved doesn't seem to care.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 08.ogg Kamisato Ayato: If we intervene without his blessing, good intentions may lead to catastrophic results.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 09.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Everything in the world is intertwined. What looks like a simple outcome is often the result of multiple conflating reasons.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 10.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Seeking the full truth would be a long and laborious process. It would be inefficient.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 11.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Sort of. I have to take this approach, or the work of the Yashiro Commissioner would never be done.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 12.ogg Kamisato Ayato: My opinion is something like this: When something strange happens, instead of trying to find out what could have caused it, it is better to look at the situation itself.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 13.ogg Kamisato Ayato: If the outcome is positive, and no one was deceived or harmed in the process, then it is acceptable.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 14.ogg Kamisato Ayato: We don't know yet. After all, we don't know what Hiiragi Chisato's thoughts are, do we?
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 15.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I have to say, I'm impressed by your ability to zero in on the issue from such a short meeting. Most insightful of you. You are thorough and thoughtful, just as my sister describes.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 16.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Only if we are to take Kujou Kamaji at his word. But there are two sides to every story.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 17.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I wish to know Hiiragi Chisato's angle on this.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 18.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Don't worry about it. I was planning to visit the Hiiragi Clan to deliver my best wishes anyway. Let's take the opportunity to hear her thoughts.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 19.ogg Kamisato Ayato: If she's as committed as Kujou Kamaji, perhaps they can navigate the challenges ahead successfully. But if not...
Media:vo lrlq001 9 ayato 20.ogg Kamisato Ayato: ...Well, life isn't always a smooth journey.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: He seems busy. That must be true for anyone about to get married, right? It's a happy kind of busy, though.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yeah, how come? Whenever we come across stuff like this on our adventures, we always find a way to get to the bottom of it.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You do have a point... Kamaji doesn't seem worried at all.
Media:vo lrlq001 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? But... Chisato and Kamaji have already talked everything through, haven't they?
Media:vo lrlq001 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh... Makes sense, but Paimon still doesn't quite get it...
Media:vo lrlq001 cs ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: That voice... Thoma, would that happen to be the Traveler?
Media:vo lrlq001 cs ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Greetings, Traveler. Ayaka speaks of you constantly. Finally, today is the day
Media:vo lrlq001 cs ayato 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I am head of the Kamisato Clan, and Yashiro Commissioner — Kamisato Ayato
Media:vo lrlq001 cs paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ayaka, Thoma, it's us!
Media:vo lrlq001 cs thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Without looking at the board, you've ruined my strategy in one move. Amazing
Media:vo lrlq001 cs thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Hmm... Now what should I do next...
Media:vo lrlq001 cs thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Hey guys! It's been a while
Media:vo lrlq001 cs thoma 04.ogg Thoma: If you're looking for milady, I'm afraid... she's not here right now
Media:vo lrlq001 cs thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Yes
Observe Chessboard: (Kamisato Ayato did not look at the board the entire time... Can he really remember the whole board, right down to the last tile?)
Observe Chessboard: (The state of the chess game remains unfinished, though Thoma seems to be at a slight disadvantage.)
You introduce your companions to Ayato and update Ippei and Shinnojou on the situation.
You part ways with Kujou Kamaji. Kamisato Ayato seems to have some more to say to you
