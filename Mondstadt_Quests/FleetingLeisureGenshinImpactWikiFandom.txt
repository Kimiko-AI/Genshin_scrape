 ...So Quinn feels that Bea has nothing important to say to him...
 But let's think about what Quinn might like...
 Didn't we say we were going to take a break?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: I—I'm so sorry!
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: But as a maid of Favonius, I can't stand idly by when people are in need.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: I'll do some serious planning and make sure we can have a day off together another time!
 So even a break requires serious planning...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: Indeed. But today... can you help Bea come up with a solution?
 Well, if you insist...
 Gifts convey our intentions, we should choose carefully.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 29.ogg Noelle: That's what I think!
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 30.ogg Noelle: Everyone has their preferences, so it's important to choose the right gift if you want to get through to them.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 31.ogg Noelle: If it were me, I'd want roses.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 32.ogg Noelle: As for you, Honorary Knight... hmm...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 33.ogg Noelle: I bet you like handmade things...
 Roses and handmade things both sound nice.
 But let's think about what Quinn might like...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 34.ogg Noelle: Oh, yes! I... I just wanted to try thinking from a different perspective...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 35.ogg Noelle: Hmm... Quinn... What kind of gift would he like...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 36.ogg Noelle: If I remember correctly, isn't Quinn one of the Four Drunkards of Mondstadt...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 37.ogg Noelle: Perhaps something wine-related would do, but what...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 38.ogg Noelle: Hmm, simply thinking about it isn't really helping...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 39.ogg Noelle: Let's go to Marjorie's store and see what's available.
(Proceed to Gift and Intent (Sincerest of Gifts))
 I'll certainly do my best...
 It shouldn't matter, it's the thought that counts.

Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 24.ogg Noelle: Are you sure? I still feel the choice of gift matters... no matter what kind of relationship two people share.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 25.ogg Noelle: But, I don't have any experience in this area. I'm sure you're right.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 26.ogg Noelle: Then... if the gift doesn't matter, the choices are limitless... I can't decide...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 27.ogg Noelle: Do you have any ideas?
 Sending a Mondstadt Grilled Fish should be fine.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 28.ogg Noelle: Huh... Will this really get his attention?
(Proceed to Gift and Intent (It's the Heart That Matters))
 Let's analyze the situation first...
 Maybe the frequent small talk...
 Quest DescriptionNoelle, who aims to become a Knight of Favonius, has shared her troubles with you and hopes that you'll be able to help her with her chivalric training. To get the workaholic Noelle some rest, you suggest that the two of you have some tea and let loose a little...
 Roses and handmade things both sound nice.
 Sending a Mondstadt Grilled Fish should be fine.

Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 01.ogg Beatrice: Noelle—
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 02.ogg Beatrice: Quinn! He's ignoring me again...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 03.ogg Beatrice: I... *whimpers* ...noticed Quinn was in a bad mood, so I wanted to call him over for a chat...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 04.ogg Beatrice: And... a date, I guess.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 05.ogg Beatrice: Yes! I've been over to him several times today already...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 06.ogg Beatrice: But no matter how I try to make conversation, he just focuses on his stall and ignores me completely!
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 07.ogg Beatrice: Noelle, everyone in Mondstadt thinks you're really cute...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 08.ogg Beatrice: You must be really popular, right? Can you help me out...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 beatrice 09.ogg Beatrice: *sigh* ...Even Noelle can't help me...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Are there any particular snacks you like? I can get started with —
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: ...Oh, no need? I should take a break...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Oh, okay then... In that case, let's head to Good Hunter and have a look...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: B—Bea...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: What happened? Is there something I can help you with?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Take your time, no rush. I'm here to help.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Oh? A d—date...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: So it's... that kind of problem?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Ah! Of... of course! It's a maid's responsibility to help the residents of Mondstadt!
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: It's just... I... I don't have any experience in this area...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Please, don't worry! I... Oh! We also have the Honorary Knight here!
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Honorary Knight... can you help Bea?

Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: Okay! Bea said that Quinn always seems busy and ignores everything she says...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: But... I know that she's often looking for small talk with Quinn...
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 20.ogg Noelle: That's... a possibility!
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 21.ogg Noelle: In other words... we just need to make Quinn realize that this time is different.
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 22.ogg Noelle: For example... by sending him a little gift. Even Quinn would realize the difference a gift would bring!
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 23.ogg Noelle: But what kind of gift...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906701 noelle 24.ogg Noelle: Are you sure? I still feel the choice of gift matters... no matter what kind of relationship two people share.
