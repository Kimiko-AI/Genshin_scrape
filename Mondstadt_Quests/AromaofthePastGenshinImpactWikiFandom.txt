Diona - Kätzlein Cocktail
Diona, the bartender at The Cat's Tail, hates all alcoholic beverages, but has a rare talent for bartending.
No matter the drink, as long as the mixing is in her hands, it will be unimaginably delicious.
Her excellent bartending skills and her cat's ears and tail that run in her family, are popular among punters, making The Cat's Tail extremely popular.
However, please take care not to touch Diona's ears or tail when ordering at the bar. If you cross her, the consequences will be dire.

(Bennett, Klee, Razor, Venti, Paimon, and the Traveler explore the Wine Festival venue when the wind starts to blow)
Razor: Klee
Razor: Listen
(Wind chimes jingle amidst the wind)
Klee: The wind!
Klee: The Anemo God is coming!
Bennett: Alright!
(Bennett, Klee, and Razor run off. The Traveler turns to Venti, who winks and places a finger to his lips and says "Shh," before summoning his powers)
(In the City of Mondstadt, Diona holds a bottle of wine away from Draff while Rosaria looks on in amusement, before reminiscing on the words of an unidentified man, possibly the old bandit who had kidnapped her in her youth)
Male Voice: Take this
Male Voice: Crush it, and place it on the fracture
Male Voice: Listen, missy
Male Voice: Promise me
Male Voice: You'll live on
(Kaeya departs from the Dawn Winery, reminiscing on his father's last words to him before abandoning him in Mondstadt)
Kaeya's Father: This is where you must stay
Kaeya's Father: You are our only hope
Kaeya's Father: Forgive me
Kaeya's Father: Kaeya
(Diluc, inside the Dawn Winery, reminisces on his father Crepus's words)
Crepus: Good
Crepus: Very good
Crepus: That's my boy
Crepus: I will always be proud of you
(Razor takes a sniff of the Thousand-Wind Wine and suddenly has a vision of his parents)
Razor's Father: After all the time we spent on it
Razor's Father: The wine still isn't ready
Razor's Father: May as well leave it for our son
Razor's Mother: "Razor"
Razor's Mother: What do you think of that name?
Razor's Father: Ooh!
Razor's Father: An adventurer's name
Razor's Father: Yes
Razor's Father: I like it
(Razor's mother lays her head on her husband's shoulder as Razor reaches out to them, only to get drawn out of the vision by Klee's voice as she waves to him, with the others looking on)
Klee: Raaazooor
Klee: Razor
Klee: Come on!
(Razor takes another look at the Thousand-Wind Wind he is holding, smiles, and joins the rest of the group and they walk away, laughing together)

(If the player has not met Noelle yet, an introductory note appears on screen)
Noelle - Chivalric Blossom
Noelle, a maid of the Knights of Favonius, is known as a gentle and reliable woman who can be called upon to help in times of trouble.
Noelle rejoiced when she was given a responsibility, to be seen as a big help in a difficult situation.
To be able to help people in trouble, to lend others her strength, this in her mind is in line with the principles of chivalry.
Indeed, Noelle dreamed of becoming a full Knight. In order to realize this dream, she has been working hard.

(If the player has not met Sucrose yet, an introductory note appears on screen)
Sucrose - Harmless Sweetie
Sucrose is an alchemist from Mondstadt with an insatiable curiosity towards the natural world, leading her to focus on bio-alchemy in her research.
Whether it be a special potion that increases the nectar output of Sweet Flowers or a special spray that keeps Sunsettias fresh, Sucrose is always finding ways to use bio-alchemical techniques to add variety and color to this world.
Perhaps it is because Sucrose channels most of her energy into her experiments and research that she comes off as a bit shy in social situations.
 "Spend your life doing what you love."

 About Razor...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04a 1.ogg Diluc: *sigh* I can sympathize with the anguish of being away from family.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04a 2.ogg Diluc: Certainly, a tragic situation. But tragedy can also drive personal growth, and perhaps learning how to face it head-on is part of growing up... part of becoming an adult.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04a 3.ogg Diluc: Having the support of some good friends will certainly make that journey easier.
 About Razor...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 1.ogg Lisa: It's funny — I always thought the Grand Master was the one who gave him the name "Razor"...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 2.ogg Lisa: But it turns out his birth parents chose it all along.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 3.ogg Lisa: ...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 4.ogg Lisa: Anyway, Razor told me he heard the voices of his parents during the festival.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 5.ogg Lisa: "Like stepping on a rock in the sun. Warm, but also heavy."
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 6.ogg Lisa: I'm sure he must think of them as both kind and dauntless people...
 About Razor...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04b 1.ogg Rosaria: So, he's finally come to terms with everything?
 At the very least, he's no longer lost and confused.
 He has a direction now.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04b 2.ogg Rosaria: Hmm, sounds like he still has some way to go before he can say he's fully independent. But everyone goes through their own life in their own way.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04b 3.ogg Rosaria: Well done. It sounds like your efforts were all worth it in the end.
 About Razor...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04c 1.ogg Sucrose: I'm sorry for running off back then...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04c 2.ogg Sucrose: I just thought that you and Noelle would do a better job of expressing things than I could...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04c 3.ogg Sucrose: Did everything work out in the end? Mixing the Epsilon-Series Tetrasweet Sunsettia, Variation 63 with the other ingredients didn't cause any problems, did it?
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04c 4.ogg Sucrose: Oh, and uh... how did things go with Razor...
 Don't worry. Everything turned out great.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04c 5.ogg Sucrose: Phew... Thank goodness.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04c 6.ogg Sucrose: Then... can I ask you for a favor? I want to make a note of the full recipe for the Thousand-Wind Wine we made.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04c 7.ogg Sucrose: That way, we'll be able to recreate the exact same flavor we did today in the future, no matter how many years go by.
 About Razor...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 1.ogg Venti: He's grown up so much recently... It's such a joy to see.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 2.ogg Venti: Huh... Suddenly I sound just like an old grandpa.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 3.ogg Venti: He was lucky to have friends like you ready to support him through all this.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 4.ogg Venti: I see a kind, gentle soul, with a healthy dose of romance and freedom, too... In other words, a true Mondstadter, who grew up drinking the water of Cider Lake.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 5.ogg Venti: You, on the other hand... Don't worry, you're the gentlest soul I've ever met.
 About Varka...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07a 1.ogg Lisa: I was quite surprised to learn that the Grand Master had written a private message just for me.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07a 2.ogg Lisa: And I was equally surprised to find out that Razor's been on his mind this whole time.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07a 3.ogg Lisa: Especially given how demanding he is of Jean... He left her to figure out the whole Weinlesefest on her own, and didn't give her a single word of acknowledgment.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07a 4.ogg Lisa: I'll have to have to a stern word with him on Jean's behalf when he returns.
 About Varka...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06a 1.ogg Razor: The message in the letter... I want to thank him.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06a 2.ogg Razor: ...I miss him. Lupical miss him, too.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06a 3.ogg Razor: Now, I am grown up.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06a 4.ogg Razor: I want to hear him talk about human father and mother.
 About Varka...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04a 1.ogg Rosaria: Oh. Yes, I read his letter. Barbara showed it to me.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04a 2.ogg Rosaria: She'd been so worried about her father, Seamus. She almost burst into tears when she read that "the expedition is safe and all of its members are accounted for."
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04a 3.ogg Rosaria: Hmm? ...My thoughts?
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04a 4.ogg Rosaria: Hehe... You're curious what he means to me as a father figure, is that right? Well, I guess I'm not like other daughters. I can't bring myself to worry about him.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04a 5.ogg Rosaria: He wouldn't be leading that many people if he didn't have the necessary strength and courage for it. He's not the kind of person you need to worry about.
 About drinking...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04c 1.ogg Venti: Oh, I've been very busy on that front. I'd long since drunk my fill by Windcoming Day.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04c 2.ogg Venti: But, uh, I wasn't counting on everyone bringing out their finest vintage to welcome me.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04c 3.ogg Venti: Ah, the fragrance alone was so intoxicating... I had no choice but to make room for a few more rounds...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 05.ogg Venti: Full disclosure — I also secretly hid two bottles away for myself at the end.
 About friends...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06c 1.ogg Razor: A long time ago, I thought I was alone. Only have lupical.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06c 2.ogg Razor: Now, I know many people.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06c 3.ogg Razor: Everyone helps me. I will help everyone, too.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06c 4.ogg Razor: Humans, wolves, everyone.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 07.ogg Razor: I am the bridge between city and outside.
 About the Weinlesefest...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04c 1.ogg Diluc: To the people of Mondstadt, wine-making is a way of working through emotions, and remembering our history.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04c 2.ogg Diluc: We're only able to make such high-quality wines these days thanks to the peace we enjoy. War is a thing of the distant past.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04c 3.ogg Diluc: Even though you might not see me reveling with the crowds, I am grateful for this as much as anyone.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04c 4.ogg Diluc: Say, have you tried our latest product, "Fruits of the Festival"?
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04c 5.ogg Diluc: If you have any thoughts on how it could be improved, I'm all ears.
 About the Weinlesefest...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07c 1.ogg Lisa: Originally, I only planned on having a glass or two. I thought I deserved a treat after being such a good teacher recently.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07c 2.ogg Lisa: But that was before I came to appreciate how truly exceptional the festival-exclusive vintage was...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07c 3.ogg Lisa: Before I knew it, I was already rather tipsy, hehe...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07c 4.ogg Lisa: I'm a bad example. Don't be like me, cutie.
 About the Weinlesefest...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04c 1.ogg Rosaria: I thought that if I made it to the Weinlesefest, I'd have the chance to spend a whole day in the tavern. Turns out, there's actually more work during a festival than usual.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04c 2.ogg Rosaria: I managed to escape to here, but I still can't completely let my guard down. Who knows when Victoria or Dahlia might show up and drag me off to the sung poetry event.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04c 3.ogg Rosaria: *sigh* The sooner this festival is over, the better.
 About the blessings...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04a 1.ogg Venti: Blessings? Oh, that.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04a 2.ogg Venti: Between you and me... I breathed a sigh of relief when nobody said their wishes out loud during the toast. That would've really put me in a tough spot. Hahaha... The Anemo Archon, Barbatos, doesn't have unlimited power, you know.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04a 3.ogg Venti: I had to take a really deep breath to get the winds of the far-flung past blowing. I nearly went blue in the face.
 About the voices...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04b 1.ogg Diluc: ...When I unsealed the wine, it seemed that the words of my late father were sealed inside.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04b 2.ogg Diluc: I wonder what he would think if he were to see me now.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04b 3.ogg Diluc: Somehow, I doubt he'd share the same view as he did back then.
 Of course he would.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04b 4.ogg Diluc: Heh...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04b 5.ogg Diluc: If you say so.
 About your Bio-Alchemy products...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04b 1.ogg Sucrose: I have here the Iota-Series Rapid-Acting Deep Freeze Mist Flower, the Theta-Series Fragrance-Enhanced Sweet Flower, Variation 21...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04b 2.ogg Sucrose: And the Epsilon-Series Tetrasweet Sunsettia, Variation 63. I'm proud to put my name to all of these products!
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04b 3.ogg Sucrose: You won't need me to read out all the details, right?
 About your parents...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06b 1.ogg Razor: Their voices. I heard them.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06b 2.ogg Razor: Human father and mother... were adventurers...

 About your stall...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04a 1.ogg Sucrose: Oh, this?
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04a 2.ogg Sucrose: I actually wrote out all the nutritional information and prices for my Bio-Alchemy products in advance. But the customers still prefer to ask directly...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04a 3.ogg Sucrose: So... I just read off the sheet for them...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04a 4.ogg Sucrose: Running a stall is a huge challenge for me.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04a 5.ogg Sucrose: Maybe I could get Noelle to interact with the customers, and I do the rest... Mmm, no, never mind... She's probably busy enough already.
 Absolutely not.
 At the very least, he's no longer lost and confused.
 Aw, Razor...

Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04a 2.ogg Venti: Between you and me... I breathed a sigh of relief when nobody said their wishes out loud during the toast. That would've really put me in a tough spot. Hahaha... The Anemo Archon, Barbatos, doesn't have unlimited power, you know.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04a 3.ogg Venti: I had to take a really deep breath to get the winds of the far-flung past blowing. I nearly went blue in the face.
 About Razor...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 1.ogg Venti: He's grown up so much recently... It's such a joy to see.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 2.ogg Venti: Huh... Suddenly I sound just like an old grandpa.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 3.ogg Venti: He was lucky to have friends like you ready to support him through all this.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 4.ogg Venti: I see a kind, gentle soul, with a healthy dose of romance and freedom, too... In other words, a true Mondstadter, who grew up drinking the water of Cider Lake.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 5.ogg Venti: You, on the other hand... Don't worry, you're the gentlest soul I've ever met.
 About drinking...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04c 1.ogg Venti: Oh, I've been very busy on that front. I'd long since drunk my fill by Windcoming Day.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04c 2.ogg Venti: But, uh, I wasn't counting on everyone bringing out their finest vintage to welcome me.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04c 3.ogg Venti: Ah, the fragrance alone was so intoxicating... I had no choice but to make room for a few more rounds...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 05.ogg Venti: Full disclosure — I also secretly hid two bottles away for myself at the end.
 Don't worry, Diona, you got this!
 Don't worry. Everything turned out great.
 He has a direction now.
 I don't think so...
 I'll leave you in peace.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 02b 1.ogg Diluc: Sure. We'll talk when you're free.
 I'll leave you in peace.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 05b 1.ogg Lisa: Alright, but remember, it's important to rest when you're feeling tired. It makes my heart ache to see you so busy all the time.
 I'll leave you in peace.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 04b 1.ogg Razor: Okay. You go enjoy the wind.
 I'll leave you in peace.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 02b 1.ogg Rosaria: Alright. But don't tell anyone else that I'm here. I don't want to have to move anytime soon.
 I'll leave you in peace.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 02b 1.ogg Sucrose: Oh, sure. No problem.
 I'll leave you in peace.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 02b 1.ogg Venti: Then go, my friend. The stories that unfolded here shall be remembered by the wind in the form of verse.
 It makes us happy to see you happy.
 It will remind us of this moment.
 No way.
 Of course he would.
 Paimon, shush.
 Quest DescriptionThe Knights have provided Razor with the ingredients he needs, and preparations seem to almost be complete. Head over to the Knights of Favonius Headquarters to check in on them.
 She's a little busy with work.
 Step DescriptionAfter the wine-brewing materials are ready, the production of "Thousand-Wind Wine" is about to enter the final step...
 Step DescriptionRazor's sealed the barrel for his Thousand-Wind Wine and the grand toasting ceremony of the Weinlesefest is just days away...
 The alchemist girl also had a message to pass on...
 There's another reason, isn't there?
 This is more than sufficient.
 To the Anemo Archon.
 We are all glad to help.
 Will I get some, too?
 You can do it, Diona!
"A defender's will, strong as yesteryear,Joining the thousand winds in a song of good cheer,Turning sour into sweet, bitter notes fade away,As we wait, wait for a windier day."
"Fill up the barrels and store them away,Then wait, wait for a windier day.Wax the bottles, seal them tight,For the south wind that soothes, for the north wind that bites."
"How does this fine wine taste to the tongue?As 'Mondstadt' to the ear: like a sweet dream of freedom.And what are the fruits that went into the brew?An explorer's courage, a love tender and true."
"Pray tell, what treasure does this barrel hold?'Tis wheat's greatest triumph, the true liquid gold.As it flows from the keg, what sound drifts by?Wind chimes in the boundless, immemorial sky."
"We raise up our glasses, and voices in song,As we wait, wait for the wind to sing along.Where do we turn once the thousand winds take flight?To the tales of the lyre, to the sweet dream of tonight."
(Sucrose leaves the scene hastily)
Bennett: Alright!
Crepus: Good
Crepus: I will always be proud of you
Crepus: That's my boy
Crepus: Very good
Diona - Kätzlein Cocktail
Diona puts her signature mixological magic to work...
Diona, the bartender at The Cat's Tail, hates all alcoholic beverages, but has a rare talent for bartending.
Her excellent bartending skills and her cat's ears and tail that run in her family, are popular among punters, making The Cat's Tail extremely popular.
However, please take care not to touch Diona's ears or tail when ordering at the bar. If you cross her, the consequences will be dire.
Indeed, Noelle dreamed of becoming a full Knight. In order to realize this dream, she has been working hard.
Kaeya's Father: Forgive me

Klee: Come on!
Klee: Raaazooor
Klee: Razor
Klee: The Anemo God is coming!
Klee: The wind!
Male Voice: Crush it, and place it on the fracture
Male Voice: Listen, missy
Male Voice: Promise me
Male Voice: Take this
Male Voice: You'll live on
Media:vo dialog jnjeq003 klee 01.ogg Klee: Razor, you were sooo cool back there!
Media:vo dialog jnjeq003 klee 02.ogg Klee: No, not like that. When you think something's awesome, you can say it's "cool," or "sweet"!
Media:vo dialog jnjeq003 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Overall, I think this task was a success...
Media:vo dialog jnjeq003 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Oh no! Sucrose's lab equipment! I should go help her carry it!
(Noelle leaves)
Media:vo dialog jnjeq003 razor 01.ogg Razor: Cool? But inside, I feel warm...
Media:vo dialog jnjeq003 razor 02.ogg Razor: Oh... Hmm, but I think Klee is sweet.
Media:vo jnjeq003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Lisa said that the Knights of Favonius would help us get ingredients for Razor's wine, right? They should probably be ready by now.
Media:vo jnjeq003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's go check.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Sucrose! Wait!
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Honorary Knight (Traveler), Paimon, please stop her!
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Sucrose and I agreed to present the wine ingredient to you together. But when she heard that Razor will be showing up, she insisted that she won't spend a moment longer here than she has to.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: That won't do! We worked on this together and we should present it together. I can't take credit for what you did.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Yes, it's a Quadruple-Sweetness Sunsettia.

Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Okay, um, let me give you the full story.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: I love the scent of wine, and after reading up on the art of wine-making, I have grasped some of the key principles.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: In short, whatever ingredients you use, it's essential to include something sweet.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: In an attempt to select the most suitable ingredient, I gathered samples of all the sweet plants and fruits I could find in the Mondstadt area. Then, I tried them all in turn and took detailed notes.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: I also factored in the differences between the same ingredient grown in different locations. For instance, Sweet Flowers from Springvale are a little sweeter than those at Cape Oath.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: It was no problem at all. Just my duty as a Maid of Favonius!
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: The chance to source the "defender's will" on behalf of the Knights of Favonius is a huge honor for me!
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: Um, anyway, I was worried that my evaluation would be too subjective if only I were involved. Thankfully, I ran into Sucrose the other day on her way out of the lab...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: What is it, Sucrose?
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: ...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: Yeah, exactly... I'm so sorry...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: Oh, okay!
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: Anyway, Sucrose is a true professional when it comes to this kind of research! I showed her my list, and she made some extremely valuable suggestions...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: Watching Sucrose work on an experiment when she's in the zone blew me away! Such focus and determination...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 20.ogg Noelle: Aw, Sucrose...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 21.ogg Noelle: (Wow, she disappeared the moment he opened the door...)
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 22.ogg Noelle: Hello! I'm Noelle, Maid of the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 23.ogg Noelle: Here's our ingredient for you. Oh, but I can't take full credit for it! I had help from an alchemist, but right now, she... umm...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 24.ogg Noelle: Right, yes... it's a shame she couldn't be here to present it to you in person.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 25.ogg Noelle: That's right! I hope that this sweet fruit will help you brew the sweetest wine.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 26.ogg Noelle: Leave that to me! I'll figure out a way to persuade her to... ah, to not work so hard all the time, so that I can introduce you to each other!
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 27.ogg Noelle: Good luck with everything. See you next time!
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Paimon wonders how Razor's "class" has been going...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whoa, you scared Paimon!
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What's gotten the two of you so worked up?
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wait, so does this mean the Knights of Favonius' ingredient is a product of Bio-Alchemy?
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Quadruple sweetness? But aren't regular ones sweet enough as it is?
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Also... why a Sunsettia?
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Wow, that sounds like a lot of work...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Noelle, your eyes are sparkling...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: But Paimon thinks it could be because of Lisa's brainwashing...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh... That look on your faces seems to say, you forgot all about it and have been in the lab this whole time...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 11b 1.ogg Paimon: Hey! What's wrong with you?
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: That's alright, we were just chatting. ...Whoa, déjà vu. Paimon said the exact same thing two days ago...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: (Wait a sec, where did Sucrose go?)
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Wow, nothing gets past your nose, does it?
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Alright, now that we have all the ingredients, we can finally start making the wine. For that, we'll need a barrel — which, if Paimon remembers correctly, is waiting for us at the Angel's Share stand!
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Bye, Noelle! We're gonna head off now.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 razor 01.ogg Razor: Sorry. I am late again.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 razor 02.ogg Razor: Teacher, forgot about the time. Kept talking, and talking.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 razor 03.ogg Razor: Hi.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 razor 04.ogg Razor: *sniff* Smells like... potion, nectar, and Anemo Crystalfly... right?
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 razor 05.ogg Razor: This Sunsettia is sweeter than ones I have smelled before. Klee said alchemy is amazing. It can make things better.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 razor 06.ogg Razor: ...Thank you all.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 razor 07.ogg Razor: When she has time, I want to thank her, also.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 razor 08.ogg Razor: Okay, I will wait.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: I—I'm not good at dealing with strangers... Anyway, as long as the ingredient gets into the right hands, that's all that matters...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: It's not about... the credit...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Oh no!
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: I just remembered why I left the lab that day... I was supposed to go and fetch some lab equipment we imported recently...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: *sigh* Don't worry about it, it's my fault really. I'll go and see Marjorie about the equipment shortly. Carry on, Noelle.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: Please, you don't need to go out of your way to compliment me...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: Noelle filled me in on the background of the whole situation.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: I was moved to see how seriously she took this task, even though she'd never even met Razor before. However, none of the potential ingredients she had identified were perfect candidates, in my opinion.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: What we needed was a fruit high in sugar and easily fermentable. After a final look at Noelle's list, I picked the Sunsettia sample from near Cider Lake as a basis, with a view to improving it.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 10.ogg Sucrose: Using Bio-Alchemical techniques, we were able to amplify the sweetness, then conduct a few tests to compare the results against the benchmarks...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 11.ogg Sucrose: Ah, I already said don't compliment me...
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 12.ogg Sucrose: Anyway... The result of our research is the "Epsilon-Series Tetrasweet Sunsettia, Variation 63," and it's finally ready. The sweetness has been verified through rigorous testing, and the size and color are both optimal, too.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 13.ogg Sucrose: Noelle shortened the name to "Quadruple-Sweetness Sunsettia."
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 14.ogg Sucrose: Unfortunately, it can't be produced on a very large scale under the current conditions... but as long as we have enough for Razor.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 15.ogg Sucrose: (Traveler)... there's something else I'd like to share with you.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 16.ogg Sucrose: Growing up... I was lucky. I was never the best at dealing with other people, but my parents never placed any expectations on me.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 17.ogg Sucrose: They never said to me, "you need to be more sociable," or anything like that. They just said I should "do what I enjoy."
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 18.ogg Sucrose: So, I'm well aware that... I'm one of the lucky ones.
Media:vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 19.ogg Sucrose: I haven't lived Razor's life, and I can't pretend to imagine what it must have been like. So, I don't know how much it will mean coming from me, but... I truly hope that he can find happiness and spend his life doing what he loves.
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 diona 01.ogg Diona: Ooh... Traitors...
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 diona 02.ogg Diona: Arrrggghhh!!! I'm SO. MAD.
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 diona 03.ogg Diona: Klee told me the whole story. So this bright idea was the brain child of you two, hmm? How could you? Razor is Daddy's friend... and he was a good influence... right up until YOU got him interested in wine!
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 diona 04.ogg Diona: Razor, you'd better promise me that you won't turn into one of those old boozehounds that drinks themselves silly, slumps over the bar, and bursts into tears!
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 diona 05.ogg Diona: So you're saying... Razor wants to make the same wine that his mother and father once made, so he can learn more about them? ...Hmm, you'd better not be making this up to try and pull the wool over my eyes...
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 diona 06.ogg Diona: ...I—I wasn't THAT angry.
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 diona 07.ogg Diona: You were just trying to help. I understand.
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 diona 08.ogg Diona: I just don't want Razor being led astray, that's all. That's why I may have raised my voice a little bit just now... Hmm, well, since none of you plan on drinking it, then I suppose I can help you just this once, despite my reservations.
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 diona 09.ogg Diona: But I need you to know that I'm a mixer, not a brewer, so I'm used to working with the finished product. If you really want me to start with a bunch of raw ingredients, that's fine, but I can't make any promises about how it'll turn out...
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 diona 10.ogg Diona: Hmph, bunch of flatterers. Now watch this.
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 diona 11.ogg Diona: I have to keep an eye on my foolish father, so I won't be joining you.
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 diona 12.ogg Diona: Klee, come and play again some other time.
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 klee 01a.ogg Klee: Honorary Knight, Razor, over here! Look who it is!
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 klee 02a.ogg Klee: Ummmm... I told her that Razor's looking for his mommy with the Honorary Knight's help, and you both seemed really sad, and said you needed some wine, so maybe Diona could help...
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 klee 03.ogg Klee: But before I finished, Diona said, "Klee, say no more, I'm getting involved in this if it's the last thing I do." And... then we came here...
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 klee 04.ogg Klee: Sorry, Diona, it was all Klee's fault for not explaining it properly.
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 klee 05.ogg Klee: So... are you still mad? Or can you help Razor make the wine?
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 klee 06.ogg Klee: I caught a bunch of fish for us to eat. Um... and you can pet Dodoco too if you want.
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 klee 07.ogg Klee: Yay! Diona is the best!
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 klee 08.ogg Klee: Cool, I wanna come, too!
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 klee 09.ogg Klee: I will! I promise!
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow, it's Diona! Paimon was sure we'd run into you at The Cat's Tail stand some time, but so far, we haven't seen you all festival!
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uhh... Umm, wh—what?
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Sounds like there's been some crossed wires here...
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Klee, what exactly did you say to Diona?
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh... okay... Paimon doesn't even know where to start. Diona, it sounds like Klee left out a few important details in this story. Let us set the record straight...
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: All done! That was quick!
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Now we just need to find a place to store it.
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: "We wait, wait for a windier day." ...Hmm, does that mean we need to put it somewhere exposed to the wind?
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Yep! If you say the word "windy," that's the first place on every Mondstadter's mind.
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 razor 01.ogg Razor: I, uh... I don't understand.
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 razor 02.ogg Razor: Uh...
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 razor 03.ogg Razor: Hehe.
Media:vo jnjeq003 3 razor 04.ogg Razor: Maybe... Windrise? Very windy.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 klee 01.ogg Klee: Yeah, the fruit are super fresh and super-duper sweet! I can smell it as well!
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 klee 02.ogg Klee: What? We missed something!?
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 klee 03.ogg Klee: That's so cool! So now our story will be made into wine, too!
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 klee 04.ogg Klee: What is it, Razor? Whatcha thinkin' about?
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 klee 05.ogg Klee: Wow! The Anemo God is coming home!
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Tone-Deaf Bard? What are you doing here?
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Dandelion Seeds?
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Whoa!
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: We're finally done. Paimon feels like a celebration is in order!
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: If Paimon remembers correctly, tomorrow should be Windcoming Day, right?
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 01.ogg Razor: Yes, there was.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 02.ogg Razor: Hmm...
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 03.ogg Razor: In mother and father's wine, I can smell Dandelion Seeds, but I don't know what else.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 04.ogg Razor: In my wine, there is a lot of... friendship.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 05.ogg Razor: I still don't understand my mother and father, but... I still have you, and everyone else.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 06.ogg Razor: Everyone has done so much for me.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 07.ogg Razor: Varka, Teacher, Klee, Bennett, Uncle Brown Cat, cold lady, grown-up with fake smile...
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 08.ogg Razor: Grey tough girl, person that smells like Anemo Crystalfly, Uncle Browncat's daughter...
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 09.ogg Razor: Green bard, Paimon, and (Traveler).
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 10.ogg Razor: I remember everyone.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 11.ogg Razor: Making wine... is hard work.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 12.ogg Razor: Making this wine needed everyone, working together.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 13.ogg Razor: Hard work with friends... not so hard after all.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 14.ogg Razor: I'm... I'm so happy.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 15.ogg Razor: Thank you.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 16.ogg Razor: Friends... are also lupical.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 17.ogg Razor: Whether I'm human, or I'm wolf... it doesn't matter. From now on, all of us are together.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 razor 18.ogg Razor: When I grow up, we will come back here. And we will open this wine... together.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 venti 01.ogg Venti: Ah, what a curious coincidence meeting you here!
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 venti 02.ogg Venti: Well, I awoke to the most magnificent aroma in the air. After following the sweet scent of fresh fruit to its source, this is where I ended up.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 venti 03.ogg Venti: Yes. Oh ah, I remembered something important. Something that you have to do before sealing the barrel and burying it in the ground.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 venti 04.ogg Venti: Razor, do you still remember the scent of that half-bottle of Thousand-Wind Wine? I believe there was a hint of bitterness in there?
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 venti 05.ogg Venti: Hahaha, and with very good reason, too. The source? ...This.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 venti 06.ogg Venti: You're familiar with Dandelion Wine, right? Well, the people of Mondstadt believe that the wind can bring back the soul, and also preserve memories.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 venti 07.ogg Venti: Dandelion Seeds are like living gemstones, formed from the first wisps of wind in the year. People add them to the mix at the last second as a way of capturing the wind in the very moment that the barrel is sealed.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 venti 08.ogg Venti: The memory of that moment is then stored in the wine, for all time.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 venti 09.ogg Venti: So, Thousand-Wind Wine is the original Dandelion Wine.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 venti 10.ogg Venti: As for why it always has a different scent... Well, that's because people have the freedom to include whatever ingredients they want, hehe~
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 venti 11.ogg Venti: What a magnificent monologue. Even as a bard, I don't feel like there's anything else to add.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 venti 12.ogg Venti: All that remains now is to bury the barrel and wait, wait for the fruit to ferment.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 venti 13.ogg Venti: Hahaha, that reminds me — I haven't memorized the song for the toasting ceremony yet. I'd better get back. Friends, I shall see you all tomorrow.
Media:vo jnjeq003 4 venti 14.ogg Venti: Get a good night's sleep tonight. Wait for the whisper of the gentle breeze to rouse you tomorrow morning, then come and enjoy a performance by the greatest bard to ever grace the streets of Mondstadt.
Media:vo jnjeq003 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Windcoming Day is finally here. Let's get a move on, or we'll miss the toasting ceremony!
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Hey hey, there you are!
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Haha, these are for Razor, from us!
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: This bottle is from my dads. Luckily I managed not to break it on the way here... It's just for show, though, I have to give it back to them afterwards.
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: Don't forget to save me a glass of your wine once it's finished fermenting!
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: I heard that the Angel's Share is selling a new drink called "Fruits of the Festival." Everyone's saying it's delicious!
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 klee 01.ogg Klee: Mommy said that everyone is welcoming the Anemo God today, and we need to give him some wine. If the Anemo God likes the wine, he'll turn into the wind and bless everyone.
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 klee 02a.ogg Klee: We want the Anemo God to be happy so he helps Razor. Oh, Honorary Knight, look what Albedo let me borrow.
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 klee 03.ogg Klee: Mommy said that the Anemo God can drink a looot of wine. She said if he wanted to, he could drink the whole of Cider Lake in one big gulp!
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 klee 04.ogg Klee: So... d'you think we have enough between these and the wine Razor's parents left behind?
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 klee 05.ogg Klee: Umm... There's no wind...
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 klee 06.ogg Klee: But why didn't he come? If the Anemo God didn't come home... is it because he doesn't like the wine we brought for him?
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 klee 07.ogg Klee: Huh? Really? Maybe he turned into... a Jumpy Dumpty!
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 klee 08.ogg Klee: Heehee... Razor, did the Anemo Archon bring you a blessing?
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 klee 09.ogg Klee: Yay! But... now I'm getting thirsty...
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 klee 10.ogg Klee: I want some, I want some!
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 lisa 01.ogg Lisa: Tradition holds that the finest wine of the Weinlesefest only goes on sale after the Anemo Archon has tasted it at the toasting ceremony. Everyone's waiting in line for the big moment.
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 lisa 02.ogg Lisa: Yes, I was still feeling a little concerned about him. But I just spoke with him, and he tells me that the wine-making went very smoothly. Ah, such a relief... A glass of the festival's finest will go down smoothly now, too.
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 lisa 03.ogg Lisa: Hehe. Razor and the others are over there. You should go say hi.
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow, so many people have shown up to welcome the Anemo Archon. ...Huh? Why is everyone crowded around the Angel's Share stand?
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ugh, so welcoming the Anemo Archon back is just a means to an end for them, huh... What about you, Lisa? Are you here for Razor?
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wow, you too, huh...
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Whoa, what's with all these bottles? Selling your own home brew now?
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Of course not! You know, Klee, the wind isn't the only form that the Anemo Archon can turn into. He can turn into anything! So today, he must've come back looking like something else!
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Sure! Jumpy Dumpty it is! Hope you're listening, Anemo Archon!
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: We've all done a lot of talking. Let's go get something to drink, shall we?
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 qin 01.ogg Jean: Dear friends, let us now open the wines.
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 razor 01.ogg Razor: Ahh, green bard.
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 razor 02.ogg Razor: To the Anemo Archon...
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 razor 03.ogg Razor: Don't feel sad, Klee.
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 razor 04.ogg Razor: Yes.
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 razor 05.ogg Razor: I talked a lot with you all, and I learned a lot.
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 razor 06.ogg Razor: Now, I am not afraid.
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 razor 07.ogg Razor: I think that is a blessing.
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 razor 08.ogg Razor: Yes. We share together, and we remember together.
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 razor 09.ogg Razor: Okay, everyone, let's go.
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 together 01.ogg Crowd: To the Anemo Archon!
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 venti 01.ogg Venti: Ahem... Everyone, I am greatly honored to be able to be here today. I have been invited by Acting Grand Master Jean of the Knights of Favonius to perform a piece for everyone: "Thousand-Wind Wine."
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 venti 02.ogg Venti: It is some of the finest verse I know. I dedicate it to the wind, and to everyone here with us today:
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 venti 03.ogg Venti:
"Fill up the barrels and store them away,Then wait, wait for a windier day.Wax the bottles, seal them tight,For the south wind that soothes, for the north wind that bites."
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 venti 04.ogg Venti:
"How does this fine wine taste to the tongue?As 'Mondstadt' to the ear: like a sweet dream of freedom.And what are the fruits that went into the brew?An explorer's courage, a love tender and true."
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 venti 05.ogg Venti:
"A defender's will, strong as yesteryear,Joining the thousand winds in a song of good cheer,Turning sour into sweet, bitter notes fade away,As we wait, wait for a windier day."
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 venti 06.ogg Venti:
"Pray tell, what treasure does this barrel hold?'Tis wheat's greatest triumph, the true liquid gold.As it flows from the keg, what sound drifts by?Wind chimes in the boundless, immemorial sky."
Media:vo jnjeq003 6 venti 07.ogg Venti:
"We raise up our glasses, and voices in song,As we wait, wait for the wind to sing along.Where do we turn once the thousand winds take flight?To the tales of the lyre, to the sweet dream of tonight."
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: So, what do you think of the Weinlesefest? Have you enjoyed yourself?
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 02b 1.ogg Diluc: Sure. We'll talk when you're free.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Well, what would you like to know?
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04a 1.ogg Diluc: *sigh* I can sympathize with the anguish of being away from family.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04a 2.ogg Diluc: Certainly, a tragic situation. But tragedy can also drive personal growth, and perhaps learning how to face it head-on is part of growing up... part of becoming an adult.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04a 3.ogg Diluc: Having the support of some good friends will certainly make that journey easier.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04b 1.ogg Diluc: ...When I unsealed the wine, it seemed that the words of my late father were sealed inside.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04b 2.ogg Diluc: I wonder what he would think if he were to see me now.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04b 3.ogg Diluc: Somehow, I doubt he'd share the same view as he did back then.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04b 4.ogg Diluc: Heh...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04b 5.ogg Diluc: If you say so.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04c 1.ogg Diluc: To the people of Mondstadt, wine-making is a way of working through emotions, and remembering our history.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04c 2.ogg Diluc: We're only able to make such high-quality wines these days thanks to the peace we enjoy. War is a thing of the distant past.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04c 3.ogg Diluc: Even though you might not see me reveling with the crowds, I am grateful for this as much as anyone.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04c 4.ogg Diluc: Say, have you tried our latest product, "Fruits of the Festival"?
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04c 5.ogg Diluc: If you have any thoughts on how it could be improved, I'm all ears.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 04.ogg Lisa: Ah, I'm much more suited to leisurely days like these...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 05b 1.ogg Lisa: Alright, but remember, it's important to rest when you're feeling tired. It makes my heart ache to see you so busy all the time.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 06.ogg Lisa: I'd love to, cutie. Hmm, too bad I can't offer you some tea.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07a 1.ogg Lisa: I was quite surprised to learn that the Grand Master had written a private message just for me.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07a 2.ogg Lisa: And I was equally surprised to find out that Razor's been on his mind this whole time.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07a 3.ogg Lisa: Especially given how demanding he is of Jean... He left her to figure out the whole Weinlesefest on her own, and didn't give her a single word of acknowledgment.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07a 4.ogg Lisa: I'll have to have to a stern word with him on Jean's behalf when he returns.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 1.ogg Lisa: It's funny — I always thought the Grand Master was the one who gave him the name "Razor"...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 2.ogg Lisa: But it turns out his birth parents chose it all along.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 3.ogg Lisa: ...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 4.ogg Lisa: Anyway, Razor told me he heard the voices of his parents during the festival.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 5.ogg Lisa: "Like stepping on a rock in the sun. Warm, but also heavy."
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 6.ogg Lisa: I'm sure he must think of them as both kind and dauntless people...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07c 1.ogg Lisa: Originally, I only planned on having a glass or two. I thought I deserved a treat after being such a good teacher recently.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07c 2.ogg Lisa: But that was before I came to appreciate how truly exceptional the festival-exclusive vintage was...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07c 3.ogg Lisa: Before I knew it, I was already rather tipsy, hehe...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07c 4.ogg Lisa: I'm a bad example. Don't be like me, cutie.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 03.ogg Razor: The wind is gentle, comfortable.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 04b 1.ogg Razor: Okay. You go enjoy the wind.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 05.ogg Razor: Yes.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06a 1.ogg Razor: The message in the letter... I want to thank him.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06a 2.ogg Razor: ...I miss him. Lupical miss him, too.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06a 3.ogg Razor: Now, I am grown up.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06a 4.ogg Razor: I want to hear him talk about human father and mother.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06b 1.ogg Razor: Their voices. I heard them.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06b 2.ogg Razor: Human father and mother... were adventurers...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06b 3.ogg Razor: Teacher said, maybe they didn't survive...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06b 4.ogg Razor: I have a wooden box. Inside are treasures from my friends.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06b 5.ogg Razor: They are, most precious things I own.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06b 6.ogg Razor: ...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06b 7.ogg Razor: Inside box from human father and mother... is all about me...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06c 1.ogg Razor: A long time ago, I thought I was alone. Only have lupical.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06c 2.ogg Razor: Now, I know many people.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06c 3.ogg Razor: Everyone helps me. I will help everyone, too.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06c 4.ogg Razor: Humans, wolves, everyone.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 razor 07.ogg Razor: I am the bridge between city and outside.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 01.ogg Rosaria: (Traveler), hello again...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 02b 1.ogg Rosaria: Alright. But don't tell anyone else that I'm here. I don't want to have to move anytime soon.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 03.ogg Rosaria: Sure. Did you have something you wanted to ask me about?
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04a 1.ogg Rosaria: Oh. Yes, I read his letter. Barbara showed it to me.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04a 2.ogg Rosaria: She'd been so worried about her father, Seamus. She almost burst into tears when she read that "the expedition is safe and all of its members are accounted for."
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04a 3.ogg Rosaria: Hmm? ...My thoughts?
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04a 4.ogg Rosaria: Hehe... You're curious what he means to me as a father figure, is that right? Well, I guess I'm not like other daughters. I can't bring myself to worry about him.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04a 5.ogg Rosaria: He wouldn't be leading that many people if he didn't have the necessary strength and courage for it. He's not the kind of person you need to worry about.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04b 1.ogg Rosaria: So, he's finally come to terms with everything?
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04b 2.ogg Rosaria: Hmm, sounds like he still has some way to go before he can say he's fully independent. But everyone goes through their own life in their own way.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04b 3.ogg Rosaria: Well done. It sounds like your efforts were all worth it in the end.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04c 1.ogg Rosaria: I thought that if I made it to the Weinlesefest, I'd have the chance to spend a whole day in the tavern. Turns out, there's actually more work during a festival than usual.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04c 2.ogg Rosaria: I managed to escape to here, but I still can't completely let my guard down. Who knows when Victoria or Dahlia might show up and drag me off to the sung poetry event.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04c 3.ogg Rosaria: *sigh* The sooner this festival is over, the better.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Hi there, are you here to take a look at my stall? I have a lot of newly developed research products.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 02b 1.ogg Sucrose: Oh, sure. No problem.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Um, okay, go ahead...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04a 1.ogg Sucrose: Oh, this?
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04a 2.ogg Sucrose: I actually wrote out all the nutritional information and prices for my Bio-Alchemy products in advance. But the customers still prefer to ask directly...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04a 3.ogg Sucrose: So... I just read off the sheet for them...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04a 4.ogg Sucrose: Running a stall is a huge challenge for me.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04a 5.ogg Sucrose: Maybe I could get Noelle to interact with the customers, and I do the rest... Mmm, no, never mind... She's probably busy enough already.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04b 1.ogg Sucrose: I have here the Iota-Series Rapid-Acting Deep Freeze Mist Flower, the Theta-Series Fragrance-Enhanced Sweet Flower, Variation 21...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04b 2.ogg Sucrose: And the Epsilon-Series Tetrasweet Sunsettia, Variation 63. I'm proud to put my name to all of these products!
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04b 3.ogg Sucrose: You won't need me to read out all the details, right?
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04c 1.ogg Sucrose: I'm sorry for running off back then...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04c 2.ogg Sucrose: I just thought that you and Noelle would do a better job of expressing things than I could...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04c 3.ogg Sucrose: Did everything work out in the end? Mixing the Epsilon-Series Tetrasweet Sunsettia, Variation 63 with the other ingredients didn't cause any problems, did it?
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04c 4.ogg Sucrose: Oh, and uh... how did things go with Razor...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04c 5.ogg Sucrose: Phew... Thank goodness.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04c 6.ogg Sucrose: Then... can I ask you for a favor? I want to make a note of the full recipe for the Thousand-Wind Wine we made.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 sucrose 04c 7.ogg Sucrose: That way, we'll be able to recreate the exact same flavor we did today in the future, no matter how many years go by.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 01.ogg Venti: I didn't expect you to come by here. Unless... oh, were you following the fragrance of wine on the wind?
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 02b 1.ogg Venti: Then go, my friend. The stories that unfolded here shall be remembered by the wind in the form of verse.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 03.ogg Venti: Sure, the sound of your voice is always a pleasure to hear.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04a 1.ogg Venti: Blessings? Oh, that.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04a 2.ogg Venti: Between you and me... I breathed a sigh of relief when nobody said their wishes out loud during the toast. That would've really put me in a tough spot. Hahaha... The Anemo Archon, Barbatos, doesn't have unlimited power, you know.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04a 3.ogg Venti: I had to take a really deep breath to get the winds of the far-flung past blowing. I nearly went blue in the face.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 1.ogg Venti: He's grown up so much recently... It's such a joy to see.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 2.ogg Venti: Huh... Suddenly I sound just like an old grandpa.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 3.ogg Venti: He was lucky to have friends like you ready to support him through all this.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 4.ogg Venti: I see a kind, gentle soul, with a healthy dose of romance and freedom, too... In other words, a true Mondstadter, who grew up drinking the water of Cider Lake.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 5.ogg Venti: You, on the other hand... Don't worry, you're the gentlest soul I've ever met.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04c 1.ogg Venti: Oh, I've been very busy on that front. I'd long since drunk my fill by Windcoming Day.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04c 2.ogg Venti: But, uh, I wasn't counting on everyone bringing out their finest vintage to welcome me.
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04c 3.ogg Venti: Ah, the fragrance alone was so intoxicating... I had no choice but to make room for a few more rounds...
Media:vo jnjeq004 1 venti 05.ogg Venti: Full disclosure — I also secretly hid two bottles away for myself at the end.
No matter the drink, as long as the mixing is in her hands, it will be unimaginably delicious.

Perhaps it is because Sucrose channels most of her energy into her experiments and research that she comes off as a bit shy in social situations.
Razor's Father: After all the time we spent on it
Razor's Father: An adventurer's name
Razor's Father: I like it
Razor's Father: May as well leave it for our son
Razor's Father: Ooh!
Razor's Father: The wine still isn't ready
Razor's Father: Yes
Razor's Mother: "Razor"
Razor's Mother: What do you think of that name?
Razor: Klee
