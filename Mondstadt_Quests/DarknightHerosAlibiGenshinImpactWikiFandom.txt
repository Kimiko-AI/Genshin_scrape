 ...
 Can I start a tab?
Media:vo dlclq003 12 diluc 04b.ogg Diluc: Apologies, we do not give credit here.
 Do you have any ideas?
 I also forgot to bring mine.
Media:vo dlclq003 12 diluc 04a.ogg Diluc: Then I must regretfully ask you to come back when you can pay.
 I just did some squats.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 huffman 04b.ogg Huffman: Is thats so? But why now of all times, for the love of Barbatos...
 If the price is right.
Media:vo dlclq003 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Hey! Don't be so cheeky!
 No, it's just really warm in here.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 huffman 04a.ogg Huffman: Is it...? But if that's the case, why are you also out of breath?
 Quest DescriptionKnight Huffman has informed you that the Abyss Order is plotting against the Darknight Hero. As a precaution, the Knights have decided to monitor the Darknight Hero's actions. You shared this information with Diluc and discussed countermeasures. Having made your preparations, you now lie in wait for both the Knights and the Abyss Order to act.
 Steer clear of the tavern, for starters.
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 05a.ogg Diluc: That won't work. It will only arouse the Knights' suspicion if I don't show up as they're expecting.
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 05a 1.ogg Diluc: That's what Kaeya is counting on.
Media:vo dlclq003 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm... so what are we gonna do?
 Sure.
(After placing the bait, various slimes appear in the distance)
(Inside the tavern)
(Slimes start approaching)
???: *squelch squelch*
Media:vo dialog dlclq003 connor 01.ogg Connor: The method for obtaining mist flower extract is kind of my own invention. So please, keep it a secret until I've managed to publish it.
Media:vo dialog dlclq003 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: In Mondstadt, Mist Flowers are most commonly found in a region just northwest of the winery.
Media:vo dialog dlclq003 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: Hmm? You'd better get on with it, I can't wait all evening.
Media:vo dialog dlclq003 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Let's discuss the plan some more after we've dealt with these slimes.
Media:vo dialog dlclq003 huffman 01.ogg Huffman: It's only a couple of fruit juices, really, let me get them for you.
Media:vo dlclq002 5 connor 01.ogg Connor: So many Mist Flowers... Great! I can't wait to see how this turns out!
Media:vo dlclq002 5 connor 02.ogg Connor: Oh my... my goodness, the winery owner himself is addressing me directly!
Media:vo dlclq002 5 connor 03.ogg Connor: Don't worry, sir! It is always my honor to serve you, even if it means risking my life!
Media:vo dlclq002 5 connor 04.ogg Connor: Please excuse me — I must get to work!
Media:vo dlclq002 5 connor 05.ogg Connor: Ah... C—Cold... so c—cold... Master Diluc, purification complete, sir! B—But the equipment is...
Media:vo dlclq003 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Let's wait until evening to meet Master Diluc at the tavern.
Media:vo dlclq003 12 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Greetings, Mr. Huffman of the Knights of Favonius. To what do I owe the pleasure at this hour?
Media:vo dlclq003 12 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: What would you like to drink?
Media:vo dlclq003 12 diluc 04a.ogg Diluc: Then I must regretfully ask you to come back when you can pay.
Media:vo dlclq003 12 diluc 04b.ogg Diluc: Apologies, we do not give credit here.
Media:vo dlclq003 12 huffman 01.ogg Huffman: ...Oh, erm, nothing... I'm merely procrastinating. I thought I might indulge myself with a beverage or two.
Media:vo dlclq003 12 huffman 02.ogg Huffman: Ah, Traveler! Fancy meeting you here.
Media:vo dlclq003 12 huffman 03.ogg Huffman: I'll have a Dandelion Wine, I suppose.
Media:vo dlclq003 12 huffman 04.ogg Huffman: Well in that case... let this be my treat.
Media:vo dlclq003 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh, we were in the mood for an evening stroll.
Media:vo dlclq003 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ooh, Paimon wants apple juice!
(Paimon and Diluc nod their heads at each other)
Media:vo dlclq003 12 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: ...Aw, but Paimon forgot to bring her coin pouch! (Traveler), do you have any Mora on you?
Media:vo dlclq003 12 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: No need! We'll be back in a jiffy~
Media:vo dlclq003 12 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huffman showed up, just as expected.
Media:vo dlclq003 12 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Okay, remember the plan? Go to the city's side gate and place the Elemental Bait.
Media:vo dlclq003 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa~ You used all of it... This is gonna be pretty epic.
Media:vo dlclq003 13 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yikes, here come the slimes... Quick, let's get to the tavern before anyone spots us.
Media:vo dlclq003 15 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: One moment.
Media:vo dlclq003 15 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: Oh? The matter of your Dandelion Wine?
Media:vo dlclq003 15 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Hmph. So this is how the Knights of Favonius conduct themselves in a crisis.
Media:vo dlclq003 15 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: The Abyss Order is encroaching on the city gates, and your response is to sit here... drinking wine?
Media:vo dlclq003 15 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: It's like I've always said. The Knights are not to be trusted.
Media:vo dlclq003 15 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: Good. That's him out of the way.
Media:vo dlclq003 15 diluc 07.ogg Diluc: I must get going too. I won't have a second to spare if I'm to be back in time.
Media:vo dlclq003 15 guy 01.ogg City Gate Guard (Guy): Mr. Huffman, Mr. Huffman! A situation at the side gate! Everyone to the side gate!
Media:vo dlclq003 15 guy 02.ogg City Gate Guard: It's... Slimes, Mr. Huffman.
Media:vo dlclq003 15 guy 03.ogg City Gate Guard: We do, but... Sir, there are more slimes out there now than all the slimes I've seen in my life added together!
Media:vo dlclq003 15 huffman 01.ogg Huffman: ...Captain Kaeya is no doubt a formidable knight, but he also brings us more than his share of hassle...
Media:vo dlclq003 15 huffman 02.ogg Huffman: No, this isn't right. I should not be talking about my superior in such a manner. If he were to overhear me...
Media:vo dlclq003 15 huffman 03.ogg Huffman: What is it? What happened?
Media:vo dlclq003 15 huffman 04.ogg Huffman: Slimes? You see them all the time, what's the big panic?
Media:vo dlclq003 15 huffman 05.ogg Huffman: Surely this couldn't be the Abyss Order's secret weapon...
Media:vo dlclq003 15 huffman 06.ogg Huffman: But... I have another matter to attend to here—
Media:vo dlclq003 15 huffman 07.ogg Huffman: N—No, I... That's not what I meant...
Media:vo dlclq003 15 huffman 08.ogg Huffman: I...
Media:vo dlclq003 15 huffman 09.ogg Huffman: *sigh* Master Diluc is right, my conduct here has been below par.
Media:vo dlclq003 15 huffman 10.ogg Huffman: I shall set off at once. But first...
Media:vo dlclq003 15 huffman 11.ogg Huffman: (Traveler), may I have a quiet word?
(Privately)
Media:vo dlclq003 15 huffman 12.ogg Huffman: Shh, keep your voice down. I presume you know what this is about. Please watch Diluc for me — do not let him leave under any circumstances!
Media:vo dlclq003 15 huffman 13.ogg Huffman: I must head to the side gate, but I'll be back shortly. I'm counting on you!
(Huffman goes fend off the slimes)
Media:vo dlclq003 15 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We're back! Is my apple juice ready?
Media:vo dlclq003 15 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ahh... Whoa...
Media:vo dlclq003 15 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh?
Media:vo dlclq003 15 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Everything's going according to plan!
Media:vo dlclq003 16 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: The knights are going to spot you if you go any further. Come on. Let's head to the front gate and get ready for battle.
Media:vo dlclq003 18 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Nothing more than a few hilichurls.
Media:vo dlclq003 18 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: No time to chat. I don't know how long those slimes will keep Huffman occupied. Best get back to the tavern.
Media:vo dlclq003 18 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Classic Master Diluc — not a baddie left standing.
Media:vo dlclq003 18 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whew, glad that's settled! Let's get back to the tavern — You think Huffman is back yet?
Media:vo dlclq003 18 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ahem, where do you think you're going? We need to get back right away!
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Yes... about Kaeya...
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: I should have known he would see this as the perfect opportunity to get back at me.
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: I shan't get into that now. More importantly, the Knights of Favonius are responding more or less as I had anticipated.
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: All we need to do now is think of a counter plan.
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 05a 1.ogg Diluc: That's what Kaeya is counting on.
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 05a.ogg Diluc: That won't work. It will only arouse the Knights' suspicion if I don't show up as they're expecting.
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: Patience. Let me think for a moment...
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 07.ogg Diluc: ...
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 08.ogg Diluc: If they intend to monitor me, then so be it.
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 09.ogg Diluc: We can use this to create the perfect alibi.
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 10.ogg Diluc: If you want to find out, maybe you can do me a small favor first.
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 11.ogg Diluc: In Mondstadt, Mist Flowers are most commonly found in a region just northwest of the winery.
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 12.ogg Diluc: If you could gather some for me, I'd be most grateful. I will make other preparations here in the meantime.
Media:vo dlclq003 2 diluc 13.ogg Diluc: Once you've gathered enough Mist Flowers, I will discuss the plan further with you.
Media:vo dlclq003 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Master Diluc! Paimon has something important to tell you—
Media:vo dlclq003 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Sounds like there's a bit of bad blood between you guys then?
Media:vo dlclq003 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm... so what are we gonna do?
Media:vo dlclq003 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: What's an alabla— an alibi?
Media:vo dlclq003 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh come on! Why do you love cliff hangers so much?
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: It seems Huffman hasn't yet returned.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: We made it in time.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: That is a surprise.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: Perhaps the Knights' true calling is to be slime exterminators. Who knows, domestic pest control may turn out to be a more valuable use of your resources.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: Mr. Huffman, your Dandelion Wine.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: You ought to get back after this. Send my regards to the rest of the Knights.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 07.ogg Diluc: I foresaw this eventuality...
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 08.ogg Diluc: ...So all the guests here tonight, save you two, are my own people from the Dawn Winery.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 09.ogg Diluc: Hmph...
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 10.ogg Diluc: So? You plan to report everything to the Knights of Favonius?
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 11.ogg Diluc: I have nothing to prove to you.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 12.ogg Diluc: Sorry, we're closing. Please see yourselves out.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 13.ogg Diluc: It had better be the very last thing.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 14.ogg Diluc: ...
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 15.ogg Diluc: Don't mind him.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 16.ogg Diluc: Thank you for all your help with this matter. This is a token of my gratitude.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 17.ogg Diluc: I'm in the habit of working alone, but I did enjoy having your assistance this time.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 diluc 18.ogg Diluc: In the future, if there's anything you ever need, you can come to me for help.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 huffman 01.ogg Huffman: *panting* ...The situation is sorted now. I never expected that the Abyss Order's army would turn out to be nothing more than a few slimes.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 huffman 02.ogg Huffman: Master Diluc, please, have you no respect at all...
Media:vo dlclq003 20 huffman 03.ogg Huffman: (Traveler), how come you're sweating so much? You didn't leave, did you?
Media:vo dlclq003 20 huffman 04a.ogg Huffman: Is it...? But if that's the case, why are you also out of breath?
Media:vo dlclq003 20 huffman 04b.ogg Huffman: Is thats so? But why now of all times, for the love of Barbatos...
Media:vo dlclq003 20 huffman 05.ogg Huffman: Hmm...
Media:vo dlclq003 20 huffman 06.ogg Huffman: Excuse me, sir. Might I be so bold as to inquire...
Media:vo dlclq003 20 huffman 07.ogg Huffman: ...Did you see Master Diluc— I mean, today's bartender... Did you see him leave just now?
Media:vo dlclq003 20 huffman 08.ogg Huffman: I see...
Media:vo dlclq003 20 huffman 09.ogg Huffman: Oh... Never mind, I must be going, I should report back. Here, take this as a token of my esteem.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 huffman 10.ogg Huffman: Hmm... How odd...
(Huffman mumbles as he leaves the tavern)
Media:vo dlclq003 20 jiuke 01.ogg Patrons: Master Diluc? Why no, he's been behind the bar this entire time.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Not all of them... Or should I say, not all of us.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: I just picked a good spot to quietly sit and watch the show.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Correct. "The Darknight Hero's Alibi"... I think it's my favorite chapter so far. More intriguing than a fine wine.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Haha... Come now Diluc, you know me better than that. I have no interest in exposing secrets.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: I was just curious to see how far Mondstadt's Darknight Hero would really go.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: And you did not disappoint.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Oh, naturally.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: I must say though, one thing I didn't see coming is that the mighty Darknight Hero would actually need help from other people...
Media:vo dlclq003 20 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Alright, alright... I have no further need of wine to entertain myself tonight, in any case.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: Just one last thing before I go.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: I feel strangely comforted by the fact you now have an assistant, Diluc.
Media:vo dlclq003 20 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: I hope you all a wonderful night.
(Kaeya leaves)
Media:vo dlclq003 20 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh, Huffman is getting suspicious!
Media:vo dlclq003 20 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yikes! He's asking other customers... We're done for!
Media:vo dlclq003 20 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Phew! That was too close! Paimon was sure we were toast...
Media:vo dlclq003 20 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: They're all in on it?
Media:vo dlclq003 20 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Kaeya!? Where did you come from?
Media:vo dlclq003 20 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Whaaa... You've been here this whole time!?
Media:vo dlclq003 20 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: What was all that about?
Media:vo dlclq003 20 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Woooow! Thanks Master Diluc!
Media:vo dlclq003 5 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Ah, you're back.
Media:vo dlclq003 5 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: Allow me to introduce the winery's master brewer—
Media:vo dlclq003 5 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: So, are you certain the equipment can withstand this level of purity?
Media:vo dlclq003 5 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: Long story short...
Media:vo dlclq003 5 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: A few days ago, the winery was experimenting with some new flavors. They wanted to see if Mist Flower can truly add a crisp and refreshing taste.
Media:vo dlclq003 5 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: Sure enough, they discovered that the flower's extract is truly potent.
Media:vo dlclq003 5 diluc 07.ogg Diluc: No, not potent in terms of attracting customers, but slimes.
Media:vo dlclq003 5 diluc 08.ogg Diluc: Slimes need to extract elemental energy to survive... For them, this substance is simply irresistible.
Media:vo dlclq003 5 diluc 09.ogg Diluc: So I thought to myself, "I wonder how much trouble I could cause now that I know this..."
Media:vo dlclq003 5 diluc 10.ogg Diluc: Marvelous work. Don't fret about the equipment, I shall have my butler order more immediately.
Media:vo dlclq003 5 diluc 11.ogg Diluc: This is what I was talking about.
Media:vo dlclq003 5 diluc 12.ogg Diluc: Mist Flower extract... or for our purposes, "Elemental Bait."
Media:vo dlclq003 5 diluc 13.ogg Diluc: Sprinkle a little on the ground over there — careful, just a small amount.
Media:vo dlclq003 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? What's so life-threatening about this?
Media:vo dlclq003 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What's he gonna do with a bunch of Mist Flowers?
Media:vo dlclq003 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So the new batch is selling like hot cakes?
Media:vo dlclq003 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Yikes! What was that noise?
Media:vo dlclq003 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: "Marvelous! Jolly-ho! Spiffing! Somebody fetch the butler!" Paimon never knew you had to be so well-spoken to get a job in the alcohol industry.
Media:vo dlclq003 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Wow, it really has a strong elemental... whiff! Can we test it out?
Media:vo dlclq003 7 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: It appears the potency is greater than anticipated...
Media:vo dlclq003 7 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: We'd better get rid of them before they wreak havoc on the manor.
Media:vo dlclq003 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: And then? That's it?
Media:vo dlclq003 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: How long does it take before...
Media:vo dlclq003 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Holy moley, it really does attract slimes! ...And even more than we expected...
Media:vo dlclq003 9 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Yes. The plan is...
(Fastforward the explanation)
Media:vo dlclq003 9 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: ...and so I expect it to all go down without a hitch.
Media:vo dlclq003 9 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: I have persevered alone from the start.
Media:vo dlclq003 9 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: Now, I alone must face what lies ahead.
Media:vo dlclq003 9 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: I am indeed indebted to you. I shall see you at the tavern, as per the plan.
Media:vo dlclq003 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whew... Such a powerful effect from such a small amount of extract. At least we didn't go picking wild flowers for nothing.
Media:vo dlclq003 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Alright! So can you tell us what your plan is now, Master Diluc?
Media:vo dlclq003 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Are you sure it will work?
Media:vo dlclq003 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: You're the only person in the plan...
Media:vo dlclq003 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Well... if you already made up your mind...
Media:vo dlclq003 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: But until that moment comes, Traveler and Paimon can still help you out where we can. Isn't that right, (Traveler)?
Media:vo dlclq003 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Hey! Don't be so cheeky!
Media:vo dlclq003 cs diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Ah. There you are.
Media:vo dlclq003 cs diluc 02.ogg Diluc: Dealing with you will be the easy part.
(Diluc fights off all the incoming hilichurls and Abyss Mages)
Refining: *bang crash wallop*...
