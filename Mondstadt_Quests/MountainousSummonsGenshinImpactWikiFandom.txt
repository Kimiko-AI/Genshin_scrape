 Can't hurt to lend you my ears.
 I'll consider it.
 Now, I wouldn't claim to be that strong...
 Quest DescriptionThe hilichurls of Dadaupa Gorge have grown unusually active. The Adventurers' Guild's scholar-adventurer, Dr. Livingstone, is currently investigating the Gorge. Perhaps you can lend her some help.
 Well, what's the matter, then?
Dr. Livingstone: As I've mentioned before, I still have further research that I intend to conduct in this area. But the whole gorge is all a-bustle these days due to this tournament, which has disrupted my progress.
Dr. Livingstone: Dadaupa Gorge is sacred to the hilichurls, and strong fighters are gathering from every corner of the continent to this place.
Dr. Livingstone: Do you remember the Meaty Tribe's arena? Lately, it seems like some sort of no-holds-barred fighting tournament is being held around there.
Dr. Livingstone: I'll do my best to support you, for my part. Ad astra abyssosque!
Dr. Livingstone: I'm sure that it would interest and adventurer as wise, strong, and disposed to action as you are.
Dr. Livingstone: I'm sure that the desire to be the strongest in Teyvat has crossed everyone's minds at some point, right? It seems hilichurls are no exception.
Dr. Livingstone: It's something that might seem troublesome, but is in fact pretty interesting.
Dr. Livingstone: Still, the idea of a no-holds-barred tournament is a rather intriguing one, don't you think?
Dr. Livingstone: The sooner you win the tournament, the sooner I can get back to work. It's a win-win!
Dr. Livingstone: We meet again, Traveler!
Dr. Livingstone: What I'm trying to say is: You once conquered the Meaty Tribe's arena. Why don't you give the tournament a whirl?
Paimon: Huh, you seem to be in pretty high spirits, Dr. Livingstone. Did something good happen?
Paimon: Iâ€”Intriguing?
