Media:vo jyeq001 2 georg 04.ogg Georg: Look, I know we've had a great harvest this year and our production costs have gone down a fair amount, but even then... I'm afraid this price is just not doable.

Media:vo jyeq001 2 georg 05.ogg Georg: Sounds good to me, that's around the same price we've agreed in previous years, too. We have a deal!

Media:vo jyeq001 2 georg 06.ogg Georg: Hmm... A little lower than I was hoping for. But he's a reliable customer. I think I can make it work.

Media:vo jyeq001 2 georg 07.ogg Georg: I'm sorry, but I just can't consider going that low. If you're serious about placing an order, please, just take my price.
 "Rescue"?
 About how to prepare the funds...
Bernhard: You could help nearby customers place orders with the wine merchants or supply winemakers with ingredients...
Bernhard: Either method is fine, so you can just prioritize based on your preference.
 About the person in charge being appointed through draws...
Bernhard: Well... The person in charge was determined by a random draw mechanism that was intended to give each Knight an equal chance... to facilitate dialogue between us and the public...
Bernhard: I can do my usual work just fine. But when it comes to deciding on a direction or coming up with a plan, I'm always afraid that I'll make a mess of things...
Bernhard: So, it's a good thing that you, our Honorary Knight, have stepped up to the plate! You could say that you saved this charity event — not to mention me!
 As Paimon says, we are happy to help.
 Everyone has things that they struggle with.
 Go do what you have to do, it's alright.
 Happy Weinlesefest!
 Hi, Barbara.
 I understand.
 I wish I could have been there to hear it.
 Let me give it a try first!
Bernhard: Okay! I'm looking forward to hearing the good news from you.
 Quest DescriptionBernhard, a Knight of Favonius, appears to have encountered some trouble this Weinlesefest...
 Sounds like a lot of effort...
 Thanks for your encouragement!
 We'll take care of the charity event.
 We're pretty good at this.
 What do you need from us?
 Yes, in the main hall of the Knights of Favonius Headquarters.
 You have so much on your plate already.
Bernhard: Either method is fine, so you can just prioritize based on your preference.
Bernhard: I can do my usual work just fine. But when it comes to deciding on a direction or coming up with a plan, I'm always afraid that I'll make a mess of things...
Bernhard: I'll take care of the shop's set-up. You two can focus on preparing the necessary funds!
Bernhard: Okay! I'm looking forward to hearing the good news from you.
Bernhard: So, it's a good thing that you, our Honorary Knight, have stepped up to the plate! You could say that you saved this charity event — not to mention me!
Bernhard: Well... The person in charge was determined by a random draw mechanism that was intended to give each Knight an equal chance... to facilitate dialogue between us and the public...
Bernhard: You could help nearby customers place orders with the wine merchants or supply winemakers with ingredients...
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 01.ogg Bernhard: Wait! Honorary Knight! And Paimon, the best guide in Teyvat!
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 02.ogg Bernhard: I humbly beg for your assistance!
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 03.ogg Bernhard: That's right. I am Bernhard, a member of the Logistics Company under Captain Hertha.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 04.ogg Bernhard: Normally, I would hope to become better acquainted before asking for a favor like this... but time's running out, so I really have no choice.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 05.ogg Bernhard: Please help me rescue the charity event!
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 06.ogg Bernhard: Well, the Knights of Favonius wants to run a stall during the festival...
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 07.ogg Bernhard: The idea is for all profits from the sales to go to charity. Specifically, the funds will provide support to disadvantaged children and elderly citizens.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 08.ogg Bernhard: We drew lots to decide whose job it would be, and as it happened... I was the lucky winner. I really didn't want to screw this up, so I asked all around for advice, but...
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 09.ogg Bernhard: My experience is in inventory and shipping. Now I'm supposed to run a whole shop, but it took me forever just to think of what to sell... I'm already completely out of my depth.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 10.ogg Bernhard: And that is why I humbly beseech you to render your assistance...
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 11.ogg Bernhard: Oh, I can't thank you enough! Right, let me get down to brass tacks...
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 12.ogg Bernhard: Before we can open shop, we need to amass a supply of Fairbrew Jellies. This is the basic currency that we will use when running the stall.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 13.ogg Bernhard: The wine merchants in the area are in dire need of raw ingredients for wine-making. Sell them raw ingredients, and they will pay you generously in Fairbrew Jellies.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 14.ogg Bernhard: Also, there are some international customers looking to purchase beverages in bulk during the Weinlesefest period. They're on the market for an agent to handle their purchase orders.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 15.ogg Bernhard: In the interests of establishing a long-term business relationship, these customers are usually willing to offer a generous price, and there's also room for negotiation with the wine merchants.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 16.ogg Bernhard: The price difference is ours to keep as commission, and you can cash that amount in for Fairbrew Jellies.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 17.ogg Bernhard: R—Really? Well, that's wonderful!
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 18.ogg Bernhard: I have one order here with me already: A Mr. Shevirme from Sumeru wishes to purchase 50 crates of Fruits of the Festival.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 19.ogg Bernhard: These beverages can be bought from the Angel's Share's stand. The shopkeeper's name is Georg.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 20.ogg Bernhard: He's a very nice man, but he won't be pushed around. Please consider the price carefully and try to reach a good deal with Georg.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 21.ogg Bernhard: I should carry on setting up the stall now. Once you've gathered enough Fairbrew Jellies, come back here and we'll take it from there.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 22.ogg Bernhard: You won't need to worry about the supplies for the shop.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 23.ogg Bernhard: I'm already in contact with the suppliers, and they'll send everything over once the funds are in place.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 bernhard 24.ogg Bernhard: This is an enormous help. Thank you both ever so much!

Media:vo jyeq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So, there are a ton of sellers at the Weinlesefest. Should be some pretty cool stuff to check out, right?
Media:vo jyeq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's go and browse while we still have the chance!
Media:vo jyeq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Whoa! Did Paimon hear that right? Is Paimon finally starting to make a name for herself?
Media:vo jyeq001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, wait... haven't we met...?
Media:vo jyeq001 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: The charity event? Oh right, Master Jean mentioned that. So what's happened?
Media:vo jyeq001 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Yeah! Also, no need to be so formal.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: So, you said this is to help out the kids and old folks of Mondstadt, right? Sounds like a great cause!
Media:vo jyeq001 1 paimon 08a.ogg Media:vo jyeq001 1 paimon 08b.ogg Paimon: (Traveler) is an Honorary Knight, and Paimon's a longtime friend of Favonius. We'll be more than happy to do our part.
Media:vo jyeq001 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: So to sum up, our job is to sell ingredients to the wine merchants, and place orders for international customers, making sure to negotiate the price. Right?
Media:vo jyeq001 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Sounds much easier than Paimon imagined!
Media:vo jyeq001 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Alright, sounds good! We'll find the funds and you sort out the shop.
Media:vo jyeq001 2 georg 01.ogg Georg: Oh? Did you say Shevirme? He's a regular customer of mine. Always orders around the same amount each time...
Media:vo jyeq001 2 georg 02.ogg Georg: But I digress — what price are you offering this year?
(A Mood gauge appears starting at a random value of 4.25–4.75 Hearts, and negotiations begin at the default maximum amount of 14,000 Fairbrew Jellies)
Media:vo jyeq001 2 georg 03.ogg Georg: I'm sorry — Did you even speak to Shevirme before deciding on a price? You must be joking, that's much too low.
Media:vo jyeq001 2 georg 04.ogg Georg: Look, I know we've had a great harvest this year and our production costs have gone down a fair amount, but even then... I'm afraid this price is just not doable.
Media:vo jyeq001 2 georg 05.ogg Georg: Sounds good to me, that's around the same price we've agreed in previous years, too. We have a deal!

Media:vo jyeq001 2 georg 07.ogg Georg: I'm sorry, but I just can't consider going that low. If you're serious about placing an order, please, just take my price.
Media:vo jyeq001 2 georg 08.ogg Georg: As usual, I will arrange for someone to deliver the goods directly to Shevirme's place of business.
Media:vo jyeq001 2 georg 09.ogg Georg: You won't have to worry about a thing. Just make sure you keep hold of this receipt.
Media:vo jyeq001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hi there, Georg. We're Shevirme's agents. He's asked us to order 50 crates of Fruits of the Festival for him.
Media:vo jyeq001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Alright, let's keep bringing the funds in. We gotta work quickly if we wanna gather all these Fairbrew Jellies in time!
Media:vo jyeq001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Bernhard says we can approach this however we want, just as long as we raise all the funds we need...
Media:vo jyeq001 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: We get a commission for every order we help place for an international customer. So maybe it's not worth trying to sell loads of ingredients to the wine merchants...
Media:vo jyeq001 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Still... just to make sure we've covered everything, let's take a look at the other wine merchants.

Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: (Traveler), Paimon! You're here!
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Thanks! And happy Weinlesefest to you, too!
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: This festival is one of the most popular ones in Mondstadt. I'm so happy I ran into you guys here. I hope you have a great time!
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: Oh, also, I heard from Georg that you're collecting Fairbrew Jellies?
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: I'm just curious, are you helping out with the Knights of Favonius charity event?
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: Wonderful! Heehee... they're lucky to have you. Now that you've joined the team, I just know it'll be a huge success!
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: I helped out at a small charity sale for the Knights once, too.
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: Although... my only contribution was standing out front and singing...
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: Oh! And I also met the bard, Venti there! He even persuaded me to perform an impromptu song with him...
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: The music he plays is quite refined and elegant. At first, I didn't want to sing too loudly, in case I ruined the style he was going for...
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: But he sang a harmony to guide me in, and before long, we were sounding great.
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: In the end, the audience loved it, and we sold a lot at the event.
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 13.ogg Barbara: Yeah... too bad we couldn't fit it into the schedule this year.
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 14.ogg Barbara: The Church of Favonius wants to hold a sung poetry event somewhere with a nice view during the festival, which means I have to go to rehearsal...
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 15.ogg Barbara: Thank you both! Well, maybe I can't stay here and sing, but I still wanna do a little something to contribute!
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 16.ogg Barbara: I can, um... I can help promote your stall.
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 17.ogg Barbara: Hmm... Should I make some big posters? Or maybe some flyers to hand out?
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 18.ogg Barbara: I'll have to pick a memorable slogan, too! And maybe it'll seem more sincere if I sign them...?
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 19.ogg Barbara: Then again, maybe telling people in person would be more effective...
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 20.ogg Barbara: It's fine, really! It won't take me too long. Now I feel a little embarrassed, heh...
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 21.ogg Barbara: Let me think about it a little more and talk to some other people about their marketing experience! (Traveler), Paimon, I'll see you later~
Media:vo jyeq001 3 barbara 22.ogg Barbara: And, um... the Knights and the Church of Favonius are really proud of you!
Media:vo jyeq001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey! It's Barbara!
Media:vo jyeq001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We sure are! Everybody's gotta do their part, right?
Media:vo jyeq001 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: The stall isn't up and running yet. We're busy raising funds so they can open for business!
Media:vo jyeq001 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: There's sure to be a bunch of other problems to deal with once it's open, but whatever comes up, we'll deal with it!
Media:vo jyeq001 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So Barbara's worked with the Tone-Deaf Bard before...
Media:vo jyeq001 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Yup, sounds like we've each got our own important work to do. Let's give it our all.
Media:vo jyeq001 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Wow, with Barbara helping out on the marketing side, this charity event will get loads more attention!
Media:vo jyeq001 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Aww, thanks! We'll do our best.
Media:vo jyeq001 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Paimon's even more motivated than ever now! (Traveler), we gotta make sure we do a really great job here!
