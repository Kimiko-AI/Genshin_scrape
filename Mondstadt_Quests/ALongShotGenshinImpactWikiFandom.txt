(After defeating Stormterror, the platforms crumble and everyone loses their footing.)

(Dvalin flies over to a circle of platforms, and Diluc, Jean, Venti, and the Traveler follow. Dvalin bursts up from the middle of the platforms to engage the party in battle.)
 Quest DescriptionAfter a long and daring pursuit of Dvalin, who has been led astray by the Abyss Mages, you are about to finally confront him once and for all.
Dvalin: Is this... the power of the Anemo Archon? But I am no longer part of the Four Winds.
Dvalin: Just now... Why... Why did you not ask me to protect you like the last time?
Media:vo mdaq069 2 venti 01.ogg Venti: Look! There are two shiny spots on Dvalin's back!
Media:vo mdaq069 2 venti 02.ogg Venti: They appear to be poisonous blood clots that have coagulated on his wounds...
Media:vo mdaq069 2 venti 03.ogg Venti: The Abyss Order must have cursed the wounds. That's what's corrupting Dvalin's mind.
Media:vo mdaq069 2 venti 04.ogg Venti: To save Dvalin, we're going to have to get rid of those blood clots.
Media:vo mdaq069 2 venti 05.ogg Venti: Aim for those blood clots!
(After reaching roughly 60% HP)
Media:vo mdaq069 2 venti 06.ogg Venti: Dvalin is getting away... but I am familiar with his tactics. Just hold on a bit longer.
Media:vo mdaq069 2 venti 07.ogg Venti: I'll extract and condense the pure Anemo from the shots being fired.
Media:vo mdaq069 2 venti 08.ogg Venti: Shattering them will create acceleration currents.
Media:vo mdaq069 2 venti 09.ogg Venti: I can't control where they will appear, so keep your eyes peeled.
Media:vo mdaq069 2 venti 10.ogg Venti: Shatter the condensed Anemo orbs to create acceleration currents.
Media:vo mdaq069 2 venti 11.ogg Venti: I know it's hard to tell amidst the barrage of bullets, but this is the only way.
(After depleting Dvalin's HP)
Media:vo mdaq069 2 venti 12.ogg Venti: Dvalin... I'm sorry this is hurting you... Hang on, just one more!
Media:vo mdaq069 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: ...This dragon has strange taste when it comes to naming things.
Media:vo mdaq069 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Seriously!?
Media:vo mdaq069 3 venti 01.ogg Venti: Now we can fight Dvalin on equal grounds. The grandest bard is here to help!
Media:vo mdaq069 3 venti 02.ogg Venti: But first, let me be clear...
Media:vo mdaq069 3 venti 03.ogg Venti: Even after hundreds of years without use, Dvalin's teeth and claws are still very dangerous.
Media:vo mdaq069 3 venti 04.ogg Venti: A-ha, this is Dvalin's ace in the hole: Caelestinum Finale Termini!
Media:vo mdaq069 3 venti 05.ogg Venti: I named it for him just now.
Media:vo mdaq069 3 venti 06.ogg Venti: Well... Anyway, let's ride the wind currents and stay away from the breaking platforms.
Media:vo mdaq069 3 venti 07.ogg Venti: The energy flooding out from the fissures will be hot. Be sure to watch your step.
Media:vo mdaq069 3 venti 08.ogg Venti: Now is our chance! Aim for the tainted blood clot on his neck!
Media:vo mdaq071 1 cs qin 01.ogg Jean: And so, the Stormterror threat was quelled.
Media:vo mdaq071 1 cs qin 02.ogg Jean: I clarified the misunderstanding to the citizens of Mondstadt
Media:vo mdaq071 1 cs qin 03.ogg Jean: and let them know that they are safe.
(The Traveler and Paimon, Diluc, and Venti are seen in various parts of the city)
Media:vo mdaq071 1 cs qin 04.ogg Jean: To them it seems Stormterror attacked Mondstadt out of nowhere
Media:vo mdaq071 1 cs qin 05.ogg Jean: and then vanished just as quickly.
Media:vo mdaq071 1 cs qin 06.ogg Jean: They must be finding the whole ordeal very confusing.
Media:vo mdaq071 1 cs venti 01.ogg Venti: However, winds change their course.
Media:vo mdaq071 1 cs venti 02.ogg Venti: Someday, they will blow towards a brighter future.
(Cutscene ends)
Media:vo mdaq071 1 cs venti 03.ogg Venti: Freedom, if demanded of you by an archon, is really no freedom at all.
Media:vo mdaq071 1 cs venti 04.ogg Venti: Even if that's so, you still protected us regardless.
Media:vo mdaq071 1 cs venti 05.ogg Venti: Now, spread your wings of freedom and go with my blessing.
(Dvalin brings everyone back to the City of Mondstadt. The scene cuts to Jean at her office desk.)
One day later...
Paimon: This place is gonna collapse!
(Dvalin rescues everyone from falling and flies away with everyone on his back)
Venti: It's been a while since we flew like this together, huh, Dvalin?
Venti: Me not wanting you to listen to the Abyss Order doesn't mean that you have to listen to me.
