Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 21.ogg Kaeya: These incredibly thrilling adventures are romances that could only be told by pirates.
 Can't say I don't have time...
Media:vo kylq001 1 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Marvelous!
 Eight-headed hydras, silver-haired banshees... Do they really exist?
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 20.ogg Kaeya: The world we live in is fascinating, full of unknown and inexplicable wonders.
 How surprising.
 I never knew you could inherit eye patches.
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: My! (Traveler), how could you not know such common knowledge!
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: This is no different from children inheriting their hairstyle from their parents!
 I'd like to ask...
 Is it really, really true?
 Is it true?
 It's eight-headed hydras and silver-haired banshees...
Media:vo kylq001 4 paimon 04a.ogg Paimon: That's what Paimon said! It's a super epic sword!
Media:vo kylq001 4 paimon 04a 1.ogg Paimon: Anyway, it's fine as long as Paimon doesn't tell them the treasure's location!
 It's not ideal for Kaeya to show his face.
Media:vo kylq001 7 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: That's right. You read my mind.
Media:vo kylq001 7 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: I am a knight... so I shouldn't have any dealing with the black market.
 No. We're here for...
 Quest DescriptionYou bump into Kaeya, whom you first met during Stormterror's attack, at the Knights of Favonius headquarters.
 Tell me about the Arcadian Ruins
 Tell me what happened.
 We'll get the intel back to you.
 We're looking for...
 What's wrong, Kaeya?
 You don't usually lose your chill.
 You've said too much.
Media:vo kylq001 4 paimon 04b.ogg Paimon: It's fine! As long as Paimon doesn't tell them the treasure's location!
???: ...
As the conversation ends, a suspicious character quietly slinks away from the scene...
Media:vo dialog kylq001 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: I am interested in your search, but I just don't have any intel for you.
Media:vo dialog kylq001 jack 01.ogg Jack: Should I go look for it as well? Oh, I'm just joking. I hope you guys find it.
Media:vo dialog kylq001 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: I'm a bit busy right now. Do try to find more... clues... You know what I mean.
Media:vo dialog kylq001 stanley 01.ogg Stanley: If you are not here for my stories, we have nothing to talk about.
Media:vo kylq001 1 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: This is bad... Such a hassle... What am I going to do...
Media:vo kylq001 1 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Oh, thank the Thousand Winds! (Traveler), your arrival must be the grace of the gods!
Media:vo kylq001 1 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: If I may ask — envoy sent by the Anemo God to save this mere mortal — could you spare a moment?
Media:vo kylq001 1 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Marvelous!
Media:vo kylq001 1 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: I cannot let my peers hear about this! I cannot seek help from anyone else but you.
Media:vo kylq001 1 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Please, let us move to somewhere more fit for such conversations...
Media:vo kylq001 1 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Let's talk in the courtyard just outside the headquarters. Come with me.
Media:vo kylq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ewwww, cut it out!
Media:vo kylq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What's with the sneakiness...
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: This place will do.
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: How should I begin... Oh, right, let me tell you a secret first.
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: It's a secret of my past, and I confide in you to keep it.
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: As a matter of fact, my grandfather was a pirate!
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: ...Wait, why do you sound so blithe? Do you think I'm making it up?
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Look at my eye patch! I inherited it from my grandfather and this is solid proof that we are related by blood!
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: My! (Traveler), how could you not know such common knowledge!
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: This is no different from children inheriting their hairstyle from their parents!
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Yesterday I was glancing through the notes my grandfather left and stumbled upon records that spoke of a treasure...
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: According to his notes, the treasure is buried in the "Lost Arcadian Ruins."
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: But the location of the ruins is currently unknown. I've tried searching for clues...
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Hmph! Treasures that consist of nothing but gold and gems are third-rate treasures...
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: My grandfather's treasure is a sword!
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: A magic sword that grants the wielder unrivaled power!
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: The sword was dropped from Celestia into the sea by a god. It was later salvaged by my grandfather's crew by pure coincidence.
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: The moment he gripped the sword, thunder roared, billows hollowed, and the clear skies were suddenly swallowed by raging winds...
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 17.ogg Kaeya: With the might of the magic sword, my grandfather went on to defeat a hydra, a silver-haired banshee, a wicked abyss dragon...
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 18.ogg Kaeya: But the immense power of the sword enticed many more greedy pirates.
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 19.ogg Kaeya: To avoid meaningless conflicts, my grandfather hid the magic sword.
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 20.ogg Kaeya: The world we live in is fascinating, full of unknown and inexplicable wonders.
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 21.ogg Kaeya: These incredibly thrilling adventures are romances that could only be told by pirates.
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 22.ogg Kaeya: A gang of Treasure Hoarders has been very active lately and many ruins have had their relics stolen by them.
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 23.ogg Kaeya: I'm afraid that they will soon discover the Arcadian Ruins and the magic sword will be lost...
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 24.ogg Kaeya: Wow~
Media:vo kylq001 2 kaeya 25.ogg Kaeya: Great! Please keep it a secret. I'll wait for your good news!
Media:vo kylq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Tell us what it's about already!
Media:vo kylq001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Don't worry, Paimon's lips are sealed.
Media:vo kylq001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh.
Media:vo kylq001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: ...Treasure!?
Media:vo kylq001 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Treasure...
Media:vo kylq001 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Treasure!
Media:vo kylq001 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Kaeya! What kind of treasure is it? Gold? Or better yet, gems!?
Media:vo kylq001 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Oh wowwwww!
Media:vo kylq001 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Holy moley! That's just insane!
Media:vo kylq001 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: We won't let it fall into the wrong hands! We must get the sword before them.
Media:vo kylq001 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: You just rest assured that Paimon and (Traveler) are here to help!
Media:vo kylq001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey! So whatcha think, (Traveler)? Isn't it exciting? We're talking about a super-duper powerful sword!
Media:vo kylq001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Well... let's go to the Adventurers' Guild and see if we can find out more.
Media:vo kylq001 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: The adventurers should know more about the ruins, right?
Media:vo kylq001 4 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Arcadian Ruins... Never heard of them.
Media:vo kylq001 4 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Thanks for your intel anyway. If you do find these ruins, I'd love to see them.
Media:vo kylq001 4 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: Hey, kiddo! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild!
Media:vo kylq001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmph! We're not here for something that boring!
Media:vo kylq001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We're looking for a sword that fell from Celestia... One that can kill eight-headed banshees and silver-haired hydras.
Media:vo kylq001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: It's super, mega, uber powerful!
Media:vo kylq001 4 paimon 04a 1.ogg Paimon: Anyway, it's fine as long as Paimon doesn't tell them the treasure's location!
Media:vo kylq001 4 paimon 04a.ogg Paimon: That's what Paimon said! It's a super epic sword!
Media:vo kylq001 4 paimon 04b.ogg Paimon: It's fine! As long as Paimon doesn't tell them the treasure's location!
Media:vo kylq001 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So, Cyrus, do you know where the Lost Arcadian Ruins are supposed to be?
Media:vo kylq001 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Uh... my... intel...?
Media:vo kylq001 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Nope. We just want to know if you've been to the Arcadian Ruins?
Media:vo kylq001 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh? Even the great Stanley doesn't know?
Media:vo kylq001 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We don't have time for your stories. Think hard, please. We need clues.
Media:vo kylq001 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Gosh...
Media:vo kylq001 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: When we find the Arcadian treasure, our story will definitely be better than your stupid stories!
Media:vo kylq001 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hmph! It's a waste of time talking to him. Let's go already.
Media:vo kylq001 5 stanley 02.ogg Stanley: Arcadian Ruins? Imagine that... So there are places that I haven't been to...
Media:vo kylq001 5 stanley 03.ogg Stanley: Never mind this Arcadia... You need to know what happened to me on the Mare Jivari and in the Geyser Realm...
Media:vo kylq001 5 stanley 04.ogg Stanley:The Mare Jivari... It was a place of death...
Media:vo kylq001 5 stanley 05.ogg Stanley: Treasure...? Even Tales too?
Media:vo kylq001 5 stanley 06.ogg Stanley: I'm Stanley. Remember my name. You're also here for my stories, aren't you?
Media:vo kylq001 6 jack 02.ogg Jack: Arcadian... Can't say I've heard of it. Sorry, I'm still new here, so...
Media:vo kylq001 6 jack 03.ogg Jack: But you can try posting a commission and see if there are any adventurers who know about it.
Media:vo kylq001 6 jack 04.ogg Jack: Really!?
Media:vo kylq001 6 jack 05.ogg Jack: Well then, I'll keep a lookout for your treasure — I mean, your Arcadian Ruins.
Media:vo kylq001 6 jack 06.ogg Jack: Hey! Are you a new adventurer? Wanna join my adventure team?
Media:vo kylq001 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey! Do you have any intel on the Arcadian Ruins?
Media:vo kylq001 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Really...
Media:vo kylq001 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: That's a no-no! No way.
Media:vo kylq001 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: We can't afford them beating us to the treasure!
Media:vo kylq001 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Great! Thanks!
Media:vo kylq001 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Still no clues...
Media:vo kylq001 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Well, it's not like it's gonna be easy! Come one, it's the hiding place of the super amazing sword!
Media:vo kylq001 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Anyway, we should go meet up with Kaeya first.
Media:vo kylq001 7 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Oh, you're back. Do you have news for me?
Media:vo kylq001 7 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Haha... That much is expected.
Media:vo kylq001 7 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Oh, I only mean that, what's the fun in finding it without the hard work?
Media:vo kylq001 7 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: However, I do have some clues.
Media:vo kylq001 7 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: I sent someone to collect black market intel. It seems that someone does know about the Arcadian Ruins.
Media:vo kylq001 7 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Now, now, as per the black market's rules, they will send someone to meet us to prevent leaks.
Media:vo kylq001 7 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: We will be meeting the informant at the Whispering Woods.
Media:vo kylq001 7 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: That's right. You read my mind.
Media:vo kylq001 7 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: I am a knight... so I shouldn't have any dealing with the black market.
Media:vo kylq001 7 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: You have my thanks.
Media:vo kylq001 7 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Of course, you'll be compensated for your troubles... by the Knights.
Media:vo kylq001 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Listen, we asked around the Adventurers' Guild and found... Well, nothing.
Media:vo kylq001 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Why is that?
Media:vo kylq001 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Really? Where's the guy?
Media:vo kylq001 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Then, what are we waiting for?
Media:vo kylq001 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Ooh, no problemo!
