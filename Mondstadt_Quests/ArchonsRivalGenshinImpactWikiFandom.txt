 But aren't we the real thieves here?
 But why would they do that?
 Certainly seems like Treasure Hoarders.
 Have a look.
 I remember hearing more about their activities recently too...
 I wonder if we should feel sorry for them...
 I wouldn't do something like that.
 No wonder they've set their sights on this sword.
 Perhaps this is their fate?
 Quest DescriptionAs Albedo expected, this sword can absorb the power to display a facsimile of "growth." This rare ability has caused it to catch the eye of certain parties with ulterior motives.
 That's probably not how the Treasure Hoarders see things...
 The sword's power has increased.
 There are different responses... but there is an identical flow of energy.
 Why, I never!
Media:vo eqxs002 2 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: You're back.
Media:vo eqxs002 2 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Hmm. Indeed.
Media:vo eqxs002 2 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: It is as I thought — this sword grows stronger as you use it in battle.
Media:vo eqxs002 2 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: And that's precisely what makes it special.
Media:vo eqxs002 2 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: Ah yes, I should mention a more important matter first.
Media:vo eqxs002 2 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: I've investigated the area nearby, and I've discovered some unusual signs.
Media:vo eqxs002 2 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: I believe that these strange traces require investigation.
Media:vo eqxs002 2 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: Whether it be thieves or something else, we shall investigate, and we shall find out.
Media:vo eqxs002 2 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: It would be rather convenient to rob adventurers who come up here, yes.
Media:vo eqxs002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Albedo!
Media:vo eqxs002 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Haha! We've been working hard on the sword you know? Check it out!
Media:vo eqxs002 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: I thought that only applied to people.
Media:vo eqxs002 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: It's not more thieves, is it?
Media:vo eqxs002 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: That's true...
Media:vo eqxs002 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Lots of human activity here, that's for sure.
Media:vo eqxs002 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Looks like more than one person, too.
Media:vo eqxs002 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: So they have a camp here... Hmph! Here to steal, just as usual.
Media:vo eqxs002 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: It's survival of the fittest here on this mountain, huh?
Media:vo eqxs002 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: All that stealing though, and still every last one of them's still poor as dirt...
Media:vo eqxs002 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Hmph! Anyone who calls us thieves gets no pity from Paimon!
(Conversation with Albedo is interrupted by Treasure Hoarders)
Media:vo eqxs002 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Argh, we're busted!
Media:vo eqxs002 2 thoardera 01.ogg ???: Who's that? Who're these sniveling sneaks snooping around our camp?
Media:vo eqxs002 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? What are the Fatui doing here!?
Media:vo eqxs002 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: And those Treasure Hoarders look just as confused as we do, too!
Media:vo eqxs002 6 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: The Fatui? And they chose to attack us within the Treasure Hoarders' camp... Did they follow us here?
Media:vo eqxs002 6 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Did you?
Media:vo eqxs002 6 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: I think the Fatui are looking for this sword.
Media:vo eqxs002 6 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: Perhaps they caught sight of you using it on the mountain.
Media:vo eqxs002 6 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: If their eyes are any good, they'll definitely have seen how this sword stands out from the rest.
Media:vo eqxs002 6 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: Not quite, no.
Media:vo eqxs002 6 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: The Fatui are collecting things related the archons. This, I believe, is known to you.
Media:vo eqxs002 6 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: Durin is the sworn enemy of the Anemo Archon, and had power comparable to his.
Media:vo eqxs002 6 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: To say that it could rival the archons, or was related to them... Neither is an overstatement.
Media:vo eqxs002 6 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: I made a new discovery while sketching nearby.
Media:vo eqxs002 6 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: There's an area up ahead that's quite remarkable. Its ley lines flow differently from any other.
Media:vo eqxs002 6 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: Nearby monsters have been attracted to it and have fallen under its influence. As a result, their constitutions have come to far surpass others of the same kind.
Media:vo eqxs002 6 albedo 13.ogg Albedo: Precisely my intention. Oh, and do remember to observe how various enemies affect this sword differently while you're at it, please.
Media:vo eqxs002 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: But why would they do that?
Media:vo eqxs002 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Did you go rile them up while we weren't looking?
Media:vo eqxs002 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Um, maybe it's something we all did, then...
Media:vo eqxs002 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Eh!? Weren't you keeping this sword super secret? How did they know it existed?
Media:vo eqxs002 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: They really want everything, don't they?
Media:vo eqxs002 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Huh. Now that you mention it, we did hear Master Diluc say that.
Media:vo eqxs002 6 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: So that's how it is...
Media:vo eqxs002 6 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: That seems convenient.
Media:vo eqxs002 6 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Well, we're here to help this sword grow, aren't we? Might as well go try it out on those monsters!
Media:vo eqxs002 9 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: I have a hypothesis concerning this.
Media:vo eqxs002 9 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Each time this sword absorbs power from the bodies of fallen enemies, it will resonate with Durin's remains, hidden somewhere on this mountain.
Media:vo eqxs002 9 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: If my theory proves correct, this could mean that all the monsters here may be resonating with Durin's body.
Media:vo eqxs002 9 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: I fear this may have to do with the origin of these monsters' powers.
Media:vo eqxs002 9 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: Durin is no ordinary beast. Even though it is long dead, the entire mountain is still held in thrall by its corpse.
Media:vo eqxs002 9 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: The dragon's mysterious power... may itself be a form of curse.
Media:vo eqxs002 9 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: We still don't have enough information. If we wish to understand more, more data is required. This is where you come in.
Media:vo eqxs002 9 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: I have some research work that needs settling, so we will have to work separately for now. Let's meet up again near the broken bridge.
Media:vo eqxs002 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So, how did it feel?
Media:vo eqxs002 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Holy moly, that sounds amazing!
Media:vo eqxs002 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Guess story-time's become work—time...
