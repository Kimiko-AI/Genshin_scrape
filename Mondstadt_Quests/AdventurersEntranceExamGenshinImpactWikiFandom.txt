Media:vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Hmm... Are the questions too difficult? If even Noelle wasn't up to the task...
Media:vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Never mind, don't worry too much. This was just testing your rote learning ability, anyway. It wouldn't be much practical help on an adventure.

Media:vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Hahaha, that's three for three! As expected, these questions were no match for you.

Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Steak! Steak! Hahaha, hands down the top choice of a true adventurer!
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Simple ingredients, high nutritious, and most importantly, all you need to cook it is an open flame!
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Mm... And when it's not an emergency, adding a bit of seasoning makes it even better. Succulent and juicy, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside... The perfect accompaniment to an alcoholic beverage...
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Really?
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: If you like it so much, I can always make a few more!
 This was all a ploy to get Noelle to cook some drunk food for you...
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Ahaha, not at all! I was merely contemplating having a celebratory libation on Noelle's behalf.
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: In any case, congratulation on passing part two of the exam! Up next is the final stage.
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: Go get yourself ready, then meet me at Brightcrown Canyon.

Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: *sniff* Mondstadt Grilled Fish, if I'm not mistaken? The fragrance is certainly rather rejuvenating.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: So... Mondstadt Grilled Fish... is the correct answer?
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Well, uh, the issue is... many people can't eat fish that hasn't been seasoned with plenty of pepper.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: I, for one, am quite happy to eat it straight from the grill with no seasoning at all... But basically, I think there are more straightforward dishes available.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Oh, I see... I'm sorry, I didn't take that into consideration...
(If the player passed the first test)

Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Ah, don't get down in the dumps! I've saved the best part of the exam for last.

 This is all the result of your hard work.
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Not entirely... whenever I've taken an exam in the past, I always get nervous and I can't control it.
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: I know that it's just like in training, but I always end up worrying I might fail...
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: But not this time... This time, it seems I was able to remain calm.
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Somehow, having you by my side is... soothing...
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: It must be because you are here with me that I was able to complete the exam.
 No, Noelle. It's because you have what it takes.
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Thank you, thank you...
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: ...On the day of the real exam, if — and I mean only if...
 I will have time.
 I will be there.

Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Ohhhh....
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: In the end, I... I couldn't do it...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: My palms were sweating, and my heart was racing, and...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: I know that it's just like in training, but still, I always end up worrying I might fail...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: And in the end, I couldn't even solve the problem at hand...
 It's not because you lack the ability...
 It's because you were too fixated on the formality of the exam...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: But if I cannot perform well in an exam, what good is my ability...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: *sigh* Maybe... I should train some more...

Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Hmm... Maybe the difficulty level is too high after all...
 About the adventurers' ranking exams...
 Calla Lily.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 24.ogg Cyrus: Ooh, I'm afraid... That's the wrong answer...
 Dandelion Seeds.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 24.ogg Cyrus: Ooh, I'm afraid... That's the wrong answer...
 Emergency Food.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Emergency Food...? Though I have never tried any, it doesn't sound like a specific dish... Let's think of something else.
 Here's the situation...
 I meant Noelle...
 I wasn't asking for me...
 I will be there.
 I will have time.
 It's because you were too fixated on the formality of the exam...
 It's not because you lack the ability...
 Jare Mivani.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 33.ogg Cyrus: Wrong answer! Huh... Was that supposed to be some sort of joke?
 Let's give it a try.
 Mair Javiri.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 33.ogg Cyrus: Wrong answer! Huh... Was that supposed to be some sort of joke?
 Mare Jivari.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 32.ogg Cyrus: Correct! Keep this name in mind. Some day, you too will pass through this domain!
 Mare Safari.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 33.ogg Cyrus: Wrong answer! Huh... Was that supposed to be some sort of joke?
 Mondstadt Grilled Fish.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Mondstadt Grilled Fish... You have a point. All it needs is a fish fillet and some pepper.
 No, Noelle. It's because you have what it takes.
 Noelle's Study Notes
 Noelle, let's go back and do some studying!
 Noelle, stay strong!
 Noelle... Are you okay?
 Pretty sure there was no such exam when I first joined...
 Quest DescriptionAfter fully understanding Noelle's reasons for seeking him out, an elated and excited Cyrus decides to put you both through his new exam at the highest difficulty level.
 Quest DescriptionFrom Katheryne, you and Noelle learn that the Adventurers' Guild Branch Master, Cyrus, is currently working on an entrance exam for new adventurers.
 Quest DescriptionNoelle reveals to you that she is very anxious about the Knights of Favonius selection exam. At your suggestion, the two of you head to the Adventurers' Guild, hoping to get some extra exam experience.
 Roald.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: That's it! It's Roald!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 28.ogg Cyrus: Correct! I had thought this question would be a little more challenging to adventurers from Mondstadt. Once again, Noelle, you never fail to impress.
 Sayid.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 29.ogg Cyrus: Ooh, what a pity... You were so close, but not quite close enough. Never mind, eh.
 Small Lamp Grass.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 24.ogg Cyrus: Ooh, I'm afraid... That's the wrong answer...
 So even at the highest difficulty, you can just get someone else to help...?
 So you can still pass the exam even if you're no good at combat...
 Steak.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Steak? Good point! In a real emergency, all you'd need is a piece of meat... you wouldn't even need any seasoning.
 Surely these topics won't be covered in the Knights' selection exam?
 This is all the result of your hard work.
 This was all a ploy to get Noelle to cook some drunk food for you...
 What are you doing?
 Wilde.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 29.ogg Cyrus: Ooh, what a pity... You were so close, but not quite close enough. Never mind, eh.
 Windwheel Aster.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: That's it! The Windwheel Aster mostly grows in Stormterror's Lair, at Windrise, and near Statues of The Seven. All the others are much more widely found...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: Mr. Cyrus, our answer is Windwheel Aster!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 23.ogg Cyrus: Correct! There's no fooling you two, eh?
 Wyatt.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 29.ogg Cyrus: Ooh, what a pity... You were so close, but not quite close enough. Never mind, eh.

Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 01.ogg Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild. What kind of commission would you like to take on today?
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 02.ogg Katheryne: You wish to take an exam? Please wait while I verify your adventure record and the status of your recent commissions...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 03.ogg Katheryne: Oh? Noelle... You are finally ready to join the Adventurers' Guild? Wonderful, I will process your application at once...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 04.ogg Katheryne: I see... What a pity.
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 05.ogg Katheryne: Our exams are only available to official members of the Guild. The content of each exam is determined based on the adventurer's individual experience and commission status. As such, I am unfortunately unable to arrange for you to have an exam.
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 06.ogg Katheryne: However... since you just want to experience what an exam is like, perhaps you can talk to Cyrus, the branch master?
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 07.ogg Katheryne: As it happens, he has recently been working on a new entrance exam for the Guild. It has not yet been approved for official use... Perhaps you could give it a trial run?
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 08.ogg Katheryne: Indeed... Although, the entrance exam does have something to do with you joining the Guild...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 09.ogg Katheryne: You can ask Branch Master Cyrus if you require more details. He should be at Angel's Share right now drafting a syllabus. He said he gets more "inspired" when he's there...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 10.ogg Katheryne: We don't yet know what's included in the syllabus. Others in the Guild have produced several drafts, but all of them were rejected by Cyrus...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Sorry, Ms. Katheryne. Actually, I am the one who wishes to take the exam...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: No, no... I just want to take an exam for the experience...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Right now, I don't have any plan to become an adventurer... I'm sorry...
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: It sounds as if I'll have a good chance of running into something unexpected.
Media:vo noecop002 1908501 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Yes, let's... I wonder what will be on the exam...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Hunt down three Ruin Guards... Hmm, could it be a little too difficult? Ugh, what am I thinking, the newcomers will run a mile...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Hunt down three boars in the forest... Nay, the Guild will never approve that...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Oh, it's you... and Noelle, I see...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Ugh, don't get me started... Since (Traveler) solved the Stormterror crisis and became Mondstadt's hero, a whole load of young people got excited and decided to join the Adventurers' Guild...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: But most of them have no experience at all. They can't even handle a single slime without getting all battered and bruised in the process. So, some genius in the Guild decided: Why don't we make an entrance exam? *sigh*
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: ...Yes, but if the exam is too difficult, no one will want to join!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 07.ogg Cyrus: A few scrapes and bruises is nothing a strong will can't compensate for! Why doesn't anyone else in the Guild understand this...?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 08.ogg Cyrus: Anyway, I already rejected two drafts, and now I am working on a third one myself. It's absolutely crucial that I get the difficulty level right...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 09.ogg Cyrus: *sigh* If only someone could give it a test run... At least then I could decide where the upper limit of difficulty should be...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 10.ogg Cyrus: Oh? Noelle, you mean... you want to take the adventurer's entrance exam?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 11.ogg Cyrus: Haha! That's fantastic! Well, if it's you, Noelle... even with every challenge at the highest difficulty, you shouldn't have any problem at all.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 12.ogg Cyrus: Excellent! That's the spirit of a true adventurer! Now, let me explain the rules of the exam.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 13.ogg Cyrus: First, since adventurers often work in groups, you are welcome to invite others to assist you during the exam.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 14.ogg Cyrus: If (Traveler) is willing, please join Noelle.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 15.ogg Cyrus: Indeed. Second, there are three parts to the exam, which are basic knowledge, survival skills, and a combat exercise.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 16.ogg Cyrus: You only need to pass two out of three parts to succeed in the exam... but of course, Noelle should find she has no trouble getting a perfect score.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 17.ogg Cyrus: Ahem... And finally, remember at all times that being an adventurer takes courage and resilience! Ad astra abyssosque!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 18.ogg Cyrus: Haha, that's the spirit. Without further ado, let's start part one — basic knowledge.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 19.ogg Cyrus: A true adventurer must be well-versed in all sorts of relevant knowledge to handle whatever may come their way.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 20.ogg Cyrus: I will ask you three questions. You may discuss among yourselves first before giving me an answer.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 21.ogg Cyrus: Question one. An adventurer must be well acquainted with their environment to make sure they can obtain any resources they need.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 22.ogg Cyrus: Tell me, which of the following local specialties of Mondstadt cannot be found near Wolvendom? Dandelion Seeds, Calla Lilies, Windwheel Asters, or Small Lamp Grass?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 23.ogg Cyrus: Correct! There's no fooling you two, eh?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 24.ogg Cyrus: Ooh, I'm afraid... That's the wrong answer...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 25.ogg Cyrus: On to question two. An adventurer must always learn from their experience and keep track of everything they encounter in the form of a diary.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 26.ogg Cyrus: There is a famous adventurer who once went exploring all over Liyue, documenting his whole journey.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 27.ogg Cyrus: Thanks to the notes he took of each location that he went, young adventurers are now able to plan ahead and avoid the dangers there. What is the name of this adventurer?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 28.ogg Cyrus: Correct! I had thought this question would be a little more challenging to adventurers from Mondstadt. Once again, Noelle, you never fail to impress.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 29.ogg Cyrus: Ooh, what a pity... You were so close, but not quite close enough. Never mind, eh.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 30.ogg Cyrus: Last question. Let's have some fun with this one. The most terrifying domain for adventurers from Mondstadt, the infamous windless land...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 31.ogg Cyrus: All that awaits you there is a sea of ashes and the deathly silence in the air... So, what is the name of this taboo territory?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 32.ogg Cyrus: Correct! Keep this name in mind. Some day, you too will pass through this domain!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 33.ogg Cyrus: Wrong answer! Huh... Was that supposed to be some sort of joke?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Hello, Mr. Cyrus. Are you working on the exam syllabus? How is it coming along?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: That sounds... like a good idea, no? This way, the adventurers won't get hurt so easily.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Then... Mr. Cyrus, may I give it a try?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: I am very interested in... in experiencing the adventurer's entrance exam!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Yes, please make sure they are the most difficult!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Ad... Ad astra abyssosque...!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Hmm, Wolvendom... I remember reading that there are Wolfhooks everywhere, but the book made no specific mention of any other plants...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Hmm... No, I must approach this question differently... Is there anything here that requires specific environmental conditions in order to grow? Conditions that Wolvendom cannot provide?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: That's it! The Windwheel Aster mostly grows in Stormterror's Lair, at Windrise, and near Statues of The Seven. All the others are much more widely found...
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: Mr. Cyrus, our answer is Windwheel Aster!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Learning from experience, writing diaries... It seems like adventuring requires constant self-reflection, just like studying.
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Regarding this adventurer... I do believe I have read about him. He even made his mark on Dragonspine. Yes, it must be him... Hmm... Oh, what was his name...?
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: That's it! It's Roald!
Media:vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: A sea of ashes... A windless land... What could it be...?
Media:vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Hmm... Are the questions too difficult? If even Noelle wasn't up to the task...
Media:vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Never mind, don't worry too much. This was just testing your rote learning ability, anyway. It wouldn't be much practical help on an adventure.
Media:vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Hahaha, that's three for three! As expected, these questions were no match for you.
Media:vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: But be warned, things start to get a little trickier in the survival skills test!
Media:vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: Now, go and prepare yourselves. Meet me at Good Hunter when you think you're ready.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Okay, let's begin with part two of the entrance exam.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Staying well-fed and making sure to prepare sufficient food supplies is a key survival skill for adventurers.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: That's why the second part of the exam is to prepare a food item fit for an emergency out in the wild. There are three criteria:
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Firstly, the ingredients must be easily accessible in the wilderness.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: Secondly, preparation and cooking must be quick and easy.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: Thirdly... Well, the food item in question must be able to help someone in dire straits to bounce back from the brink and regain their strength!
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 07.ogg Cyrus: So go ahead, cook something full of passion and packed with flavor! Just bring it to me whenever it's ready. Noelle... I await your dish with the greatest anticipation! Haha!
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Ready and willing, Mr. Cyrus.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Hmm... simple ingredients, easy to cook, helps you rally...
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: (Traveler), do you have any idea?
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Mondstadt Grilled Fish... You have a point. All it needs is a fish fillet and some pepper.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Steak? Good point! In a real emergency, all you'd need is a piece of meat... you wouldn't even need any seasoning.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Emergency Food...? Though I have never tried any, it doesn't sound like a specific dish... Let's think of something else.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Okay then. Once it's ready, let's take it over to Mr. Cyrus.
Media:vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: We can always change our minds if we have a better idea. One must be careful not to act too hastily when taking an exam.
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Steak! Steak! Hahaha, hands down the top choice of a true adventurer!
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Simple ingredients, high nutritious, and most importantly, all you need to cook it is an open flame!
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Mm... And when it's not an emergency, adding a bit of seasoning makes it even better. Succulent and juicy, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside... The perfect accompaniment to an alcoholic beverage...
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Ahaha, not at all! I was merely contemplating having a celebratory libation on Noelle's behalf.
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: In any case, congratulation on passing part two of the exam! Up next is the final stage.
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: Go get yourself ready, then meet me at Brightcrown Canyon.
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Really?
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: If you like it so much, I can always make a few more!
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: *sniff* Mondstadt Grilled Fish, if I'm not mistaken? The fragrance is certainly rather rejuvenating.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Well, uh, the issue is... many people can't eat fish that hasn't been seasoned with plenty of pepper.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: I, for one, am quite happy to eat it straight from the grill with no seasoning at all... But basically, I think there are more straightforward dishes available.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Ah, don't get down in the dumps! I've saved the best part of the exam for last.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: Go get yourself ready and meet me at Brightcrown Canyon.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: ...Oh, you're ready to go? Don't be too hasty, now. You still have time to prepare, use it wisely.
(If Mondstadt Grilled Fish is given)

Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: *sniff* Mondstadt Grilled Fish, if I'm not mistaken? The fragrance is certainly rather rejuvenating.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: So... Mondstadt Grilled Fish... is the correct answer?
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Well, uh, the issue is... many people can't eat fish that hasn't been seasoned with plenty of pepper.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: I, for one, am quite happy to eat it straight from the grill with no seasoning at all... But basically, I think there are more straightforward dishes available.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Oh, I see... I'm sorry, I didn't take that into consideration...
(If the player passed the first test)

Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Ah, don't get down in the dumps! I've saved the best part of the exam for last.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: Go get yourself ready and meet me at Brightcrown Canyon.
(If the player failed the first test)

Hangout Failed
(If Steak is given)

Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Steak! Steak! Hahaha, hands down the top choice of a true adventurer!
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Simple ingredients, high nutritious, and most importantly, all you need to cook it is an open flame!
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Mm... And when it's not an emergency, adding a bit of seasoning makes it even better. Succulent and juicy, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside... The perfect accompaniment to an alcoholic beverage...
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Really?
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: If you like it so much, I can always make a few more!
 This was all a ploy to get Noelle to cook some drunk food for you...
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Ahaha, not at all! I was merely contemplating having a celebratory libation on Noelle's behalf.
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: In any case, congratulation on passing part two of the exam! Up next is the final stage.
Media:vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: Go get yourself ready, then meet me at Brightcrown Canyon.
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: So... Mondstadt Grilled Fish... is the correct answer?
Media:vo noecop002 1908603 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Oh, I see... I'm sorry, I didn't take that into consideration...
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Ad astra abyssosque, and welcome to the third and final part of your exam. Are you ready?
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Good! Now. The most important skillset for an adventurer is, of course... combat skills!
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Ferocious monsters, dangerous machines... Only in the heat of the battle against your enemy does that surge of adrenaline really kick in!
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: This is the last part of the exam... Defeat the nearby Ruin Guard as quickly as you can.
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: I will be watching from here. Give it all you've got, Noelle!
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: Go for it, Noelle! Remember, keep track of your time!
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Please... begin. I am ready.
Media:vo noecop002 1908701 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Okay! This time... I am confident I will pass!
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: *catches breath*
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Honorary Knight! I did it!
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Not entirely... whenever I've taken an exam in the past, I always get nervous and I can't control it.
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: I know that it's just like in training, but I always end up worrying I might fail...
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: But not this time... This time, it seems I was able to remain calm.
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Somehow, having you by my side is... soothing...
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: It must be because you are here with me that I was able to complete the exam.
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Thank you, thank you...
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: ...On the day of the real exam, if — and I mean only if...
Media:vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: Great! Maybe, just maybe, things will be different this time...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Ohhhh....
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: In the end, I... I couldn't do it...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: My palms were sweating, and my heart was racing, and...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: I know that it's just like in training, but still, I always end up worrying I might fail...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: And in the end, I couldn't even solve the problem at hand...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: But if I cannot perform well in an exam, what good is my ability...
Media:vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: *sigh* Maybe... I should train some more...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Oh, back already? Seems like...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Even the third part of the exam is a walk in the park for you!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Hmm... Maybe the difficulty level is too high after all...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Now, please allow me to announce the results of your adventurer's entrance examination...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: ...You passed with a perfect score! Noelle, you are incredible, as always!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: Without further ado, it gives me great pleasure to officially grant you the title of adventurer!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 07.ogg Cyrus: May your days ahead be filled with adventure, and may you boldly explore the stars above and the abyss below! Ad astra abyssosque! Hahaha!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 08.ogg Cyrus: My, my, I never thought I'd see the day when Noelle would finally come around to the idea of joining the Adventurers' Guild...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 09.ogg Cyrus: There's no need to talk like an outsider anymore! From now on, you can call me Branch Master, and I will call you Adventurer!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 10.ogg Cyrus: Ah? You mean...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 11.ogg Cyrus: How... How can this be? I was just about to recommend you to the perfect Adventure Team...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 12.ogg Cyrus: Wh—Why not give it some more thought? Even if you're not ready to be a full-time adventurer, you'd be more than welcome to help out every now and then.
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 13.ogg Cyrus: Just think of it as, uh... Ah, yes, think of it as part of your exam preparation!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 14.ogg Cyrus: You know, if you think about it, adventurers have a lot in common with the Knights.... both want to defend Mondstadt!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 15.ogg Cyrus: Yes, precisely! I assure you it won't take up too much of your time. I believe it's only around four commissions per day...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 16.ogg Cyrus: Please, Noelle! I'm begging you, we need your help!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 17.ogg Cyrus: ...You successfully passed the exam! And you were so close to getting a perfect score... It feels like a missed opportunity...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 18.ogg Cyrus: But... if even Noelle could not get a perfect score, then maybe... I still need to adjust the difficulty level a little further...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 19.ogg Cyrus: Yes, the barrier to entry must be lowered to cater to the newcomers, then we can raise the difficulty at a later stage... Only in this way can we successfully attract newcomers...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 20.ogg Cyrus: Hey now, first things first! Allow me to congratulate you on what was nevertheless a sterling performance in your exam! I will have Katheryne handle the admission process for you right away...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 21.ogg Cyrus: Uhh... Noelle?
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 22.ogg Cyrus: Huh... I was about to ask whether you would have the time to visit the Guild with me...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 23.ogg Cyrus: N—Noelle? You... you already passed your exam. What do you need to study for? Sure, you made a few mistakes, but this is an overreaction...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 24.ogg Cyrus: ...I see. *sigh* Well, (Traveler), when you get back, would you mind going to the library and checking on Noelle?
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 25.ogg Cyrus: I hope my exam hasn't affected her mood...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 26.ogg Cyrus: How can I get the exam to the right difficulty level? Hmm... I should go back to the Angel's Share and give this some careful consideration over an alcoholic beverage...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: It's all because... I had an Honorary Knight by my side...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Oh — oh Mr. Cyrus, I... I'm terribly sorry, but actually, I...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: I'm very sorry, but... I actually wasn't planning to join the Adventurers' Guild at all.
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: I just wanted to take an exam, so I could get used to the atmosphere... I thought it might help me better prepare for the Knights of Favonius selection exam.
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: ...Exam preparation? ...Defend Mondstadt?
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Four commissions... M—Maybe if I can squeeze out some time from my breaks...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Argh, if I'm not careful the urge to accommodate just takes over...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: I'm sorry, Mr. Cyrus. But I'm afraid that my answer is still—
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Ooh, uhh... Well, if my assistance is required...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: Ohh... Okay! Sorry, Mr. Cyrus, maybe next time!
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: I... I didn't get a perfect score...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: ...Where did I go wrong? Is there any hope for me to improve? If I could start over...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: Oh, I'm sorry... Mr. Cyrus, what were you saying just now? I was a little lost in my own thoughts...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: I do apologize, Mr. Cyrus... I must get back to my exam preparation.
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: If I don't review my mistakes, I will only repeat them the next time I run into the same problem...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: It seems... I still have lots to learn...
Media:vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: I will head back to the library now, and continue studying!
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: *dozing off*
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Mustn't... fall... asleep
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Ah... sorry, I zoned out a little... I didn't notice you there...
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: I've summarized my experiences from the mock exam and created a new reading list...
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: "Getting to Know Mondstadt's Geography" and "A One-Minute History of Adventuring in Mondstadt"... There is so much I can learn from them.
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Then there's "Eating Well in Mondstadt"... I never realized there were so many ways to cook in the wild.
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: And also "Self Defense: The Art of Down-to-Earth Dialogue With Monsters"... The combat approach of adventurers is definitely worth further study.
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: The only thing is... There is so much to get through. Will I really be able to finish them all?
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: But, but... what if this is the one time they do come up? What then?
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: What if they ask me... How to rescue an adventurer... Or how best to collaborate with the Adventurers' Guild...
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: If I neglect these topics now... I may live to regret it later.
Media:vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: *sigh* It looks like every second I have between now and my exam is going to count.
Noelle's Study Notes: "Windwheel Asters commonly found at Stormterror's Lair and Windrise," "Hit Ruin Guards in weak spots to gain upper hand"...
Noelle's Study Notes: Each and every new detail learned during the adventure is recorded in neat and tidy handwriting — though it starts to get messier as you go down the page.
Noelle's Study Notes: Some vague descriptions are closely followed by precise annotations adding further detail. This seems to be evidence of the writer fighting a valiant battle against sleepiness.
