Diona - Kätzlein Cocktail
Diona, the bartender at The Cat's Tail, hates all alcoholic beverages, but has a rare talent for bartending.
No matter the drink, as long as the mixing is in her hands, it will be unimaginably delicious.
Her excellent bartending skills and her cat's ears and tail that run in her family, are popular among punters, making The Cat's Tail extremely popular.
However, please take care not to touch Diona's ears or tail when ordering at the bar. If you cross her, the consequences will be dire.

(If the player has not met Sucrose yet, an introductory note appears on screen)
Sucrose - Harmless Sweetie
Sucrose is an alchemist from Mondstadt with an insatiable curiosity towards the natural world, leading her to focus on bio-alchemy in her research.
Whether it be a special potion that increases the nectar output of Sweet Flowers or a special spray that keeps Sunsettias fresh, Sucrose is always finding ways to use bio-alchemical techniques to add variety and color to this world.
Perhaps it is because Sucrose channels most of her energy into her experiments and research that she comes off as a bit shy in social situations.

Media:vo tips tcg001 3 margaret 02.ogg Margaret: You know, Prince. This is The Cat's Tail, after all, so I thought having a cat take care of our new customers would be quite a nice touch.

 ...Hold on, I need a moment. I'll be right back.
 ...Hold on, I need a moment. I'll be right back.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 07b 1.ogg Sucrose: Take your time, I look forward to our first duel.
 A Casket of Tomes?
 A duel between beginners?
 Actually, we do have some cards...
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 sucrose 02a 1.ogg Sucrose: That's right, we have some cards that I received from a friend.
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 diona 04a 1.ogg Diona: Uhh... you're gonna need a few more cards than that.
 Adventure Challenge
 Agreed. It was a brilliant game.
 Amazing...
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 06a 1.ogg Shuyun: Yes, it was the sacred duels of Genius Invokation TCG that formed and cemented our bonds of mutual understanding. It's my firm belief that by simply playing the game, players can develop a deeper level of understanding between one another.
 But it's time... to duel!!!
Media:vo tips tcg001 26 swan 03a 1.ogg Swan: ...I see you're serious about this. Very well. As a fellow TCG player, I cannot refuse an earnest invitation to duel.
 Can't be bad for business...
 Cool! A TCG friend finder!
 Don't you have a practice deck we could try?
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 paimon 01b 1.ogg Paimon: Yeah, we need a practice deck! Can't you just let us use one?
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 diona 04b 1.ogg Diona: Tch, there's no such thing!
 Fur? From The Cat's Tail staff?
 Genius what now?
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 05b 1.ogg Paimon: Genius Invokation TCG! Haven't you heard of it before?
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 05b 2.ogg Paimon: Apparently it's a game that was invented by a scholar in the Akademiya. People from all over are playing it now!
 Hopefully an instant victory card?
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 paimon 04b 1.ogg Paimon: No card game in the world has a card like that. Paimon bets it's some kind of prize for making it as an official TCG player!
 Hopefully not another test...
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 paimon 04a 1.ogg Paimon: Probably not... Oh, Paimon bets it's some kind of prize for making it as an official TCG player!
 I challenge you to a duel!
 I dare not take advantage of the Prinzessin's generosity...
 I didn't notice you play any matches, Paimon...
 I will face you again right here, right now!
Media:vo dialog tips tcg001 fischl 04a 1.ogg Fischl: Then show me once more what you are made of!

Media:vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 08a 1.ogg Paimon: Okay, fine! Paimon's curious and would like to give it a try! ...Please?
 Invitation Board?
 It was a close call...
 Let's play some Genius Invokation TCG!
Media:vo dialog tips tcg001 sucrose 03a 1.ogg Sucrose: Alright, let the duel begin!
 Naturally.
 No, not at all.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 paimon 01a 1.ogg Paimon: You snuck in without making a sound...
 Not just yet, I need a moment...
Media:vo dialog tips tcg001 diona 02b 1.ogg Diona: Sure, just let me know once you're ready. Hmph, but don't keep me waiting too long!
 Not just yet, I need a moment...

 Not just yet, I need a moment...
Media:vo dialog tips tcg001 sucrose 03b 1.ogg Sucrose: Sure. Even though it's just a game, it's important to be fully prepared. In that case, I think I'll go over the card stats again...
 Not just yet, I need a moment...
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 diona 10b 1.ogg Diona: Okay, I guess I'll get things set up on the table first. Once you're ready, we can get started.
 Not yet... I entreat Your Majesty to ask me again later...
Media:vo dialog tips tcg001 fischl 02b 1.ogg Fischl: Very well, I will ask you again when the time comes. But be warned, should you seek to flee when the hour of the battle draws nigh... I shall show you no mercy.
 Quest DescriptionSomeone in Mondstadt's alchemy store seems to be talking about a strange package they received recently. Go check it out.
 Right, Prince's paws probably can't hold the cards...
 So this is the game we've been hearing about.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 05a 1.ogg Paimon: Yeah, we've been hearing about this game all over the place, but this is the first time we've ever actually seen any of the cards.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 05a 2.ogg Paimon: We didn't know it had made it all the way to Mondstadt. Must be pretty popular, huh?
 Sounds like a convenient way of finding other TCG players.
 Step DescriptionSo the cards Sucrose received are Genius Invokation TCG cards. Why not try the Genius Invokation TCG and become a player yourself?
 Sure, I look forward to it!
 That's Kaeya...
 That's Margaret's place...
 That's pretty weird...
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 06b 1.ogg Shuyun: It was the duels of Genius Invokation TCG that allowed our hearts to bond. It's understandable that ordinary people such as yourselves are unable to comprehend such a thing.
 The Cat's Tail...
 Then you desperately need to play this game.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 08b 1.ogg Paimon: Oh, just wait until Paimon plays it enough to become smarter than you. Then you'll be sorry!
 There's no doubt about it...
 There's really a test?
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 04a 1.ogg Shuyun: Yes, although to be honest, it's not that difficult...
 Trust in your cards.
 Uh... What research project?
 Verily, 'tis time to duel!
Media:vo dialog tips tcg001 fischl 02a 1.ogg Fischl: Then it is time to see what you are made of!
 Verily, 'tis time to duel!
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 08a 1.ogg Fischl: Then I say it is time to see what you are made of!
 Waah! Wha— Oh! When did YOU get here...
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 06b 1.ogg Diona: You have slow reactions... Wait— are you copying me!? Shut up!
 Wait, wait, wait, I need to check my deck first...
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 08b 1.ogg Fischl: Oh, do you? How disappointing. But then again, for one accustomed to the petty burdens of this lowly realm, to challenge the Prinzessin is a load under which most mere mortals would crumble.
 Well, it is a thank-you gift.
 What a backstory...
 What does it entail? Sealing a Samachurl within a deck of cards?
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 04b 1.ogg Shuyun: It's just a tabletop card game. I'm not sure how you would plan on achieving something like that...
 When you say "watched" many games...
 Where have I heard that before?
 Yes! ...But I need a moment to rethink my strategy first.
Media:vo dialog tips tcg001 fischl 04b 1.ogg Fischl: Very well. When you think you are ready, I shall be right here waiting for you.
 You can win this.
 You up for a game now?

Media:vo dialog tips tcg001 diona 10.ogg Diona: Ugh, let me guess — you're here to order a drink, hmph... Oh, it's you. So, how are your Genius Invokation matches going?
Media:vo dialog tips tcg001 diona 11.ogg Diona: You need to win three matches to become an official TCG player? Ohh yeah, now you mention it, I remember there being some sort of rule about that. Why'd they have to make it so competitive? It's just a game, why can't people just have fun!
Media:vo dialog tips tcg001 diona 12.ogg Diona: Hmph, I'll never understand why grown-ups have to put a bunch of stupid rules on everything.

Media:vo dialog tips tcg001 suyun 04.ogg Shuyun: Yes, heed Prince's words. Besides, I need to keep mixing drinks for now. If you wait until I'm free, I can have Prince explain more for you...

Media:vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Genius Invokation TCG!
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 05a 1.ogg Paimon: Yeah, we've been hearing about this game all over the place, but this is the first time we've ever actually seen any of the cards.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 05a 2.ogg Paimon: We didn't know it had made it all the way to Mondstadt. Must be pretty popular, huh?

Media:vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Oh? Why's that?
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Ah, right... And since it's a game from Sumeru, who knows, playing it might even make you smarter!
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 08a 1.ogg Paimon: Okay, fine! Paimon's curious and would like to give it a try! ...Please?
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 08b 1.ogg Paimon: Oh, just wait until Paimon plays it enough to become smarter than you. Then you'll be sorry!
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: ...Although it seems like we can't learn how to play it anytime soon 'cause Timaeus has given up for a while.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get going!
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: No, this package didn't contain any hazardous materials...
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Yes. I believe it's from a Sumeru scholar who came here to study in Mondstadt. It's most likely a thank-you gift for collaborating on some research together.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: There wasn't anything dangerous inside, just a bunch of strange cards.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: I think I've seen Timaeus with some similar-looking cards before, so I came to ask him about what they might be.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: No, they didn't look like test cards. Here, have a look...

Media:vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: No, never. Recently, I've been spending all my time up in the mountains working on cultivating Pentatanic Sweet Flowers. Why, is this an area of research that has started trending in the alchemical community during my absence?
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: Uh, Timaeus?
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: No, I was just thinking about that time you requested an extension on your progress report deadline, citing "personal reasons" for the delay...
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: Aw, well that's unfortunate.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 10.ogg Sucrose: Well, since it's a gift from a researcher I've collaborated with, I thought that I should at least try to learn the rules. That way, I could say that I at least tried to appreciate his gift.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 11.ogg Sucrose: Understood. (Traveler), Paimon, let's go to The Cat's Tail and try asking around.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 12.ogg Sucrose: To be honest, hearing Timaeus talking about the game has also piqued my curiosity.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 01.ogg Timaeus: So, Sucrose, the package you mentioned that you received before... It's not dangerous, is it?
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 02.ogg Timaeus: You need to be careful when you're opening packages. I once had a friend mail me some research materials, and all the bouncing around in transit caused a reaction...
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 03.ogg Timaeus: Once I opened it, it let out a stench that could wake the dead.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 04.ogg Timaeus: If your package contains anything like that, then maybe you should check with Albedo first and see what he thinks.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 05.ogg Timaeus: Oh, hey you two! We're just talking about a strange package that Sucrose received recently.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 06.ogg Timaeus: You've seen me with some cards? Ah, maybe those were the testing cards used for distinguishing reagents?
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 07.ogg Timaeus: Oh, you meant these... Huh, Sucrose, have you really never seen these before?
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 08.ogg Timaeus: Haha, you could definitely say that it's trending, but not as an area of research... It's a card game that's been getting really popular these days.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 09.ogg Timaeus: It's called "Genius Invokation TCG"!
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 10.ogg Timaeus: That's right. The game's been catching on lately. The Yae Publishing House in Inazuma has even published a series of light novels based on the game. The story is really good!
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 11.ogg Timaeus: It starts with a young guy in Sumeru who finds an ancient "Casket of Tomes" in the attic. He opens it, and discovers that the soul of an ancient TCG player called the Crocodile King has been captured inside.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 12.ogg Timaeus: It turns out that the Crocodile King was King Deshret's viceroy, who battled an opponent named the Ibis King. During the match, the Crocodile King fell prey to his opponent's scheme and was sealed away in the Casket of Tomes.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 13.ogg Timaeus: After being unexpectedly released by the kid, the Crocodile King possesses him and helps him to gradually climb the ranks and become a legendary TCG player.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 14.ogg Timaeus: Huh? What's wrong, Sucrose? Uh, if you're interested in how the story plays out, I can lend you the novels.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 15.ogg Timaeus: Ahem, well... I did go through a phase recently where I wasn't putting enough focus on my work, but it's under control now. I've committed to not even touch Genius Invokation TCG until I've made enough progress in my research.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 16.ogg Timaeus: Haha, well research is my priority, you know.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 17.ogg Timaeus: But if you'd like to learn the rules of Genius Invokation TCG, then I'd actually suggest you go to The Cat's Tail.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 18.ogg Timaeus: Yep, that's the place. It's where everyone in the community goes to play when they have time. They gather there, trade cards... and they're very welcoming to new players.
Media:vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 19.ogg Timaeus: Trying to learn the rules can be intimidating at first, but it's a lot of fun once you get the hang of it.
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 diona 01.ogg Diona: Hehe, okay! Let's go through the rules. First things first, you'll be needing your deck, so place that on the table...
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 diona 02.ogg Diona: Uh, yes? You should have built a deck. You know, a set of cards that meets the bare minimum requirement to play the game...?
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 diona 03.ogg Diona: Huh-huh... what's with the blank stares? ...C'mon, don't tell me you came to learn Genius Invokation TCG without bringing any cards?
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 diona 04a 1.ogg Diona: Uhh... you're gonna need a few more cards than that.
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 diona 04b 1.ogg Diona: Tch, there's no such thing!
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 diona 05.ogg Diona: Okay, lemme think... To learn the game, you'll need at least two Character Cards to switch between...
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 diona 06.ogg Diona: Oh, oh! That reminds me, a few days ago when I was closing up for the night, I noticed a customer had left a couple of Character Cards on the bar counter. Haha! Maybe you could use those for now.
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 diona 07.ogg Diona: Eh, it's already been a few days and he still hasn't come back to claim them. Who knows, maybe he left them here on purpose...
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 diona 08.ogg Diona: Oh. Okay, yeah. Got them here with me, you know, just in case the customer came looking for them. Yeah, yeah, not because I like to play the game or anything. Please...
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 diona 09.ogg Diona: Yup. So, are you ready to start?
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 diona 10a 1.ogg Diona: Alright, then let's begin!
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 diona 10b 1.ogg Diona: Okay, I guess I'll get things set up on the table first. Once you're ready, we can get started.
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 paimon 01b 1.ogg Paimon: Yeah, we need a practice deck! Can't you just let us use one?
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Alright, so now we have two Character Cards. That's everything we need, right?
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: A... deck?
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 sucrose 02a 1.ogg Sucrose: That's right, we have some cards that I received from a friend.
Media:vo tips tcg001 11 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Are you sure that's okay...?
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: That was quite the detailed explanation. I didn't know The Cat's Tail's famous mixologist had such an eclectic skillset.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: I stepped in while you were in the middle of your explanation... I hope I didn't dampen the mood.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: The Cat's Tail is a player in Mondstadt's alcohol industry. Naturally, you have some collaboration with my winery.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: I'm here today to discuss a few items of business with Margaret...
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: Never mind, it's nothing urgent. In fact, I think I'm now more interested in this card that you're using to teach them the game.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: Although I have some degree of experience with Genius Invokation TCG, seeing this particular card is a first for me...
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 07.ogg Diluc: Oh? And what sort of a customer was he?
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 08.ogg Diluc: Eyepatch, you say...
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 09.ogg Diluc: Don't worry. Somehow, I don't think he'll be giving you any trouble over it...
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 10.ogg Diluc: I don't mind. It's just a card with my image on it.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 11.ogg Diluc: The game has been catching on lately, it's hard to go anywhere without hearing it mentioned. Every now and then, I'll sit down and play a game with the customers in Angel's Share.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 12.ogg Diluc: I was hoping we could play a game... But this issue of someone leaving a Character Card with my image at The Cat's Tail is... very intriguing.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 13.ogg Diluc: It's getting late, and someone has some explaining to do... We'll have to have that duel another time.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 14.ogg Diluc: Good. Then I'll take my leave.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 01.ogg Diona: Alright, cool, those are the basics. Did you get all that?
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 02.ogg Diona: What we just played was an Adventure Challenge, designed specially for new players.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 03.ogg Diona: Genius Invokation TCG can be played in duel mode, where each player brings three Character Cards, or in Adventure Challenge mode, with a fixed deck for each challenge.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 04.ogg Diona: But the rules are all the same. As long as you understand the basics, then you should be able to take on any of those rowdy boozehounds!
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 05.ogg Diona: Waah! Wha— Oh! When did YOU get here...
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 06b 1.ogg Diona: You have slow reactions... Wait— are you copying me!? Shut up!
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 07.ogg Diona: Ugh, anyway, what are you doing here?
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 08.ogg Diona: Too bad, she just left. But if you head off right now, you might still catch up with her!
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 09.ogg Diona: Wait, this card...?
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 10.ogg Diona: Uh, a customer left it behind a few days ago. But he wasn't even playing the game while he was here.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 11.ogg Diona: Uh... He wasn't wearing an eyepatch, okay? He had a light complexion, and a super serious look on his face. He wasn't much of a talker, and looked like he was just drinking his worries away. Eh... never seen him around here before!
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 12.ogg Diona: Gah, I was trying to give the opposite description, but I just ended up giving it away. Sorry, Guard Captain...
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 13.ogg Diona: You know where the door is! Don't let the door hit ya where Lord Barbatos split ya!
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 14.ogg Diona: Uh-oh... Guard Captain...
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 15.ogg Diona: Ooh, two new players having their first ever duel... haha! This sounds like fun!
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 16.ogg Diona: But, in order to play an official duel, you need to have three Character Cards.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 diona 17.ogg Diona: Remember, a complete deck has to have three Character Cards and thirty Action Cards. Got it?
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 paimon 01a 1.ogg Paimon: You snuck in without making a sound...
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's Diluc's Character Card.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So... what about the Diluc Character Card...?
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Although I feel there are still many details to grasp, I think I understand the basic premise of the game now.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: I didn't expect Diluc to be familiar with Genius Invokation TCG!
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: I hope Kaeya will be alright...
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: Well, now that we are familiar with the rules, why don't we try playing a game of Genius Invokation TCG?
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: Then let's use my cards... These were mixed in with all the others I had received, and I didn't know what they were for at first. But now that we've learned the rules, I can see that this one must be the Sucrose Character Card.
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: Now, it looks like we each have the Kaeya, Diluc, and Sucrose Character Cards. So why don't we have our first duel?
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 07a 1.ogg Sucrose: Alright, let's duel!
Media:vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 07b 1.ogg Sucrose: Take your time, I look forward to our first duel.
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 diona 01.ogg Diona: That's not how the rules work, Sucrose. Don't be a sore loser. That kind of thing is looked down on in TCG circles.
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 diona 02.ogg Diona: ...Uhh, you lost me at "alchemy" and "experiments." But I'm pretty sure it's normal to feel that way.
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 diona 03.ogg Diona: Playing cards is no different. Each game you lose makes you wanna win the next one to settle the score, and the desire to win pushes you to improve your strategy and build a better deck.
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 diona 04.ogg Diona: Hehe! Seizing victory through a winning combination of luck, skill, and experience is where all the fun of Genius Invokation lies!
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 diona 05.ogg Diona: A losing streak... Yeah, that'll definitely get you down. But it's way better to keep trying until you win than to just accept you're a plain old loser and give up!
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 diona 06.ogg Diona: Besides, Sucrose, you're already making great progress. It'd take at least eight of our regular boozehounds to match your level. You played well this last match!
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 diona 07.ogg Diona: Good. Having fun is the main thing. If you ever wanna play again in the future, feel free to come by The Cat's Tail... Ah, but don't expect me to play with you, I just mean this place probably has the right atmosphere...
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 diona 08.ogg Diona: Alright, I think you should have the basics down by now. I need to get back to bartending — Shuyun's likely been busy making this tavern more popular with his delicious cocktails... Phooey, phooey, phooey! And we can't have that.
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 diona 09.ogg Diona: Hmph! Burning Mondstadt's wine industry to the ground keeps me prettay busy, y'know! So if you need any more help, go bother Shuyun!
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Paimon didn't know you could get so competitive, Sucrose.
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: I can't believe I lost when we had the exact same Character Cards... The rules must be more complicated than I first thought.
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Every decision is a difficult trade-off in this game. If there was only a way to transplant the arms of the two standby characters onto the active character's body—
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Oh, I am sorry... I was beaten fair and square, I know that. I just can't stand losing.
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: But it was a fun match.
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: I always get a little upset when I lose.
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: It's like that with my research, too. It always gets to me when my experiments don't go as planned, especially when there's an alchemy genius like Albedo around to compare myself to...
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: ...But what if you keep trying and trying, and never win a single game?
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: Hmm... you make a good point, Diona.
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: Thank you... I'm just a little disappointed to lose, that's all. But Genius Invokation TCG is a really fun game.
Media:vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 10.ogg Sucrose: I'll definitely be back.
Media:vo tips tcg001 2 margaret 01.ogg Margaret: Welcome to The Cat's Tail. Ah, it's (Traveler) and Paimon, what a nice surprise!
Media:vo tips tcg001 2 margaret 02.ogg Margaret: Oh, and Sucrose the alchemist. It's been a while, hasn't it?
Media:vo tips tcg001 2 margaret 03.ogg Margaret: I'm afraid I've already told you before: Fur from The Cat's Tail staff is not for sale, no matter how much Mora you offer.
Media:vo tips tcg001 2 margaret 04.ogg Margaret: Ah, Genius Invokation TCG... We were just talking about that game.
Media:vo tips tcg001 2 margaret 05.ogg Margaret: You see, more and more people have been gathering at The Cat's Tail to play, so I thought: Why not have a dedicated staff to serve the new customers?
Media:vo tips tcg001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh, Sucrose... what kind of experiment were you trying to do at The Cat's Tail?
Media:vo tips tcg001 2 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Heh...
Media:vo tips tcg001 2 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Ah, don't worry, Margaret, we're not here for that research project I told you about last time.
Media:vo tips tcg001 2 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Oh, I just wanted to test out some hypotheses, and I needed some materials... But, uh, we can talk about that later.
Media:vo tips tcg001 2 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: Actually, Margaret, we're here to learn more about Genius Invokation TCG.
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hehehe, that's right! (Traveler), Sucrose, and Paimon are TCG players now!
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh... Paimon picked it up from watching you and Sucrose!
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Same way you can "hear" what Prince says...?
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Ohh, that's right. The soul of an ancient TCG player was trapped inside, right?
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So the Casket of Tomes is actually real?
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Ooh, Paimon can guess what you're gonna say next — the reason they can sense each other is because they have the souls of ancient TCG players inside!
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Darn, what a letdown...
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Alright, now let's see this Casket of Tomes already!
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: So you have to win three duels against three different opponents?
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Oh, Timaeus mentioned it, didn't he? It was from the light novels he's been reading. The thing that the main character found in his attic...
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: But even for (Traveler), that's only two wins in total. What about the last one?
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 01.ogg Shuyun: I see, so you have now grasped the rules of Genius Invokation TCG.
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 02.ogg Shuyun: Meow... "Becoming a TCG player is not as simple as that. You cannot call yourselves true TCG players until you have passed the test."
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 03.ogg Shuyun: Sobering words from Prince there... But I'm afraid he's right. To become official players recognized by the Genius Invokation TCG Society, you have to pass the test.
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 04a 1.ogg Shuyun: Yes, although to be honest, it's not that difficult...
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 04b 1.ogg Shuyun: It's just a tabletop card game. I'm not sure how you would plan on achieving something like that...
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 05.ogg Shuyun: Basically, to become an official and recognized TCG player, you have to best three opponents in a duel.
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 06.ogg Shuyun: Meow... "The duel you just played can count towards this tally..."
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 07.ogg Shuyun: I agree. Although I didn't get to observe the match myself, I did listen along. And from what I could hear, you both performed at a rather high level.
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 08.ogg Shuyun: A well-trained ear is a basic skill expected of anyone hoping to become a TCG master. But back to the matter at hand — (Traveler) only needs to beat two more opponents to become an official TCG player.
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 09.ogg Shuyun: Sucrose, you may have lost the last duel, but don't be disheartened. I can assure you that winning three games is well within your ability.
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 10.ogg Shuyun: Meow... "But first things first, Shuyun. Before that, our TCG newcomers should receive their free gift..."
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 11.ogg Shuyun: Ah yes, my goodness. Completely slipped my mind — I'm lucky to have Prince here to remind me. Everyone who wants to start playing Genius Invokation TCG is entitled to claim a free Casket of Tomes.
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 12.ogg Shuyun: Heh, well... actually, all card cases in Genius Invokation TCG are called Caskets of Tomes. Not only do they provide a reliable and sturdy container to store your decks, they can also sense when other people in the area are also carrying a Casket of Tomes with them—
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 13.ogg Shuyun: That would mean an extraordinarily high number of people in history have been turned into disembodied souls as a consequence of playing card games... No, the real reason that it can sense other Caskets is because it holds a nifty little mechanism invented by Sumeru scholars...
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 14.ogg Shuyun: "Meow! All Caskets of Tomes are issued by Margaret, so you will need to see her to claim yours..."
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 15.ogg Shuyun: Probably for the best. If Prince and I were responsible for handing them out, knowing how eager we both are to promote the game, we'd probably have dished them all out by now...
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 16.ogg Shuyun: Okay, so go and see Margaret to claim your Casket of Tomes, use it to find another player, beat them in a duel, and then come back here.
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 17a.ogg Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 17b.ogg Shuyun: Meow... "I shall choose the final contestant (he/she) must beat in order to become an official TCG player, for it must be one of comparable prowess."
Media:vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 18.ogg Shuyun: Excellent plan, Prince! Happy dueling, both of you.
Media:vo tips tcg001 24 margaret 01.ogg Margaret: Hello you three, has Little Diona finished teaching you the rules of Genius Invokation?
Media:vo tips tcg001 24 margaret 02.ogg Margaret: Ah, I see, you're here for your Casket of Tomes, aren't you? A very useful tool indeed.

Media:vo tips tcg001 24 margaret 03.ogg Margaret: That's right. A purpose-built case for your card deck, that can even detect when someone else nearby is carrying one... Gosh, whoever invented this must have seriously disliked being alone.
Media:vo tips tcg001 24 margaret 04.ogg Margaret: True. So I'm glad that these customers... ahem, TCG players are able to congregate at The Cat's Tail.
Media:vo tips tcg001 24 margaret 05.ogg Margaret: You're not wrong, but that's secondary. The important thing to me is the opportunity for like-minded people to come together and enjoy their favorite hobby. It creates a nice atmosphere... Anyway, now you have your Caskets of Tomes, it's time to find some opponents.
Media:vo tips tcg001 24 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yeah. Well, even the most fun game is pretty lonely if you've got no one else to play it with.
Media:vo tips tcg001 24 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: So this is a Casket of Tomes.
Media:vo tips tcg001 24 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Alright. In that case, I'll go find some people to play against, too. Let's meet back at The Cat's Tail in a while!
Media:vo tips tcg001 24 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Thanks. I'll do my best.
(Obtain Casket of Tomes)
Media:vo tips tcg001 25 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm, there's a player nearby... That way! Let's go see!
Media:vo tips tcg001 26 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Aha, it's you!
Media:vo tips tcg001 26 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We wanna become official Genius Invokation TCG players, but we have to pass the test first, so we need to beat three other players in a duel. Our Casket of Tomes led us to you!
Media:vo tips tcg001 26 swan 01.ogg Swan: ...I'm sorry, is there anything I can assist the two of you with?
Media:vo tips tcg001 26 swan 02.ogg Swan: Oh I see. Unfortunately, I'm on duty right now...
Media:vo tips tcg001 26 swan 03a 1.ogg Swan: ...I see you're serious about this. Very well. As a fellow TCG player, I cannot refuse an earnest invitation to duel.
Media:vo tips tcg001 26 swan 03b 1.ogg Swan: Are you... quoting the Knights of Favonius Handbook at me...?
Media:vo tips tcg001 26 swan 04.ogg Swan: So be it. Then let the duel begin.
Media:vo tips tcg001 29 swan 01.ogg Swan: Gosh, I lost. You're remarkably good at this considering how new to the game you are.
Media:vo tips tcg001 29 swan 02.ogg Swan: Let's play again when you have some time. But... ideally not when I'm on duty...
Media:vo tips tcg001 3 margaret 01.ogg Margaret: Speaking of which, I believe you've already met...
Media:vo tips tcg001 3 margaret 02.ogg Margaret: You know, Prince. This is The Cat's Tail, after all, so I thought having a cat take care of our new customers would be quite a nice touch.
Media:vo tips tcg001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm? Met who?
Media:vo tips tcg001 30 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We did it! Now we have two victories under our belt.
Media:vo tips tcg001 30 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's get back to The Cat's Tail. Paimon wonders, who's Prince gonna pick as our final contestant?
Media:vo tips tcg001 31 fischl 01.ogg ???: What ho, fellow voyager of the stellar void. Yes, even I was briefly discountenanced when I heard the tidings of your sworn oath to become the Thrice Victorious... But so be it! You who are enslaved by dueling desire, be released from your shackles into the glorious arena of gladiatorial combat!
Media:vo tips tcg001 31 fischl 02.ogg ???: Step forth, O brave challenger, your Prinzessin grants you an audience. Hmph, hearken well! The wretched clock chimes yet again, as the declining light of the day grows dimmer still...
Media:vo tips tcg001 31 oz 01.ogg ???: Pardon my directness, but we have not been waiting that long. Mein Fräulein could afford to be a little less impatient.
Media:vo tips tcg001 31 paimon 01a.ogg Media:vo tips tcg001 31 paimon 01b.ogg Paimon: (He/She) won't lose to them, whoever it is! Right, (Traveler)?
Media:vo tips tcg001 31 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh, Paimon knows those voices...
Media:vo tips tcg001 31 suyun 01a.ogg Media:vo tips tcg001 31 suyun 01b.ogg Shuyun: Meow... "I sensed that (Traveler) had what it took to become an official TCG player, but (he/she) has returned to the tavern more quickly than I had expected."
Media:vo tips tcg001 31 suyun 02.ogg Shuyun: Meow... "Defeat the opponent I have arranged for you, and you shall become an official TCG player. I look forward to watching this game immensely."
Media:vo tips tcg001 31 suyun 03.ogg Shuyun: Not just Prince. I can't wait either. Come, your opponent is waiting for you in one of the private rooms.
Media:vo tips tcg001 31 suyun 04.ogg Shuyun: Meow... "Your opponent sounds anxious to begin. Do not delay!"
Media:vo tips tcg001 31 suyun 05.ogg Shuyun: That's what Prince said... Please enter, and enjoy your Genius Invokation TCG duel!
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Who else but the Prinzessin? For as the name of this hallowed rite suggests, only when the wisest of heroes is summoned can the master of cards hope to be crowned the champion.
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: This path is a treacherous one... It must be tread with great caution, for eternal doom and damnation are but one wrong step away at any given moment.
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: That is why none is more suited to appear in this audience chamber than the Prinzessin, whose Auge der Verurteilung des Großen Kaleidophantasmas has witnessed ten thousand battles across three thousand worlds.
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 04.ogg Fischl: Hmph, the Prinzessin needed but a single glance at these mere machinations of mankind to discern their working principles. Thus, with speed and brilliance paralleled by lightning alone do I now arrive here at the gateway to yonder circle of secrets...
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 05.ogg Fischl: Hmph! The Prinzessin herself heeds the call of fate and descends to this realm from the Immernachtreich, yet still you dare to doubt the inevitability of the inevitable. Your stubborn foolishness is contemptible.
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 06.ogg Fischl: Wh— ...I shall not lose, Oz!
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 07.ogg Fischl: What say you, outlander? Do you wish to make an enemy of me, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, who even now begins to strum the strings of fate that shall sound out the Traveler's Requiem?
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 08a 1.ogg Fischl: Then I say it is time to see what you are made of!
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 08b 1.ogg Fischl: Oh, do you? How disappointing. But then again, for one accustomed to the petty burdens of this lowly realm, to challenge the Prinzessin is a load under which most mere mortals would crumble.
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 oz 01.ogg Oz: Indeed, mein Fräulein has watched many games of Genius Invokation TCG, and has gained a solid grasp of the rules. Even in a duel between beginners, it is best that both participants are well-versed in them.
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 oz 02.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein, too, has bested two opponents thus far, and is therefore one step away from becoming an official TCG player.
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 oz 03.ogg Oz: Indeed.
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 oz 04.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein, I implore you to consider less odious turns of phrase, lest you be forced to feast on your words in the fullness of time.
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Paimon knew it, it's Fischl and Oz!
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, is that right...
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, that's true.
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Ahh, this makes sense now. Prince did say that he was gonna pair us with someone of a similar skill level... Guess that means Fischl hasn't been playing that long either!
Media:vo tips tcg001 32 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So there's a lot on the line, huh? Either Fischl or (Traveler) is gonna come out of this duel as an official TCG player...
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Impossible... Ugh, the cursed dragon looms near once more, casting its dark shadow on the slender threads of fate, hiding them from my vision...
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: Traveler... Was even this part of your plan?
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: Hmph. It seems I am forced to admit, fellow voyager of the stellar void, that your... mastery of the cards is second to none.
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 fischl 04.ogg Fischl: To commemorate your glorious ascent to a battlefield beyond this lowly mortal realm, I grant thee an incarnation of my majesty in miniature. As you embark on this ingenious vocation, may you wield it in battle against all your fated foes, that not a single one of them may be left standing.
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 fischl 05.ogg Fischl: 'Tis a mere token of such. To the victor of this splendid duel is a boon of commensurate splendor due.
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 fischl 06.ogg Fischl: Nothing would delight me more. I hereby grant you permission to join me in performing the hallowed rite of Genius Invokation.
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 oz 01.ogg Oz: What a truly ingenious plot, and what an exciting duel to witness.
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 oz 02.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein wishes to give you a Mein Fräulein Character Card.
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yeah! ...Oh, Sucrose, you're back. Does that mean...
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Nice, Sucrose won two as well. Great work!
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wow, it's Fischl's Character Card!
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 paimon 04a 1.ogg Paimon: Probably not... Oh, Paimon bets it's some kind of prize for making it as an official TCG player!
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 paimon 04b 1.ogg Paimon: No card game in the world has a card like that. Paimon bets it's some kind of prize for making it as an official TCG player!
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Let's go get our prize!
(Obtain Fischl (Character Card) ×1)
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Congratulations! You've won three duels now. That makes you an official TCG player!
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Yep, I've won two games so far. When I got back, I heard you were in the middle of your final duel, so I came over to watch.
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Oh, um, excuse me Ma'am, I am also a beginner who has won two games so far. Might I also have the honor of joining you in a duel? If you would be willing, of course.
Media:vo tips tcg001 36 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: One other thing. When I got back, Prince and Shuyun said there was something they needed to give you if you managed to become an official TCG player.
Media:vo tips tcg001 37 littleprince 01.ogg Prince: Meow...
Media:vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 01.ogg Shuyun: Ah, so it WAS you who won the duel in the end. I knew you'd do it! Congratulations, you are now officially recognized members of the Genius Invokation TCG community!
Media:vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 02.ogg Shuyun: Meow... "Very well done. Now, I will explain to you what becoming an official TCG player entails."
Media:vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 03.ogg Shuyun: Meow... "The first thing all new official TCG players receive is their TCG Player's Handbook."
Media:vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 04.ogg Shuyun: This handbook tells you exactly what you need to do to become a top-tier TCG player. Make sure you read it.
Media:vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 05.ogg Shuyun: Secondly, a range of Genius Invokation merchandise is now available to you for purchase here at The Cat's Tail. Hehe, so you see, becoming an official TCG player is really just the first step.
Media:vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 06.ogg Shuyun: Meow... "And thirdly, whenever you wish to play a game with a friend, you can use the Invitation Board there. Whoever you wish to duel against, simply invite them to the tavern for a game."
Media:vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 07.ogg Shuyun: Yes, it's right by the bar counter. Once you get the hang of it, you can play with your friends whenever you want.
Media:vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 08.ogg Shuyun: That's it, really. If there's anything you didn't quite understand, you can always come and ask me.
Media:vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 09.ogg Shuyun: Yes indeed, I'm quite sure they will. ...Oh, sorry, I forgot to translate for you. Prince would like to say:
Media:vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 10.ogg Shuyun: "(Traveler), hope you'll have fun playing Genius Invokation TCG!"
Media:vo tips tcg001 38 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: With three Electro Dice, I summon my eternal familiar, Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, to my side. Heed my invokation!
Media:vo tips tcg001 38 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: I mean in the game, Oz.
Media:vo tips tcg001 38 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: Oh... So be it, one shall not be swayed by such a feeble attack...
Media:vo tips tcg001 38 oz 01.ogg Oz: But mein Fräulein, I have been by your side all along.
Media:vo tips tcg001 38 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Hmm... Then I'll use Chaotic Entropy to invoke a Large Wind Spirit...
Media:vo tips tcg001 38 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: That deals increased damage when it carries an element other than Anemo, so...
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 diona 01.ogg Diona: Yeah, blah blah blah, what is it? I'm pretty busy over here, you know!
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 diona 02.ogg Diona: Hmph, why is it that every player that sets foot in here to play Genius Invokation TCG has to have a drink... Ugh! Don't they have any clue that the key to playing a game is the ability to think straight?
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 diona 03.ogg Diona: Seriously, games and drinks don't mix. Don't they get that? Ugh!
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 diona 04.ogg Diona: Ha, hahah! Yeah! What kind of break is that? I'd rather not, hmph!
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 diona 05.ogg Diona: Oh... why are we letting all these loafers come in here to play Genius Invokation TCG anyway? All it does is encourage more people to come to the bar for a drink...
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 diona 06.ogg Diona: *sigh* Ya know, if drinks sales keep going up like this, pretty soon, Mondstadt's alcohol industry is gonna reach new heights...
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 diona 07.ogg Diona: Grr, looks like my first step in destroying Mondstadt's alcohol industry should be stamping out the spread of Genius Invokation TCG!
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 diona 08.ogg Diona: C—Could it really?
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 diona 09.ogg Diona: Ooo... alright! We'll need some space to learn, heheh. Let's go to that empty table over there.
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 littleprince 01.ogg Prince: Meow.
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 littleprince 02.ogg Prince: Meow...
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 01.ogg Margaret: Hmm... my mistake. So it seems I haven't introduced you yet... This is Prince and Shuyun. They will be in charge of taking care of our "TCG players."
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 02.ogg Margaret: Uh-huh... Anyway, if you'd like to know anything about Genius Invokation TCG, then please ask Shuyun... Uh, who will ask Prince.
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 03.ogg Margaret: Though I'd love to explain more myself, it's time for my daily walk. I'll let Prince play a game with you and walk you through all the rules.
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 04.ogg Margaret: If Prince is unwilling to play, then I guess we should look for an alternative. How about this... Diona!
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 05.ogg Margaret: What can I say... As the tavern owner, I can't help but feel happy to hear this.
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 06.ogg Margaret: Anyway, I see you've been working hard so I thought you could use a break... So why not come over here and teach these customers the rules of Genius Invokation?
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 07.ogg Margaret: Sure, why not. Alrighty then, our two customers are waiting to learn... Shuyun, let's put you on drink-mixing duty for now.
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 08.ogg Margaret: Shuyun. Drink-mixing. Now.
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow, another guy who can understand animals!
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Seriously, how can he get all of that from a simple meow?
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Somehow, Paimon doubts that.
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, PRINCE doesn't wanna play with us, huh? Fine, then Prince doesn't have to. We'll play you instead!
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Hmm, it seems he really is capable of communicating with the cat. Could this be the result of some modification to the language center of his brain?
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: So playing Genius Invokation TCG fosters some sort of a telepathic link between players?
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 01.ogg Shuyun: Ah, allow me to interpret. Ahem, Prince says that the word "customer" is much too loose of a term, and we should instead refer to anyone who loves dueling with cards as "TCG players."
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 02.ogg Shuyun: Ah, I'm afraid I must correct you there, Ma'am. Only Prince, the strongest and most formidable TCG player of all, is capable of providing valuable guidance to our new players.
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 03.ogg Shuyun: The average player is incapable of grasping the subtlety and sheer genius behind Prince's every play, and he has no choice but to rely on me to communicate with everyone. I am merely Prince's lowly assistant, that's all.
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 04.ogg Shuyun: How can you use such a crude word as "animal" to describe the one and only Prince? He is special and the only one of his kind... Such a remark is an insult to Prince!
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 05.ogg Shuyun: Oh? What's that? "Shuyun, in the eyes of the common folk, I look no different than any other ordinary cat. It's a natural mistake to make, and you shouldn't overreact." Ah, understood... I do apologize.
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 06a 1.ogg Shuyun: Yes, it was the sacred duels of Genius Invokation TCG that formed and cemented our bonds of mutual understanding. It's my firm belief that by simply playing the game, players can develop a deeper level of understanding between one another.
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 06b 1.ogg Shuyun: It was the duels of Genius Invokation TCG that allowed our hearts to bond. It's understandable that ordinary people such as yourselves are unable to comprehend such a thing.
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 07.ogg Shuyun: Meow... "Just as a seasoned warrior can foresee the path of his opponent's sword, so too can I, as a TCG master, predict my opponent's every play. It would be improper to pit a newcomer to the art of the card against one such as myself, and I must therefore politely decline."
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 08.ogg Shuyun: Ahem, that's what Prince said.
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 09.ogg Shuyun: I'm sorry, but from the day I met the mighty cardmaster Prince, I swore an oath that my hands would live solely to hold the cards, and not to play them. I will never play another match of my own again.
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 10.ogg Shuyun: Meow... "My dear, you are quite mistaken. You said it yourself — a clear mind is necessary to win. Soon, their thirst for victory will overcome their thirst for alcohol..."
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 11.ogg Shuyun: Prince speaks the truth, Diona. Not only is the spread of Genius Invokation TCG no obstacle to your goal of destroying Mondstadt's alcohol industry, it could even support you in this endeavor!
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 12.ogg Shuyun: Meow... "But Shuyun is destined for a far greater purpose..."
Media:vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 13.ogg Shuyun: O—Okay...
Media:vo tips tcg002 1 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Okay, one Character Card defeated...
Media:vo tips tcg002 2 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Darn... I didn't factor that in to the equation...
Media:vo tips tcg002 3 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Oh... I wasn't expecting that.
Media:vo tips tcg002 4 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: According to the rules, it costs Dice and Energy to unleash an Elemental Burst...
Media:vo tips tcg002 5 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Hahaha, now see what happens to those who dare defy the Prinzessin!
Media:vo tips tcg002 6 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: This is but a small sacrifice, necessary to achieve ultimate victory.
Media:vo tips tcg002 7 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Ah, what happened... Oz! With lightning twixt upper and lower mandible, strike thy pointy beak into this obstacle, and remove it from my path!
Media:vo tips tcg002 7 oz 01.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein, I cannot simply attack the Traveler!
Media:vo tips tcg002 8 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Hmph! As the cryptic chronicles of fate have prophesized, so do I command: In the name of the Prinzessin, deal your almighty final blow, and bring all that moves in the heavens to an everlasting standstill!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 01.ogg Diona: Haha! Welcome — welcome to the world of Genius Invokation TCG!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 02.ogg Diona: Simply put, this is a game where you control Character Cards to duke it out with your opponent! Pew pew pew!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 03.ogg Diona: Once you've defeated all of your opponent's Character Cards, victory shall be yours!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 04.ogg Diona: Now then, you're gonna need a character on the field to start with.
Select Diluc as your first active character
Confirm your selection
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 05.ogg Diona: First, we roll 8 Elemental Dice at the start of every Round.
(The player rolls two Omni Dice, four Pyro Dice, one Hydro Die, and one Electro Die)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 06.ogg Diona: These dice correspond to elemental energy! We'll be spending these dice to perform actions!
Confirm your roll results
(Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl's Flowfire Edge activates)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 07.ogg Diona: Once the Roll Phase is over, you will enter the Action Phase, where the real game starts!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 08.ogg Diona: During the Action Phase, you can spend Elemental Dice to perform various actions.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 09.ogg Diona: Of course, the most common action is to use Character Skills!
Select Diluc's Elemental Skill
Diluc's Elemental Skill will cost 3 Pyro Dice. After selecting the Skill, you will select the Elemental Dice that must be spent by default.
Searing Onslaught can deal 3 Pyro DMG.
Use Searing Onslaught against the opponent's active character
(Diluc uses Searing Onslaught on Diona's Hilichurl Fighter)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 10.ogg Diona: Heh, not bad. You just made your first attack.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 11.ogg Diona: During the Action Phase, both sides will take turns making their moves.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 12.ogg Diona: After you use a Skill to attack your opponent, it's their turn to attack.
(Diona opponent's Hilichurl Fighter uses Jump and Hit on Diluc)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 13.ogg Diona: And as you can see, once the enemy finishes their move, it's our turn again.
Attack using your Elemental Skill again
We have 2 Omni Dice amongst our rolls.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 14.ogg Diona: Now, these are Omni Element Dice. They can be spent on any move, regardless of the elemental type!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 15.ogg Diona: So we're gonna use them to pay for the Pyro Dice needed for this Skill. Go on, give it a try.
You can also click the Skill button again to use the Skill
(Diluc uses Searing Onslaught on the Hilichurl Fighter and defeats it)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 16.ogg Diona: Haha, that was pretty good. That's one opponent down for the count! Kabam!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 17.ogg Diona: But the game has only just begun, remember? You have to defeat all opponents to win.
(Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl uses Du Plama on Diluc)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 18.ogg Diona: Hmm, as much as we'd like to attack again, seems like we've run out of usable dice...
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 19.ogg Diona: Hmph. In that case, let's end this round!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 20.ogg Diona: After you End Round, you won't be able to do anything else this Round.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 21.ogg Diona: And once everyone chooses End Round... We can move on to the next Round.
End Round
Confirm the end of your actions
(Diona declares the end of her Round)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 22.ogg Diona: Alright! Here we are, a fresh new Round, woohoo!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 23.ogg Diona: And a fresh new Round means time to roll the dice again! That's how we're gonna get the elemental energy we need, after all.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 24.ogg Diona: Ew, that's some terrible luck. There's no way we'll be able to use Diluc's skill now...
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 25.ogg Diona: But don't worry! Situations like these are why we have the option to Reroll! Haha!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 26.ogg Diona: Once per Round, you can select all the dice that you don't like and Reroll them.
Select all the non-Pyro Dice
After selecting the dice you want to reroll, click the button to reroll them
(The player now has two Omni Dice, three Pyro Dice, and three Hydro Dice)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 27.ogg Diona: When the Action Phase begins, the player who first chose End Round in the previous round takes their turn first.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 28.ogg Diona: This means that since you finished first the last Round, you will be the first to start this Round.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 29.ogg Diona: Alrighty then. Let's learn a little bit about Energy and Elemental Bursts!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 30.ogg Diona: Each time you use a Skill, your Character will gain 1 Energy.
Last Round, we used 2 Skills, which means that we have obtained 2 Energy.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 31.ogg Diona: Once Diluc's Energy is full, he can use a powerful Elemental Burst. But we're still one short...
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 32.ogg Diona: Never mind, let's start with a Normal Attack instead.
Use a Normal Attack
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 33.ogg Diona: Diluc's Normal Attack only needs 1 Pyro Die and 2 other dice of any type.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 34.ogg Diona: In any case, your Normal Attack needs fewer Pyro Dice than your Elemental Skill.
You can also click the Skill button again to use the Skill
(Diluc uses Tempered Sword on Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl)
Just like Elemental Skills, Normal Attacks grant 1 Energy after using them.
(Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl uses Upa on Diluc)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 35.ogg Diona: Hehe, now we have 3 Energy — plus, we have enough Pyro Elemental Dice left over.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 36.ogg Diona: It's time to use your powerful Elemental Burst!
Use Diluc's Elemental Burst
The Elemental Burst, Dawn, can deal a whopping 8 DMG. Use it to finish off your final opponent and claim victory!
Use your Elemental Burst to wipe out your opponent!
(Diluc uses Dawn on the Blazing Axe Mitachurl and defeats it)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 37.ogg Diona: In an actual game of Genius Invokation TCG, you need to use multiple Character Cards to form a party.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 38.ogg Diona: Next up, it's time for your second Character Card, Kaeya, to take the stage!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 39.ogg Diona: Huh... It seems like any move by Kaeya is gonna cost quite a lot of Cryo Dice...
Select all non-Cryo and non-Pyro Dice
Reroll selected dice
(The player now has one Omni Die, three Cryo Dice, two Pyro Dice, and two Hydro Dice)
(Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl's Flowfire Edge activates)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 40.ogg Diona: When you deal Cryo DMG, you will cause your target to be affected by Cryo.
Now then, use Frostgnaw to apply Cryo to your opponent!
(Kaeya uses Frostgnaw on Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl)
(Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl uses Upa on Kaeya)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 41.ogg Diona: Good. Now our opponent is affected by Cryo. This is a good time to learn about Elemental Reactions!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 42.ogg Diona: Different types of Elemental Damage affect enemies with different Elements. When a character is affected by certain elemental combos...
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 43.ogg Diona: An Elemental Reaction will be triggered!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 44.ogg Diona: At the moment, your opponent is affected by Cryo, so we should try and use a Pyro Skill on them... Looks like we have to switch active characters, though.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 45.ogg Diona: Oh! That reminds me... Both sides must have one active character, while others are considered standby characters.
Active characters will be in a more forward position compared to ones on standby.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 46.ogg Diona: Normally, we can only use the active character's Skills.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 47.ogg Diona: Now, if we want to use the Skills of our standby character, we'll have to switch them to the active character.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 48.ogg Diona: In this case, we'll have to switch to Diluc in order to use his Skills...
Select Diluc
Activate the Switch Character action
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 49.ogg Diona: You can spend 1 Elemental Die of any kind to switch a standby character to the active character.
Spend 1 Hydro Die to switch your active character to Diluc
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 50.ogg Diona: Switching characters is an action, just like using a Skill, so once it's done, it's your opponent's turn.
(Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl uses Du Plama on Diluc)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 51.ogg Diona: Most Skills can only target the active character. As you can see, your opponent just attacked Diluc.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 52.ogg Diona: Alright then. Now that Diluc is our active character, it's time to use his Skill!
Select Diluc's Elemental Skill
Unlike Kaeya's Elemental Skill, Diluc's will deal Pyro DMG.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 53.ogg Diona: Because the opponent is already affected by Cryo, dealing Pyro DMG triggers the "Melt" Elemental Reaction.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 54.ogg Diona: When triggered, Melt increases DMG dealt by 2!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 55.ogg Diona: This will allow you to deal loads of damage in one go! Haha! Genius Invokation's Elemental Reaction system is pretty cool, huh?
Now, use an Elemental Reaction to defeat your opponent!
(Diluc uses Searing Onslaught on Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl and defeats it)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 56.ogg Diona: Alright, haha. Next up, let's learn how to use card types other than Character Cards.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 57.ogg Diona: These Cards are all known as Action Cards.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 58.ogg Diona: Each time a match starts, you have to draw 5 Action Cards to form your starting hand.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 59.ogg Diona: Uh-oh, looks like we don't have any Elemental Dice we can spend to make an attack...
Guess we'll just have to reroll them all!
Reroll all Elemental Dice
(The player now has two Geo Dice, two Dendro Dice, two Dendro Dice, one Hydro Die, and one Electro Die)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 60.ogg Diona: Seriously!? We still don't have any usable dice even after that reroll?
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 61.ogg Diona: ...Well, never mind. Even in cases like this, we can still attack — we just need to put the Action Cards in our hand to good use!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 62.ogg Diona: Don't underestimate Action Cards! They can grant all kinds of support and buffs to your Active Character. Take this one, for example...
Expand Hand
Select White Iron Greatsword
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 63.ogg Diona: So playing this Action Card will require 2× . See this  symbol? Yeah, that means you'll need to play Elemental Dice of the same type.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 64.ogg Diona: Some other Cards will cost you  instead. The cost requirements for  are much more lenient. You can spend any kind of Elemental Dice.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 65.ogg Diona: We'll cross that bridge when we get there, though. For now, just play this Action Card.
Drag this card onto the field to play it
We need to spend 2 Elemental Dice of the same type to pay the cost shown here.
Spend two Dice to equip this weapon
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 66.ogg Diona: So, playing an Action Card from your hand is a form of Fast Action. Fast Actions do not end your current turn.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 67.ogg Diona: Simply put, you can even continue to act even after playing an Action Card. Well then, you have your blade. Time to test it out!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 68.ogg Diona: But wait... Diluc's Elemental Skill costs 3 Pyro Dice, and right now, we don't even have 1...
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 69.ogg Diona: Not a problem! This is where we can use a more advanced mechanic known as Elemental Tuning.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 70.ogg Diona: By discarding one card from your hand, you can convert one Elemental Die into the element of your current active character!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 71.ogg Diona: And this card isn't useful right now, so we might as well use it for Elemental Tuning.
Select Magic Guide
Drag this card to the Elemental Dice Zone to use it to conduct Elemental Tuning
Tune 1 Elemental Die to turn it into Pyro, Diluc's Element
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 72.ogg Diona: Sometimes, you won't be able to perform any actions you want to, because you didn't roll the Elemental Dice you wanted. Oh well, moving on.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 73.ogg Diona: In Genius Invokation TCG, keeping up a constant flow of combat is much more important than the number of cards you have.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 74.ogg Diona: In this case, well... Let's just take all these useless cards and use them for Elemental Tuning!
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 75.ogg Diona: Just like playing cards from your hand, Elemental Tuning is a Fast Action.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 76.ogg Diona: C'mon, hurry up. Use Elemental Tuning to get yourself 3 Pyro Dice!
Select Raven Bow
Drag this card to the Elemental Dice Zone to use it to conduct Elemental Tuning
Tune 1 Elemental Die to get a Pyro Die that matches your active character
Select White Tassel
Drag this card to the Elemental Dice Zone to use it to conduct Elemental Tuning
Tune 1 Elemental Die to get 1 Pyro Die
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 77.ogg Diona: Well, well, well, would you look at that? Finally, we now have enough Elemental Dice to use Searing Onslaught.
Collapse Hand
Select Diluc's Elemental Skill
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 78.ogg Diona: Because you have the White Iron Greatsword equipped, Searing Onslaught will deal 1 extra DMG. What!?
Luckily, that's just enough to defeat your opponent!
(Diluc uses Searing Onslaught on Diona's Hilichurl Berserker and defeats it)
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 79.ogg Diona: Now comes the final part! Booyah! In a real match, you can make adjustments to your initial hand.
Media:vo tips tcg002 9 diona 80.ogg Diona: At this time, we can select any number of cards in our hand to shuffle back into the Draw Pile, and then draw the same number of new cards. Whaat?
