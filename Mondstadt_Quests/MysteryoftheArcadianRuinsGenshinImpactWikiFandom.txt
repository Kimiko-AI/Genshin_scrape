 Crabs?
Media:vo kylq002 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Giant crabs!
Media:vo kylq002 5 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Aside from asking just where we would find giant crabs...
Media:vo kylq002 5 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Crabs have eight legs, not six...
 The windmills, then?
 Hmm... Maybe it's when the water level of the clear spring changes?
 Let's go to the treasure location directly!
Media:vo kylq003 1 paimon 04b.ogg Paimon: You read my mind! Paimon's so happy!
 Let's report to Kaeya first.
Media:vo kylq003 1 paimon 04a.ogg Paimon: Hmm? Paimon believes that there is no need!
 Maybe when there are people bathing in the spring water?
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Such inappropriate behavior... I feel like it has been creeping into Mondstadt for quite a while now.
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Unless... that's something you two get up to?
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Oh, my apologies. I shouldn't judge what one does in their own time.
Media:vo kylq002 7 paimon 04a.ogg Paimon: What's wrong with you? What kind of people do you think we are?
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Haha. The thing is, if the "rushing passion" isn't coming from the clear spring, then it's coming from the people bathing.
 Hmm... Maybe it's when the water level of the clear spring changes?
 Quest DescriptionAccording to Kaeya, his pirate grandfather left behind a treasured sword that has been buried in the Lost Arcadian Ruins. To prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, you search high and low for intelligence regarding the ruins.
 Really?
Media:vo kylq002 3 vile 06.ogg Vile: Well, you did save my life.
 Should be... the windmills?
 Sure thing.
 Sure... I hope.
 Thank you, friend.
 Thanks for the help, Kaeya.
 The windmills, then?
 When the water level changes?
 You never had any to begin with...
Media:vo dialog kylq002 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: If I'm right, the location described by the clue is the windmill the furthest away from the statue... I'm not completely certain though.
Media:vo dialog kylq002 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Take a look around the waterfall near Springvale. Remember to bring a friend who can manipulate Cryo. Huh? Oh... Me?
Media:vo dialog kylq002 vile 01.ogg Vile: "Three six-armed giants reside in the city in the lake. Two guard the statue, one, the treasure." Got it?
Media:vo kylq002 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Look, (Traveler)! She's in trouble!
Media:vo kylq002 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Him, who?
Media:vo kylq002 3 paimon 02a.ogg Media:vo kylq002 3 paimon 02b.ogg Paimon: It's nothing. (He/She)'s a traveler, (he/she) has to deal with stuff like this all the time.
Media:vo kylq002 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, so you're the...
Media:vo kylq002 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: LUCKY!
Media:vo kylq002 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: But... it's lucky for Kaeya, isn't it? He's supposed to pay for the intel...
Media:vo kylq002 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Right... Wait, is that it?
Media:vo kylq002 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Could... this be the X-marks-the-spot?
Media:vo kylq002 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: So the clue is more like a riddle...
Media:vo kylq002 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Well, should be a piece of cake for ya, right (Traveler)? Paimon'll leave it to you then!
Media:vo kylq002 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Well, if you can't solve it, we can ask Kaeya. He seems like a nerd too.
Media:vo kylq002 3 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Thanks, Vile.
Media:vo kylq002 3 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: "Three six-armed giants reside in the city in the lake. Two guard the statue, one, the treasure."
Media:vo kylq002 3 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: What does that mean? If you don't wanna ask Kaeya, you better figure it out!
Media:vo kylq002 3 vile 01.ogg Vile: Why is this happening to me? I shouldn't have helped him...
Media:vo kylq002 3 vile 02.ogg Vile: Thanks so much for saving me! You're far more reliable than those Favonius guys.
Media:vo kylq002 3 vile 03.ogg Vile: Traveler? I've heard stories about you. I didn't think I'd be saved by the one I'm here to meet.
Media:vo kylq002 3 vile 04.ogg Vile: Hahaha... I didn't know how I could pay you back initially, but now, I think I'll just give you the intel for free.
Media:vo kylq002 3 vile 05.ogg Vile: People in our circle know how important the network is.
Media:vo kylq002 3 vile 06.ogg Vile: Well, you did save my life.
Media:vo kylq002 3 vile 07.ogg Vile: Listen well then, the intel on the Arcadian Ruins...
Media:vo kylq002 3 vile 08.ogg Vile: "Three six-armed giants reside in the city in the lake. Two guard the statue, one, the treasure."
Media:vo kylq002 3 vile 09.ogg Vile: There's also this map that came with it.
Media:vo kylq002 3 vile 10.ogg Vile: I'll leave you the intel so you can review it at any time.
Media:vo kylq002 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ooh, lemme see what's inside!
Media:vo kylq002 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: "She doesn't love him at all. The passion rushing through the clear spring is just a front. When she's cold and alone, her true heart is revealed."
Media:vo kylq002 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: There's another map.
Media:vo kylq002 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: More riddles?
Media:vo kylq002 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Paimon's dizzy already. Oh, no! Paimon used up all her brain juice!
Media:vo kylq002 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Paimon'll let you have all the fun. Or, you could get Kaeya to help.
Media:vo kylq002 5 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Traveler! You're back! Looks like you got the intel.
Media:vo kylq002 5 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Riddles? How quaint. Let me think...
Media:vo kylq002 5 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: "City in the lake" is clearly Mondstadt... As for the Six-Armed Giants... Hm...
Media:vo kylq002 5 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Aside from asking just where we would find giant crabs...
Media:vo kylq002 5 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Crabs have eight legs, not six...
Media:vo kylq002 5 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Hey! That's smart!
Media:vo kylq002 5 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: A windmill has six blades... It fits.
Media:vo kylq002 5 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: So, out of the three windmills, two are close to the statue...
Media:vo kylq002 5 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: The other one is guarding...
Media:vo kylq002 5 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: Hehehe... Let's hope it's really that simple.
Media:vo kylq002 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yes and no. It's a lot more complicated than that.
Media:vo kylq002 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: "Three six-armed giants reside in the city in the lake. Two guard the statue, one, the treasure." What do you make of it?
Media:vo kylq002 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Giant crabs!
Media:vo kylq002 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wow! That makes sense!
Media:vo kylq002 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Ooh! Ooh! This one Paimon knows! The treasure!
Media:vo kylq002 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Come on, (Traveler)! Let's go take a look around that windmill!
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: "She doesn't love him at all. The passion rushing through the clear spring is just a front. When she's cold and alone, her true heart is revealed."
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Is this some page stripped from a love novel that you just happened to find?
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Hahaha... I'm just joking.
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Haha, this riddle is hard to figure out. Clear spring... Is it referring to Springvale?
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: "Passion rushing through the clear spring..." So when does passion rush through a clear spring?
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Such inappropriate behavior... I feel like it has been creeping into Mondstadt for quite a while now.
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Unless... that's something you two get up to?
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Oh, my apologies. I shouldn't judge what one does in their own time.
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Haha. The thing is, if the "rushing passion" isn't coming from the clear spring, then it's coming from the people bathing.
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: Not a bad idea! Like when... there's a waterfall, for example...
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: It appears the solution to this enigma related to the waterfall behind Springvale.
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Only the clear spring that blesses Mondstadt can reveal the passion described here.
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: And the "heart" of the waterfall must refer to the cliff on the left side of the waterfall. I noticed it once when I was out on patrol in the area.
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: The ending, "cold and alone," probably has something to do with Cryo, which can be controlled by a Vision.
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: You should probably take someone who can manipulate Cryo with you.
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: It's nothing. If a Knight of Favonius couldn't even answer a riddle, how could we be trusted to solve criminal mysteries?
Media:vo kylq002 7 kaeya 17.ogg Kaeya: Erm...
Media:vo kylq002 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Any idea what that means?
Media:vo kylq002 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, so it's not a clue. No wonder someone as clever as Paimon wasn't able to get it.
Media:vo kylq002 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmph... Take this more seriously, Kaeya!
Media:vo kylq002 7 paimon 04a.ogg Paimon: What's wrong with you? What kind of people do you think we are?
Media:vo kylq002 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Let's go take a look in Springvale. We'll leave you to your "criminal mysteries"!
Media:vo kylq002 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: No, wait... Leave you to SOLVING your criminal mysteries!
Media:vo kylq003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: This time, the mysteries have all been solved, it sure took a lot of work.
Media:vo kylq003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: But in all fairness, this treasure map really is terrible... It looks like it was drawn by a pirate...
Media:vo kylq003 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So now...
Media:vo kylq003 1 paimon 04a.ogg Paimon: Hmm? Paimon believes that there is no need!
Media:vo kylq003 1 paimon 04b.ogg Paimon: You read my mind! Paimon's so happy!
Media:vo kylq003 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Let's go for it! Don't want anyone else to get there before we do!
Media:vo kylq003 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Like... like the Treasure Hoarders Kaeya told us about.
Media:vo kylq003 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Anyways, Paimon just wants to borrow the sword to...
Media:vo kylq003 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: No, you heard nothing! Paimon ah— Paimon just wants to see it!
Media:vo kylq003 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Definitely not to become super, mega, powerful and do nothing but play...
Media:vo kylq003 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Hehe... Alright, Paimon'll save the chit-chat for later.
Media:vo kylq003 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Arcadian treasure hunt, here we go!
