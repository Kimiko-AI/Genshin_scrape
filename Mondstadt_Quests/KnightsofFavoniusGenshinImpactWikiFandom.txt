 Are all the knights as... "strict" as Amber?
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 qin 02b 1.ogg Jean: I heard you and Outrider Amber had a misunderstanding.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 qin 02b 2.ogg Jean: Please forgive her. She was just doing her job.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 qin 02b 3.ogg Jean: Talk to Amber sometime. I'm sure you'll like how energetic she always is.
 Goodbye.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 ambor 02c.ogg Amber: Let's all do our best to defeat Stormterror!
 Goodbye.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 kaeya 02c.ogg Kaeya: See you later then.
 Goodbye.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 lisa 02c.ogg Lisa: Heading out? See you in a bit.
 Goodbye.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 qin 02c.ogg Jean: Thanks again for your help, (Traveler).
 Guess we leave it up to you then. Where's the inn?
Media:vo mdaq025 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hey! Don't be such a slug! We should be a part of this too!
 How do we fight Stormterror?
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 lisa 02b 1.ogg Lisa: A way to fight against Stormterror...
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 lisa 02b 2.ogg Lisa: I'm sorry, but there's no way to do it alone.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 lisa 02b 3.ogg Lisa: Judging by the level of its Anemo power, it's definitely not an ordinary creature.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 lisa 02b 4.ogg Lisa: I could teach you some elemental basics, so you'll have an idea of what I'm talking about.
 How do we fight Stormterror?
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 qin 02a 1.ogg Jean: Its change in size and power really is suspicious.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 qin 02a 2.ogg Jean: But for the Knights of Favonius, our priority is to deal with the aftermath of this attack.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 qin 02a 3.ogg Jean: The Grand Master entrusted the Knights of Favonius to me. I cannot let him or the people of Mondstadt down.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 qin 02a 4.ogg Jean: I must get to the bottom of this...
 How'd you get your eye patch?
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 kaeya 02a 1.ogg Kaeya: My eye patch? Wanna hear my story, eh?
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 kaeya 02a 2.ogg Kaeya: I didn't have time to introduce myself properly... Well, it wasn't on my mind to begin with.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 kaeya 02a 3.ogg Kaeya: Ehe... My apologies. I'm Kaeya, Cavalry Captain for the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 kaeya 02a 4.ogg Kaeya: We can talk more after we get things sorted.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 kaeya 02a 5.ogg Kaeya: I know a great place more fit for a chat.
 I really should help out as well.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Paimon will help too!
 I'd like to know more about monsters.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 lisa 02a 1.ogg Lisa: The monsters out in the wild? We've got many resources here in the library.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 lisa 02a 2.ogg Lisa: Making good use of elemental advantages is the key to winning any battle.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 lisa 02a 3.ogg Lisa: By the way, would you be interested in having a part-time job here?
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 lisa 02a 4.ogg Lisa: We need people to... need people for doing... We just need more people.
 It must be a local thing...
 Jean seems to be pretty reliable.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 ambor 02a 1.ogg Amber: With Jean by our side, nothing can stand in our way! ...At least, that's what I wanna say...
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 ambor 02a 2.ogg Amber: But I can't keep spouting that same old line.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 ambor 02a 3.ogg Amber: She always dashes headlong into the heat of the battle, and we want her to take better care of herself.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 ambor 02a 4.ogg Amber: I really hope that one day I can look Jean in the eye and tell her she doesn't need to worry anymore, because we have her back...
 Quest DescriptionYou repelled Stormterror with some difficulty. Kaeya of the Knights of Favonius witnessed the battle, and you were invited to make a trip to the Knights headquarters.
 We'll ask later...
 Why is Jean the Acting Grand Master?
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 kaeya 02b 1.ogg Kaeya: The Grand Master is currently off leading an expedition, so the Master, Jean, has stepped in to oversee the Knights while he's gone.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 kaeya 02b 2.ogg Kaeya: Hence, you'll hear many refer to her as the Acting Grand Master.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 kaeya 02b 3.ogg Kaeya: When the Grand Master left, he took the vast majority of our knights with him, leaving the Acting Grand Master with far more responsibility and stress.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 kaeya 02b 4.ogg Kaeya: Come to think of it, it must have been difficult for Jean.
 You seem pretty good with a wind glider.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 ambor 02b 1.ogg Amber: As a novice within the Knights of Favonius, your understanding of the wind is absolutely crucial.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 ambor 02b 2.ogg Amber: Leave the advanced wind glider training to me!
Jean: Thank you for accepting our invitation, traveler.
Lisa: I'm Lisa, the librarian. Do you need anything, cutie?
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Wanna team up with me? Huh, I should warn you though, I don't slow down for anyone, greenhorn or otherwise.
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 ambor 02a 1.ogg Amber: With Jean by our side, nothing can stand in our way! ...At least, that's what I wanna say...

Media:vo dialog mdaq025 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: You're not bad with that wind glider. Your gliding style seems familiar...
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 kaeya 02a 1.ogg Kaeya: My eye patch? Wanna hear my story, eh?
Media:vo dialog mdaq025 kaeya 02a 2.ogg Kaeya: I didn't have time to introduce myself properly... Well, it wasn't on my mind to begin with.

Media:vo mdaq025 2 cs kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Jean, I've brought them.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 cs lisa 01.ogg ???: Jean, what's the hurry? I thought we agreed to meet them here.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 cs lisa 02.ogg ???: Relax. I'll lend a hand when the time comes.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 cs qin 02.ogg Jean: There have been sightings of Stormterror outside the city. Once we meet, we must...
Media:vo mdaq025 2 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: ...And once it was over I brought them straight here.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Good. In that case we need a plan.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Is that so?
Media:vo mdaq025 2 lisa 01.ogg Lisa: Oh! Are you sweeties here to help us out?
Media:vo mdaq025 2 lisa 02.ogg Lisa: You're both so adorable!
Media:vo mdaq025 2 lisa 03.ogg Lisa: Sadly, the timing is regrettable...
Media:vo mdaq025 2 lisa 04.ogg Lisa: Stormterror has caused quite a ruckus in the region since its recent resurgence.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 lisa 05.ogg Lisa: Simply put, Mondstadt's elemental sphere and ley lines are now akin to a yarn ball in the paws of a kitten.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 lisa 06.ogg Lisa: For a mage, it couldn't get much worse. My skin is one elemental particle away from a full-blown breakout.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 lisa 07.ogg Lisa: They're located in the abandoned Four Winds' Temples.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 lisa 08.ogg Lisa: Stormterror's ability to whip up these kinds of storms can be attributed to it drawing power from the temples.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Paimon will help too!
Media:vo mdaq025 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hey! Don't be such a slug! We should be a part of this too!
Media:vo mdaq025 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Paimon doesn't.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 qin 01.ogg Jean: Mondstadt welcomes you, windborne travelers.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 qin 02.ogg Jean: I am Jean, Acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius. This is Lisa, our resident Librarian.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 qin 03.ogg Jean: If it weren't for this interference, the Knights of Favonius would have better ways to help you than just putting up missing person posters.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 qin 04a.ogg Media:vo mdaq025 2 qin 04b.ogg Jean: We simply ask that you repose in Mondstadt while we help you seek out your (sister/brother).
Media:vo mdaq025 2 qin 05.ogg Jean: With Stormterror now directly attacking Mondstadt, we may have an opportunity to cut this problem off at the source.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 qin 06.ogg Jean: Lisa has revealed the sources of Stormterror's power with her detection magic.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 qin 07.ogg Jean: Our objective is to deal with three of the four temples.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 qin 08.ogg Jean: I trust everyone understands why we are only dealing with three.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 qin 09.ogg Jean: Knights of Favonius, time is against us.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 qin 10.ogg Jean: The storm is rampant. There is no point in maintaining a defensive position.
Media:vo mdaq025 2 qin 11.ogg Jean: Alright. We need to take initiative and act before the situation escalates.
