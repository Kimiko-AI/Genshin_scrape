 After you've got your gliding license, sure!
Nora: Gliding license? What's that? It sounds complicated...
 For sure!
Nora: Woohoo! I'm gonna grow up as fast as possible, then, when daddy's finished his work, he can play with me!
 I guess I can do that...
Nora: Yay, thanks!
Nora: Go and distract Aunty Grace for a minute, I'll go up right now...
(Grace walks over)
Grace: Nora! No!
Grace: Phew, I look away for one second and she starts bothering you. I do apologize.
Nora: Whyyy! I just wanna play up there for a little bit...
Grace: No means no! Your father would not approve either.
Grace: And you — please refrain from indulging her! People would be just as worried about you if you did something so dangerous.
(Grace leaves)
Nora: Wah...
 It's much too dangerous.
Nora: It'll be fine, I'm really good at climbing!
(The rest is the same as the above response)
 Quest DescriptionNora wants to play on top of the statue, but Sister Grace forbids her to...
 Sure, I'll show you how.
Nora: Hee-hee, yay! I'll just stand by and watch, I'm sure I'm allowed to do that.
 What do you want to do up there?
 What's wrong?
 You wanna glide with me?
Nora: No way! Aunty Grace would go mad if she saw me doing that.
Grace: And you — please refrain from indulging her! People would be just as worried about you if you did something so dangerous.
Grace: No means no! Your father would not approve either.
Grace: Nora! No!
Grace: Phew, I look away for one second and she starts bothering you. I do apologize.
Nora: And the higher you throw it into the wind from, the faster your message will get there...
Nora: Aunty Grace says that if you want to tell someone a secret, you just need to tell it to a dandelion then throw it to the wind... The Anemo Archon will carry the dandelion seeds and the secret you told it to the person you want.
Nora: But Aunty Grace won't let me do it. She says that I can go back and live with daddy when I've grown up.
Nora: But maybe it's easier for grown-ups.
Nora: Gliding license? What's that? It sounds complicated...
Nora: Go and distract Aunty Grace for a minute, I'll go up right now...
Nora: Go! Go! Go! Give it all you've got!
Nora: Hee-hee, yay! I'll just stand by and watch, I'm sure I'm allowed to do that.
Nora: Hmm, what to do...
Nora: I have a secret to tell daddy, and I already got a dandelion.
Nora: I wanna go play up there... But Grace won't let me climb the statue.
Nora: I wish there was a way to grow up faster... I'm trying as hard as I can, but I'm still so short...
Nora: It'll be fine, I'm really good at climbing!
Nora: No way! Aunty Grace would go mad if she saw me doing that.
Nora: Oh yeah— I always see you gliding around in the city. Can you teach me? How do you do it?
Nora: Please can you go and talk to Grace for a bit? Don't let her look this way. I climb really quickly, I'll be up there in no time...
Nora: Quick, take it... Also, don't tell Aunty Grace!
Nora: See the Anemo Archon statue? Now, look up there, the really high bit... where the archon's hands are.
Nora: Thank you. Here, this is a present for you. It's some treasure that I collected in secret.
Nora: This one time, Glory got an adventurer to climb up the statue and throw some dandelion seeds into the wind for her. Just a few days later, Godwin wrote her a letter back!
Nora: Wah...
Nora: Whyyy! I just wanna play up there for a little bit...
Nora: Woohoo! I'm gonna grow up as fast as possible, then, when daddy's finished his work, he can play with me!
Nora: Wooow! When I'm bigger, will I be able to glide like that?
Nora: Yay, thanks!
Paimon: Easy!
Paimon: Er... Paimon wouldn't stand there if Paimon was you...
Paimon: Nora's already made it there... Looks like it's all over.
