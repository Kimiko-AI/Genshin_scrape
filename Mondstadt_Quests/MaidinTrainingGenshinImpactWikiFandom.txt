 "Chivalric Training"?
 ...Mm-hmm...?
 A maid is a respectable position too, I'd like to become one.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: Huh? Y—You're joking hehehe... right?
 A true knight also needs sufficient rest.
 And speaking of tea, let's have some!
 Back soon.
 Besides, you don't exactly mind such tasks, right?
 Can you show me?
 Go back to Mondstadt and see if there are people who need help.
 I can get them back for you.
 I'm constantly running errands.
 If you're too busy, you won't have time to reflect on your progress and goals.
 In Lisa's case, I'm afraid it's probably just resting for the sake of resting...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 52.ogg Noelle: Huh... Now that you... mention it...
 Never mind. Speaking of tea, let's have some!
 Is this... "maid-knight" attire?
 Knightly exercises?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 32.ogg Noelle: Y'know, just basic strength and endurance training...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 33.ogg Noelle: 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 34.ogg Noelle: And running two laps around Mondstadt as a morning routine.
 Maidly duties?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 28.ogg Noelle: Uh... it's really all just cleaning and tidying...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 29.ogg Noelle: Roughly every other day, I do a major clean-up for the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 30.ogg Noelle: Under the beds, the windowsills... nothing can be left out. The smallest corners are the most likely to gather dust.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 31.ogg Noelle: There are also all kinds of smaller domestic tasks, like preparing Captain Kaeya's eye patch, and helping Ms. Lisa keep her bookshelves in order.
 Never mind. Speaking of tea, let's have some!
 No matter how small the tasks, they still need someone to take care of them. I do small tasks all the time.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: Really? Even the Honorary Knight?
 Noelle, can we talk for a moment?
 Not a trace.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 02.ogg Alois: Uh, perhaps the monsters ate it?
 Of course, where do you want to start?
(Go to Branch 2)
 Of course, where do you want to start?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 25.ogg Noelle: I—I'd like to get your opinion on something, as a senior knight!
 Only saw a few monsters...
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 03.ogg Alois: So there were monsters...
 Quest DescriptionIn accordance with your growing fame as the Honorary Knight, one of your junior Knights of Favonius would like to receive your guidance...
 Quest DescriptionNoelle, who aims to become a Knight of Favonius, has shared her troubles with you and hopes that you'll be able to help her with her chivalric training. At your suggestion, Noelle decides to start small...
 Stopping for occasional rest is all part of ensuring that you can train to your maximum ability.
 The Knights of Favonius have... maids?
 The strength to fight powerful enemies only comes with the experience gained during the completion of smaller tasks.
 They were only a few slimes.
 They weren't exactly twice your height.
 Think of every small task as a kind of training.
 This fellow seems suspicious to me.
 Twice or thrice...?
 What you lack is rest.
 What you lack is rest.
(Go to Branch 4)
 What you lack is strength!
 What you lack is strength!
(Go to Branch 3)
 Where did you see those monsters?
 You have a point...
 You know... it's okay not to be a knight.
 You know... it's okay not to be a knight.
(Go to Branch 1)
 You seem to be... working hard...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 01.ogg ???: Is that... the Honorary Knight? Hello!
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 02.ogg ???: I finally get to meet you, Honorary Knight.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: I'm Noelle, a maid of the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Ah —  apologies... I've yet to officially join the Knights.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: As a maid, and in order to be worthy of this armor, I'm currently undergoing the Knights of Favonius Chivalric Training.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Yes... I haven't passed the selection trials yet, but I've been asking senior knights for advice on how to become a true Knight of Favonius.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: ...I asked Amber how to make a Baron Bunny, and Kaeya's been keeping me busy with various small tasks...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: I even asked the Spark Knight to pass on her experiences, although... Master Jean grounded us shortly after...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Actually... I have always wanted to receive guidance from the Honorary Knight.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: I—I was worried that it might be too... presumptuous to ask...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: I've seen you on the streets of Mondstadt occasionally, but I've always been too busy to disturb you...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: I just finished today's cleaning for the Knights and was about to start my training when I saw you!
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: I... If it's not too much trouble... could I ask you for some guidance on my Chivalric Training?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: So as a senior knight... this is your suggestion?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: But... as a maid, I'm only authorized to deal with smaller tasks.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: The Knights of Favonius is the strongest shield that Mondstadt has. How can I defend the people if I'm only ever dealing with minor matters!
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: That's why I've always wanted to become a real knight of Favonius, to have the power to help more people!
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: Huh? Y—You're joking hehehe... right?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: Really? Even the Honorary Knight?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 20.ogg Noelle: ...I thought the Honorary Knight would only ever be busy with powerful enemies like Stormterror...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 21.ogg Noelle: Well... that is true...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 22.ogg Noelle: Come to think of it, whenever I see you in Mondstadt, you do always seem to be in a hurry...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 23.ogg Noelle: And the fact is... you're hurrying to help others...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 24.ogg Noelle: Oh... Okay, back to Mondstadt it is! Time for today's training to officially begin!
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 25.ogg Noelle: I—I'd like to get your opinion on something, as a senior knight!
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 26.ogg Noelle: I've been keeping up with my maidly duties and knightly exercises.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 27.ogg Noelle: But training progress has been a little slow...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 28.ogg Noelle: Uh... it's really all just cleaning and tidying...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 29.ogg Noelle: Roughly every other day, I do a major clean-up for the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 30.ogg Noelle: Under the beds, the windowsills... nothing can be left out. The smallest corners are the most likely to gather dust.

Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 35.ogg Noelle: I'm actually incredibly busy every day. It's just that... I always feel like something's missing.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 36.ogg Noelle: S—Strength...?
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 37.ogg Noelle: But, I think I'm pretty strong...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 38.ogg Noelle: After he got drunk, I carried Mr. Bruce back to the Knights of Favonius Headquarters myself...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 39.ogg Noelle: I also carried the library's new bookshelves over from Springvale...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 40.ogg Noelle: Even Mr. Huffman said I'm strong.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 41.ogg Noelle: Ah! Of course!
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 42.ogg Noelle: However, even though it's only training... I can't raise my sword against the Honorary Knight.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 43.ogg Noelle: I've got it! Let's go to the training ground at the Knights of Favonius Headquarters. There should be some training dummies there.
(Proceed to Noelle's Strength)
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 44.ogg Noelle: Rest? But... *sigh* ...I've still got so much work to do.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 45.ogg Noelle: Besides... I'm still not skilled enough. Any free time that I get should be spent training.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 46.ogg Noelle: If I want to become a real knight soon, I have to continue to put in more effort than the others.
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 47.ogg Noelle: But... time is precious... if I rest...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 48.ogg Noelle: I'll feel guilty...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 49.ogg Noelle: Ohh... I really hadn't thought about that...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 50.ogg Noelle: Resting... for the sake of training...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 51.ogg Noelle: Ohhhh... so that's why Ms. Lisa always has afternoon tea in the library... I get it now!
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 52.ogg Noelle: Huh... Now that you... mention it...
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 noelle 53.ogg Noelle: Oh! O—Okay!
(Proceed to Fleeting Leisure)
Media:vo noecop001 1906101 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? Seems like someone's calling out to you, (Traveler)! Let's go check it out!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 01.ogg ???: Someone—! Anyone—!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 02.ogg ???: *catches breath* ...And finally... I was saved...
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 03.ogg ???: Thanks... I... I'm not from Mondstadt.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 04.ogg Alois: My name is Alois. I'm a traveling merchant.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 05.ogg Alois: I was on my way to Mondstadt to acquire some of the reputed local wines... so I could take them back to Liyue... Little did I know...
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 06.ogg Alois: Uh... Little did I know I'd run into savage monsters on the way! I mean... savage! They were twice my height!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 07.ogg Alois: I was so scared I ran all the way here, until I just couldn't run anymore... Thank goodness I found you and this... uh... maid.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 08.ogg Alois: Uh, escort me to Mondstadt? Perfect! Let's go...
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 09.ogg Alois: Luggage? Goods? Uhh...
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 10.ogg Alois: Yes! I remember now. The savage monsters I encountered? That's when I lost them!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 11.ogg Alois: No, no... no need! These monsters are ferocious! Three times my height!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 12.ogg Alois: H—Honorary Knight? Then you're a member of the Knights of Favonius?
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 13.ogg Alois: I, uhh... I—I can't remember exactly. I was too busy running.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 14.ogg Alois: —Probably near that crossing in front of us... b—but I can't be sure... *sigh* Never mind...
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 15.ogg Alois: Wait... w—wait a minute! My chest! Argh! A sudden pain in my chest! It must be all that running. Let's look for those things a little bit later...
(He lowers himself to the ground)
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 alois 16.ogg Alois: Uhh... p—perhaps I... maybe you...
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Your point of view on these matters has truly been eye-opening for me, I have a lot to learn!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Just like you said, from now on, I'm going to treat helping people with smaller tasks as a part of my training!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: ...Just thinking about it makes me feel more motivated than ever!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Who's that? I—I need to help!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: ...There, there, take your time, try and take a deep breath first...
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Well my name's Noelle. Don't worry sir, everything's all right. I'll be protecting you from now on.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: So... where are you from? I don't think we've met in Mondstadt before.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: It's okay, Mr. Alois. We're not far from Mondstadt.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Although I'm just an ordinary maid, the small task of escorting a visitor to the city is certainly within my power.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: But, wait a moment... as a traveling merchant, you must have some luggage and some goods?
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Don't worry. No matter the quantity, I'll carry them for you!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 12a.ogg Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 12b.ogg Noelle: Oh, rest easy — (Traveler) is Mondstadt's Honorary Knight. No monster is too ferocious for (him/her).
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: Oh! Chest pain? ...Here, I've got you. Hold my arms and lie down slowly.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: Now do your best to relax. I will examine you.
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: I'm sorry, I must stay here to watch over our visitor, (Traveler). It looks like you'll need to handle the monsters. Oh — and please be careful!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow... Noelle's motivated alright!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: She's got that "gimme a commission before I take 'em all" vibe!
Media:vo noecop001 1906103 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Noelle! Whoa... she's fast... Let's catch up with her!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 01.ogg Alois: No, no, it's okay... I'll be fine with a bit of rest, don't worry about me...
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 02.ogg Alois: Uh, perhaps the monsters ate it?
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 03.ogg Alois: So there were monsters...
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 04.ogg Alois: Didn't I tell you! It's dangerous!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 05.ogg Alois: Uh... um... w—what I meant was...
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 06.ogg Alois: When they jumped, they were thrice — ahem — twice as tall as me!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 07.ogg Alois: ...W—Why are you looking at me like that? Even if they were just slimes, I couldn't have fought them off!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 08.ogg Alois: Heh... I'm just a traveling merchant, you never know what's gonna happen out here...
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 09.ogg Alois: Oh well, looks like Mondstadt was never meant to be, perhaps next time...
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 10.ogg Alois: Ah!?
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 11.ogg Alois: No, no, no! I—I couldn't possibly trouble the Knights of Favonius. This matter... it really is beneath them.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 12.ogg Alois: Heh... No! Absolutely nothing!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 alois 13.ogg Alois: Hey... what are you discussing? So what's next?
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Sorry! If you really don't want to be examined, I still need to take care of you!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Back so soon... A true senior knight!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Did you see Mr. Alois's luggage on the way?
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Oh, you're not hurt, are you, (Traveler)?
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: *sigh* What can we do? If even the Honorary Knight can't find them...
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: I'm very sorry... In these circumstances, I must ask you to register the quantity and nature of your lost property with the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: I know that the Knights will do their best to help you recover your goods!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: On the contrary, it's the duty of the Knights to look after any visitors traveling to and from Mondstadt.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: As a maid, I must do my best in receiving and escorting such visitors.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: But then... perhaps there's something keeping you from going to the Knights?
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Mm? Everything okay?
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Well... actually, I noticed that too.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: But since we don't have any evidence of wrongdoing, he deserves the benefit of the doubt.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: This gentleman was seeking help at the gates of Mondstadt, which makes him a guest of the city.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: Therefore, I must carry out my maidly duties.
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: Mm-hmm, thank you for understanding!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: Oh... Sorry to keep you waiting!
Media:vo noecop001 1906104 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: We've talked it over, and we've decided to escort you back to Mondstadt!
