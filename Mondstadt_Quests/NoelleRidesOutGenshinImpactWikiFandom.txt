 It looks just like the ones Amber makes! Noelle, you are very handy!
 Jean doesn't always sit in her office.
 Jean often helps out the locals around town.
 Just set a goal first. We can start from the smaller details.
 Kaeya doesn't spend every second of every day on making big plans.
 Or maybe you're just not suited to becoming an Outrider...
 Perhaps Amber controls it using her Pyro abilities...
 Quest DescriptionNoelle reveals to you that she is very anxious about the Knights of Favonius selection exam. At your suggestion, she decides to emulate the knights she knows in an attempt to overcome her sense of unease.
 Then let's start with the Angel's Share.
 You can start with some smaller details.
 You could become a Cavalry Captain, like Kaeya.
 You could become a Cavalry Captain, like Kaeya.

Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Yes, this should be plenty of Valberries...
(Pyro slimes appear)
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Oh? Pyro Slimes? Perfect, they can provide us with another ingredient we need.
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Pyro Slime Condensate... Crushed Valberries...
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Good! Now I can start to make a Baron Bunny!
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Mm-hmm... Through here... Conceal the stitch... Done!
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: ...Far from it... I know it looks the part on the outside, but I still don't know if it will really work...
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: There should be a hilichurl camp nearby. Let's place the Baron Bunny there and try it out.
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Ah! The hilichurls are coming back. Let's see if the Baron Bunny gets their attention.
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: What's going on... They're completely ignoring the Baron Bunny...
Media:vo noecop002 1909001 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: They're coming this way! (Traveler), watch out!
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Ohhhh....
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: ...It neither attracted their attention nor exploded... In the end, all I managed to recreate was the outward appearance...
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: I suppose the conclusion is: I can't become an Outrider like Amber.
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Hmm... Maybe I am not yet ready to carry out the work of a fully qualified knight...
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: But... I just can't think of what else I could do...
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: Every time I've looked forward to passing the exam, I always ended up disappointed in the end...
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: Whenever I remember that feeling of disappointment, I stop being able to think about what kind of knight I could become...
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: C—Captain Kaeya? No, I could never manage that...
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: Captain Kaeya has his own way of thinking and planning... Sometimes, I can barely understand it, and as for imitating it...
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: I simply wouldn't know where to begin.
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: Oh, so you mean I should focus on smaller steps in order to achieve a larger goal?
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: I suppose with smaller goals, I won't be disappointed day-to-day... Since the larger goal is so light, I couldn't hope to achieve it immediately.
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: In which case... Hmmm... Captain Kaeya seems to be in the habit of fishing for information at the Angel's Share.
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: That's pretty small... and yet... I heard that the reason we were able to arrest those Treasure Hoarders last time was thanks to Captain Kaeya's intel.
Media:vo noecop002 1909002 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: Alright... I hope I can find some intel that proves useful to Mondstadt...
(Proceed to Noelle the Intelligence Operative)
Noelle: But the thought of becoming a knight just like her in every way... I could never achieve that.
Noelle: But... where to start? I can't imagine what I would need to do to become more like Master Jean...
Noelle: I still don't think I can do what Master Jean does... But at least I could start by trying to be gentle like her.
Noelle: Master Jean is a pillar of the Knights of Favonius and a great source of inspiration to me... If I could gain even one or two of her qualities, I would be very happy.
Noelle: M—Master Jean!? How could I ever become someone great like her?
Noelle: Oh... That's true, Master Jean is always lending a hand to citizens in need... So strong, but so gentle, too...
Noelle: Okay, then let's head back to Mondstadt and see if anyone needs help.
(Proceed to Substitute Acting Grand Master Noelle)
Noelle: Y—You think so? ...I suppose if the goal is set so high that I couldn't hope to achieve it right away, I won't be too disappointed day to day...
