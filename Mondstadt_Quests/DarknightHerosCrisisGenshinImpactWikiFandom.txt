 Burn him with Searing Hand again!
Media:vo dlclq002 10 abyss 05a 1.ogg Abyss Mage: Ugh...
Media:vo dlclq002 10 diluc 04a 1.ogg Diluc: Playing dead won't help you — that fire was nowhere near strong enough to— Oh... He seems to have passed out...
Media:vo dlclq002 10 diluc 04a 2.ogg Diluc: Hey! You sleep when I say you can sleep!
Media:vo dlclq002 10 abyss 05a 2.ogg Abyss Mage: Aah! It burns!
 Burn him with Searing Hand!
 Bury our heads firmly in the sand?
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 04a.ogg Huffman: Haha... Good one. But no, the Knights cannot afford to simply stand by and watch while there is even the slightest inkling of a threat facing Mondstadt.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 04a 1.ogg Huffman: If that were the case, more and more people would start to rely on the Darknight Hero instead of the Knights of Favonius.
 Could I first ask what's going on?
Media:vo dlclq002 2 huffman 03a.ogg Huffman: Ah yes, of course I should fill you in first... apologies for my appalling lapse of etiquette.
 I will keep it in mind.
 If they knew we can't read it, why did they write it in the first place?
 Interrogate him about their plan of attack.
 Join forces with the Darknight Hero?
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 04b.ogg Huffman: No. That would send a signal that the Knights are in favor of the Darknight Hero's continued presence in our city... which we are not.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 04b 1.ogg Huffman: Encouraging this kind of individual heroism undermines the Knights' authority.
 Quest DescriptionYour inquiries were slowly bringing the Darknight Hero's identity to light, but just then, you met the man himself. His true identity is Diluc, owner of the Dawn Winery — and his actions have long since attracted the attention of the Knights of Favonius...
 Sorry, we've got nothing.
Media:vo dlclq002 2 huffman 03b.ogg Huffman: Is that so... That is a pity indeed.
 Stay at the winery until this blows over.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05b.ogg Diluc: That would be tantamount to handing this over to the Knights.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05b 1.ogg Diluc: Had they been worthy of this task to begin with, things would never have escalated to this point.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: In any case, circumstances are not dire enough to warrant me going into hiding and leaving the Knights to deal with the consequences.
 Thank you for the information.
 What are we to do about the Abyss Order's challenge?
 Why would they send you a written message that only they can read?
 You really should join forces with the Knights...
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05a.ogg Diluc: No. That would be playing right into the hands of the Abyss Order.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05a 1.ogg Diluc: They know full well that we don't exactly see eye to eye. They're using this as a means to force me into making an appearance.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05a 2.ogg Diluc: If my identity were exposed, all my future activities would be subject to some degree of interference from the Knights.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05a 3.ogg Diluc: After all, no powerful organization wishes to be outdone by someone from the outside.
(He gives you a Letter from the Abyss Order which says the following)
To the "Darknight Hero"
??? ????? ????? has endured too long your self-proclaimed ????????????? and hypocrisy. We hereby ????????? you:

??? ????? ????? has endured too long your self-proclaimed ????????????? and hypocrisy. We hereby ????????? you:
Media:vo dlclq002 10 abyss 01.ogg Abyss Mage: How did you find me here!? Favonian scum!
Media:vo dlclq002 10 abyss 02.ogg Abyss Mage: I see you received our letter... But if you think I'm going to let you in on our secrets, I'm afraid you're quite mistaken!
Media:vo dlclq002 10 abyss 03.ogg Abyss Mage: D—Did you just use a Pyro Vision to shoot f—fire from your hands!? ...Ah! It burns!!
Media:vo dlclq002 10 abyss 04.ogg Abyss Mage: Stop! Stop! P—Please, the pain— I beg you... make it stop!
Media:vo dlclq002 10 abyss 05a 1.ogg Abyss Mage: Ugh...
Media:vo dlclq002 10 abyss 05a 2.ogg Abyss Mage: Aah! It burns!
Media:vo dlclq002 10 abyss 05b 1.ogg Abyss Mage: I'll talk, I'll talk! Ow ow ow... P—Please, stop! I'll tell you everything!
Media:vo dlclq002 10 abyss 05b 2.ogg Abyss Mage: Th—The Abyss Order, we've amassed a force bound by a shared hatred for the Darknight Hero...
Media:vo dlclq002 10 abyss 05b 3.ogg Abyss Mage: They... They will march on the Mondstadt city gates at 10 PM tomorrow night.
Media:vo dlclq002 10 abyss 05b 4.ogg Abyss Mage: That's everything I know... Please... Don't make me suffer those flames again...
Media:vo dlclq002 10 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: I am no Knight of Favonius. Now, start talking! Your plan, what is it?
Media:vo dlclq002 10 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: Hmph. You appear to have misunderstood the situation you are in.
Media:vo dlclq002 10 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Let's see how long it takes for you to crack...
Media:vo dlclq002 10 diluc 04a 1.ogg Diluc: Playing dead won't help you — that fire was nowhere near strong enough to— Oh... He seems to have passed out...
Media:vo dlclq002 10 diluc 04a 2.ogg Diluc: Hey! You sleep when I say you can sleep!
Media:vo dlclq002 10 diluc 04b.ogg Diluc: That's it? Well, I doubt you'd be foolish enough to keep anything else hidden.
Media:vo dlclq002 13 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Now that I have the information I need, I must prepare.
Media:vo dlclq002 13 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: I would be grateful if you could keep me updated on how the Knights of Favonius respond to this matter.
Media:vo dlclq002 13 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: ...Why are you acting so strange all of a sudden?
Media:vo dlclq002 13 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: ...
Media:vo dlclq002 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yes, Master Diluc sir! Anything you say, Master Diluc sir!
Media:vo dlclq002 13 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: In... in light of what just went down here a moment ago...
Media:vo dlclq002 13 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Master Diluc has officially reached No. 1 on Paimon's "people not to tick off under any circumstances" list...
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 01.ogg Huffman: If we do not make contact with the Darknight Hero soon...
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 02.ogg Huffman: Ah, it's you two. I must admit, this issue of the Darknight Hero is proving to be something of a headache.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 03.ogg Huffman: We've just held a meeting to decide on an appropriate course of action. Can you guess what it is?
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 04a 1.ogg Huffman: If that were the case, more and more people would start to rely on the Darknight Hero instead of the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 04a.ogg Huffman: Haha... Good one. But no, the Knights cannot afford to simply stand by and watch while there is even the slightest inkling of a threat facing Mondstadt.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 04b 1.ogg Huffman: Encouraging this kind of individual heroism undermines the Knights' authority.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 04b.ogg Huffman: No. That would send a signal that the Knights are in favor of the Darknight Hero's continued presence in our city... which we are not.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 05.ogg Huffman: Find out the Darknight Hero's true identity, and offer him our protection.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 06.ogg Huffman: Pff...
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 07.ogg Huffman: Well, since you've aided the Knights in the past, I might as well just tell you.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 08.ogg Huffman: The offer of protection is just a ruse, in order for the Knights of Favonius to take over full — and exclusive — responsibility for this matter.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 09.ogg Huffman: Firstly, to show the might of the Knights of Favonius — to prove to the people that without the Darknight Hero, they can still rely on the Knights to maintain peace and harmony.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 10.ogg Huffman: Secondly, the Abyss Order have no mercy in their hearts. If anything happened to the Darknight Hero...
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 11.ogg Huffman: It would only serve to further their nefarious ambitions.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 12.ogg Huffman: But none of this will work if we don't establish the Darknight Hero's true identity in time.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 13.ogg Huffman: Ah, Captain Kaeya.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 14.ogg Huffman: Yes, Captain Kaeya! ...But, does that mean that...
Media:vo dlclq002 15 huffman 15.ogg Huffman: Master Diluc is the Darknight Hero?
Media:vo dlclq002 15 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: There's no need to despair, Huffman. Just follow my plan and everything will be fine.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Lately, Master Diluc has been working the bar at the Angel's Share every night.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: All I need you to do is keep him in your sight. Think you can manage that for me?
Media:vo dlclq002 15 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Who knows...? It's just a hunch. I've been known to be wrong on occasion.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh. Well, what's the plan then?
Media:vo dlclq002 15 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: "Protection"? He seems to be doing just fine without your protection so far, y'know...
Media:vo dlclq002 15 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You aren't gonna let the Darknight Hero be all heroic and stuff? Why not?
Media:vo dlclq002 15 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Gosh... Paimon never knew the life of a knight involved so much untold anguish before.
Media:vo dlclq002 15 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Wow, Paimon feels we saw a whole new side of the Knights of Favonius today...
Media:vo dlclq002 15 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: But Paimon doesn't understand, how is Kaeya so sure he knows who the Darknight Hero is?
Media:vo dlclq002 15 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: We need to get to the winery and tell Master Diluc as soon as Paimonly possible!
Media:vo dlclq002 2 huffman 01.ogg Huffman: Oh, it's you two. Thank you for coming.
Media:vo dlclq002 2 huffman 02.ogg Huffman: So — the Darknight Hero. Do you have anything else you're able to share with me?
Media:vo dlclq002 2 huffman 03a.ogg Huffman: Ah yes, of course I should fill you in first... apologies for my appalling lapse of etiquette.
Media:vo dlclq002 2 huffman 03b.ogg Huffman: Is that so... That is a pity indeed.
Media:vo dlclq002 2 huffman 04.ogg Huffman: The situation is... here. Take a look at this.
Media:vo dlclq002 2 huffman 05.ogg Huffman: Indeed. Although this is written in the common tongue, it appears that a cipher has been used in many places.
Media:vo dlclq002 2 huffman 06.ogg Huffman: Nevertheless, one can grasp the general message from the non-ciphered portions alone...
Media:vo dlclq002 2 huffman 07.ogg Huffman: This is a war declaration from the Abyss Order to the Darknight Hero.
Media:vo dlclq002 2 huffman 08.ogg Huffman: Something like that. Thus, we are hoping to contact him as soon as possible so that we can attempt to coordinate a response.
Media:vo dlclq002 2 huffman 09.ogg Huffman: After all, this matter no longer concerns merely the Darknight Hero himself. It impacts the entire city of Mondstadt.
Media:vo dlclq002 2 huffman 10.ogg Huffman: If you find out anything at all, come and find me.
Media:vo dlclq002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huffman!
Media:vo dlclq002 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Geez... what horrible handwriting!
Media:vo dlclq002 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm, let me take a closer look... Huh, some parts of this seem to be complete gibberish.
Media:vo dlclq002 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Does that mean... the bad guys want the Darknight Hero to go away forever and ever?
Media:vo dlclq002 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: A war declaration sent by the Abyss Order...
Media:vo dlclq002 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: This is not good news at all for Master Diluc! Quick, we should go tell him right away!
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: I take it you're about to inform me of the war declaration from the Abyss Order?
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: I am aware of it. Though I appreciate you for taking the trouble to come all this way.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: The Dawn Winery's intelligence network extends beyond commercial matters.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: I'm open to suggestions...
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05a 1.ogg Diluc: They know full well that we don't exactly see eye to eye. They're using this as a means to force me into making an appearance.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05a 2.ogg Diluc: If my identity were exposed, all my future activities would be subject to some degree of interference from the Knights.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05a 3.ogg Diluc: After all, no powerful organization wishes to be outdone by someone from the outside.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05a.ogg Diluc: No. That would be playing right into the hands of the Abyss Order.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05b 1.ogg Diluc: Had they been worthy of this task to begin with, things would never have escalated to this point.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05b.ogg Diluc: That would be tantamount to handing this over to the Knights.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: In any case, circumstances are not dire enough to warrant me going into hiding and leaving the Knights to deal with the consequences.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 07.ogg Diluc: There is a way. But for it to work, I need some more information.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 08.ogg Diluc: Specifically, I need to decipher the obscured portions of the Abyss Order's war declaration.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 09.ogg Diluc: It must be a cipher only understood by members of the Abyss Order, used to spread messages within the organization.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 10.ogg Diluc: It's not simply a war declaration, but also a notification to their own.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 11.ogg Diluc: When you take a stand that makes you a hero to one party, you also become a villain to the other.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 12.ogg Diluc: And since I've been the Abyss Order's enemy for so long...
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 13.ogg Diluc: They've made me the target around which they can rally their troops and unite their strength.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 14.ogg Diluc: I understand my enemy well is all. As the saying goes, heroes and villains are two sides of the same coin.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 15.ogg Diluc: Simple. When you don't understand something, you ask.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 diluc 16.ogg Diluc: I've already tracked down one of their strongholds... If you're interested, feel free to come along.
Media:vo dlclq002 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Master Diluc! Just now we were at the Knights of Favonius and, and—
Media:vo dlclq002 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What?
Media:vo dlclq002 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Great! So, what's the plan, Master Diluc?
Media:vo dlclq002 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Whew... the Abyss Order has really dealt you a tough hand this time. What a sneaky little bunch those guys are!
Media:vo dlclq002 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Obscured portions? You mean the bits Paimon can't read?
Media:vo dlclq002 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Wow... Seems like it takes a lot of brains to be a superhero, huh?
Media:vo dlclq002 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: So what're we gonna do about the intel that's written in gibberish then? How do we... ungibberishify it?
Media:vo dlclq002 6 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: This is the place.
Media:vo dlclq002 6 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: Abandoned ruins like these are precisely the kind of place the Abyss Order likes to camp out.
Media:vo dlclq002 6 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Come on. There's no time to lose.
