Media:vo wdlq001 6 ellin 02.ogg Ellin: Shame, didn't manage to smash them all in time. Well, if at first you don't succeed...
(The dummies respawn)

Media:vo wdlq001 6 ellin 03.ogg Ellin: Huh, so THAT's how you do it. I'm impressed!
 "Imaginary" means "in your imagination."
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 06a.ogg Paimon: Imaginary... imagination...
 "In your imagination" means "imaginary."
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 06b.ogg Paimon: Imagination... imaginary...
 A monocle equipped with some sort of... detector?
Media:vo wdlq001 1 venti 05a.ogg Venti: That's right! Looks like a monocle, but actually it's called a nirnama detector.
 Am I... seeing things...?
 Are you two family, or...?
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 03b 1.ogg Flora: Hehehe, you mean me and Mr. Floatty?
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 03b 2.ogg Flora: Mr. Floatty is my bestest friend. We live together.
 Ellin is a conscientious child.
Media:vo wdlq001 5 paimon 03a.ogg Paimon: So she's so determined to become a knight that she... Okay, that's kinda weird.
 Ellin is really determined to become a knight.
Media:vo wdlq001 5 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: Yeah, she's so conscientious it's... terrifying!
 Exactly, yes.
 Hi Flora. Can I ask a question?
 Hi. Have you got a minute?
 I believe you'll succeed, Ellin.
 I had an imaginary friend too when I was a kid.
 I've heard of "guardian angels," but come on...
 Looks like a regular monocle to me.
Media:vo wdlq001 1 venti 05b.ogg Venti: I know, right? Apparently, though, it's called a nirnama detector.
 Not someone I know.
 Oh, I know Stanley.
 Paimon, it's time to say the line.
 Quest DescriptionAt the feet of the Anemo Archon Statue in the plaza in front of Mondstadt Cathedral, you and Paimon discover a little girl playing with her imaginary friend...
 Seems adults are the same everywhere.
 Sure they do.
 Sure. Where can I find him?
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 06b 1.ogg Ellin: He's gone adventuring at the Temple of the Lion with Stanley today.
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 06b 2.ogg Ellin: Stanley's a truly legendary adventurer, renowned in all of Mondstadt. He once set foot in the Mare Jivari.
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 06b 3.ogg Ellin: We were gonna meet up tonight and discuss adventure plans... Could you let him know it'll have to be another day?
 Temple of the Lion? Sure, I miss that place!
 That line you love to say so much.
 The one about exploring the area ahead of us later.
 There's nothing wrong with that.
 They're... invisible now.
 Tragically, yes.
 We, uh, don't hang out anymore.
 Who's Jack?
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 06a 1.ogg Ellin: He's a friend of mine. Recently started as an adventurer.
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 06a 2.ogg Ellin: We were gonna meet up tonight and discuss adventure plans... Could you let him know it'll have to be another day?
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 06a 3.ogg Ellin: If I'm not mistaken, you should find him at the Temple of the Lion. He's adventuring with Stanley today.
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 06a 4.ogg Ellin: Stanley's a truly legendary adventurer, renowned in all of Mondstadt. He once set foot in the Mare Jivari.
 Who's your... friend?
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 03a 1.ogg Flora: Hmm? Oh, you mean Mr. Floatty? Most people can't see him.
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 03a 2.ogg Flora: Mr. Floatty is my bestest friend. We grew up together!
 Wow, it really works!
 Yeah! Seems like they're best friends.
Media:vo dialog wdlq001 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: So, let me get this straight. You have a device with which you were trying to see if I have an imaginary friend?
Media:vo dialog wdlq001 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: You're wasting your time. And to be clear, fifteen years earlier you still would have been wasting your time.
Media:vo dialog wdlq001 ellin 02.ogg Ellin: Thanks for agreeing to help me out.
Media:vo dialog wdlq001 ellin 03.ogg Ellin: Jack's at the Temple of the Lion. Don't forget...
Media:vo dialog wdlq001 flora 01.ogg Flora: Come on Mr. Floatty, let's water the flowers!
Media:vo dialog wdlq001 hardworkingsilio 01.ogg Hardworking Silio: One more, please. Ah, I'm feeling better already.
Media:vo dialog wdlq001 hardworkingsilio 02.ogg Hardworking Silio: Hmm... If I could have an imaginary friend, it'd probably be a beer mug.
Media:vo dialog wdlq001 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Imaginary friends? Wow. What a fascinating thing to investigate!
Media:vo dialog wdlq001 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: I would love to join you, really... but I'm already several drinks in. Hahaha...
Media:vo dialog wdlq001 nora 01.ogg Nora: It's so big and pretty.
Media:vo dialog wdlq001 nora 02.ogg Nora: I really wanna go up there with my friend...
Media:vo dialog wdlq001 recklesspallad 01.ogg Reckless Pallad: Me? No, I don't imagine any friends. Too busy imagining epic adventures!
Media:vo dialog wdlq001 timmie 01.ogg Timmie: If anyone tries to shoot my pigeons, I'll get my friend on 'em! Piew-piew! Boom-boom! Bang!
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, (Traveler)... look over there!
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: She's... all by herself, right?
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Because she's acting as if she's talking and laughing with somebody else... Uhhh! Paimon's creeped out...
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: What? You mean you used to act like that too, (Traveler)?
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Uh... so is this... an invisible friend who hangs out with you sometimes? Or... do they just exist in your imagination?
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 06a.ogg Paimon: Imaginary... imagination...
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 06b.ogg Paimon: Imagination... imaginary...
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: ...Oh, you must mean "imagined friend," right? Why didn't you just say so!
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: So, this "imaginary friend" of yours... When does Paimon get to meet them?
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Seriously? So imaginary friends just... disappear when you grow up?
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 10a.ogg Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 10b.ogg Paimon: Oh... Paimon was looking forward to meeting yours... Hey, don't suppose your (sister/brother) has an imaginary friend, too?
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: No way! You guys are so lucky...
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Because they have this game in Liyue — have you heard of it? It's a four player game, but it seems you guys could play it with just the two of you!
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Tone-Deaf Bard! What are you doing here!
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Why does the thought of Lisa's contraptions make Paimon so nervous...
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: D—Dangerous!?
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Huh? Why can't Lisa use it?
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: So you can see them? Go on, tell us — what does this imaginary friend look like?
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Do you see 'em? Do you see 'em?
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: Paimon wants to see~! ...Wait, but this gizmo isn't in Paimon's size.
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: Alright then, you'll have to be Paimon's eyes on the ground, Traveler! Let's go see what everyone's imaginary friends look like.
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 21.ogg Paimon: Flora from the flower shop always seems kinda... floaty-headed. You know?
Media:vo wdlq001 1 paimon 22.ogg Paimon: Paimon bets she has an imaginary friend.
Media:vo wdlq001 1 venti 01.ogg Venti: Traveler! Fancy meeting you here.
Media:vo wdlq001 1 venti 02.ogg Venti: Haha, I'm here because Lisa has been making some exciting new contraptions.
Media:vo wdlq001 1 venti 03.ogg Venti: Come now, that's no way to speak about the elegant Miss Lisa!
Media:vo wdlq001 1 venti 04.ogg Venti: For this particular contraption, Lisa had to import some dangerous materials from Sumeru.
Media:vo wdlq001 1 venti 05a.ogg Venti: That's right! Looks like a monocle, but actually it's called a nirnama detector.
Media:vo wdlq001 1 venti 05b.ogg Venti: I know, right? Apparently, though, it's called a nirnama detector.
Media:vo wdlq001 1 venti 06.ogg Venti: Sadly, Lisa isn't able to use it herself, so I'm borrowing it for a while. ...And also, I'm testing it out for her, to see if it actually works.
Media:vo wdlq001 1 venti 07.ogg Venti: Hmm... Perhaps it's because she lacks a certain childlike sense of wonder? Or maybe there's some other reason for it.
Media:vo wdlq001 1 venti 08.ogg Venti: If you want to know for sure, just ask her yourself sometime.
Media:vo wdlq001 1 venti 09.ogg Venti: Haha... That would be telling.
Media:vo wdlq001 1 venti 10.ogg Venti: Anyway, it's all yours now, Traveler. Take a look, see if you can see Nora's imaginary friend.
(While using the monocle you see her imaginary friend)
Media:vo wdlq001 1 venti 11.ogg Venti: So, it does work for you too...
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 01.ogg Flora: Hehehe, hi Traveler, hi Bard.
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 02.ogg Flora: Sure. How can I help?
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 03a 1.ogg Flora: Hmm? Oh, you mean Mr. Floatty? Most people can't see him.
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 03a 2.ogg Flora: Mr. Floatty is my bestest friend. We grew up together!
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 03b 1.ogg Flora: Hehehe, you mean me and Mr. Floatty?
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 03b 2.ogg Flora: Mr. Floatty is my bestest friend. We live together.
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 04.ogg Flora: Say hello, Mr. Floatty! They can see you.
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 05.ogg Flora: What's wrong with it? I always wanted to be friends with a plant who could fly.
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 06.ogg Flora: Hehehe, because then when it's windy you and your friend can fly off into the sky together! You gotta admit that's pretty cool.
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 07.ogg Flora: Hehehe, that's what some people like to call it.
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 08.ogg Flora: I only found out this plant existed from an explorer who told me stories of his adventures.
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 09.ogg Flora: I think his name was... Stanley!
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 10.ogg Flora: Stanley's an adventurer.
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 11.ogg Flora: And you can tell he's an expert at it from the stories he tells! Hehehe.
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 12.ogg Flora: "The amazing adventures of Stanley" are super famous in Mondstadt!
Media:vo wdlq001 2 flora 13.ogg Flora: He's in the city at the moment. You should go ask him to tell you some of his stories.
Media:vo wdlq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wait, imaginary friends can be plants now!?
Media:vo wdlq001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: (*grumble* No fair! Paimon hates feeling left out...)
Media:vo wdlq001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Friends with a flying plant? Why?
Media:vo wdlq001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: ...Isn't that called being blown away?
Media:vo wdlq001 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Flora's a pretty mysterious kid.
Media:vo wdlq001 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Paimon's thinking... Ooh, how about that little guy on the bridge?
Media:vo wdlq001 2 venti 01.ogg Venti: There it is. Behold, a floaty imaginary friend for floaty-headed Flora: A Bloatty Floatty!
Media:vo wdlq001 2 venti 02.ogg Venti: Flora... Why exactly are you friends with a Bloatty Floatty?
Media:vo wdlq001 2 venti 03.ogg Venti: That sounds like a fun idea for next time! But right now we have other things to attend to...
Media:vo wdlq001 2 venti 04.ogg Venti: Which child shall we interrogate next?
Media:vo wdlq001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: N—no way!
Media:vo wdlq001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Timmie's imaginary friend is a R—Ruin Guard!?
Media:vo wdlq001 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Paimon's freaking out right now... That thing is sure to attack us!
Media:vo wdlq001 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? Paimon has a favorite line?
Media:vo wdlq001 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Seriously? Oh, alright then...
Media:vo wdlq001 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: How about we explore the area ahead of us later?
Media:vo wdlq001 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Children are more open-minded... is that why they can think up all kinds of imaginary friends?
Media:vo wdlq001 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: What about adults' imagination? Let's ask some adults at the tavern!
Media:vo wdlq001 3 venti 01.ogg Venti: Well. That... is unexpected.
Media:vo wdlq001 3 venti 02.ogg Venti: Haha... What say you we postpone our conversation with Timmie for the time being?
Media:vo wdlq001 3 venti 03.ogg Venti: Fitting, isn't it? That the City of Freedom should be home to children with such boundless powers of imagination.
Media:vo wdlq001 4 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Seems to me you'd find some way of keeping yourself amused even if you drank alone.
Media:vo wdlq001 4 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: Just... drink responsibly on my premises, okay?
Media:vo wdlq001 4 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: "Throw you out"?
Media:vo wdlq001 4 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: I see no reason to cling to things that have outlived their purpose.
Media:vo wdlq001 4 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: Sorry, I have no recollection.
Media:vo wdlq001 4 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: The thing about wine is, you have to drink it at the tavern or you miss out on half the fun.
Media:vo wdlq001 4 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Haha, if I didn't know any better, I would say you're being deliberately uncivil.
Media:vo wdlq001 4 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Oh? And if I did have one too many, what then? You'd throw me out along with the trash, is that it?
Media:vo wdlq001 4 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: You know... the same way you threw out Father's legacy? You sold off his mansion – or maybe you've forgotten?
Media:vo wdlq001 4 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Is that so? Then I trust you were most swift indeed to part with a certain vase?
Media:vo wdlq001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Seems our suspicions were right... Grown-ups don't appear to have imaginary friends.
Media:vo wdlq001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So people just stop dreaming when they grow up? Okay, well, Paimon for one never wants to grow up!
Media:vo wdlq001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh... Somehow, Paimon finds the idea of not being able to see Ellin's imaginary friend kinda scary...
Media:vo wdlq001 4 recklesspallad 01.ogg Reckless Pallad: That's odd. Master Diluc, I'm sure I saw such a vase in your home — a beautiful one, unmistakable, in fact...
(While using the monocle, you don't see any imaginary friends)
Media:vo wdlq001 4 venti 01.ogg Venti: Like I said — a lack of childlike wonder.
Media:vo wdlq001 4 venti 02.ogg Venti: Hmm... This raises an interesting question: At what age, exactly, do people's imaginary friends disappear?
Media:vo wdlq001 4 venti 03.ogg Venti: Let's... go and check.
Media:vo wdlq001 4 venti 04.ogg Venti: Hmm... How about Ellin? Someone of her age surely must have some imagination left, don't you think?
Media:vo wdlq001 5 ellin 01.ogg Ellin: Hmm? Oh, hello. What are you guys doing?
Media:vo wdlq001 5 ellin 02.ogg Ellin: You bet. Today, I heard Stanley talking about his adventures. It was incredible! It got me really pumped up.
Media:vo wdlq001 5 ellin 03.ogg Ellin: I hope I can be as outstanding as him one day.
Media:vo wdlq001 5 ellin 04.ogg Ellin: I—I mean, obviously I want to become a knight! ...And if I got to go on an adventure with Jean herself... Well, even better!
Media:vo wdlq001 5 ellin 05.ogg Ellin: Thanks!
Media:vo wdlq001 5 ellin 06.ogg Ellin: I was thinking, it's not every day I get to hang out with the Honorary Knight... Would you join me for some sword training?
Media:vo wdlq001 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Jean! What is Jean doing here?
Media:vo wdlq001 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Is Master Jean Ellin's imaginary friend?
Media:vo wdlq001 5 paimon 03a.ogg Paimon: So she's so determined to become a knight that she... Okay, that's kinda weird.
Media:vo wdlq001 5 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: Yeah, she's so conscientious it's... terrifying!
Media:vo wdlq001 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Are you always training here?
Media:vo wdlq001 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Seems Ellin reeeally looks up to Jean.
Media:vo wdlq001 5 venti 01.ogg Venti: So that you can fight shoulder to shoulder with Master Jean?
Media:vo wdlq001 6 ellin 01.ogg Ellin: How can I smash all these training dummies at once?
Media:vo wdlq001 6 ellin 02.ogg Ellin: Shame, didn't manage to smash them all in time. Well, if at first you don't succeed...
Media:vo wdlq001 6 ellin 03.ogg Ellin: Huh, so THAT's how you do it. I'm impressed!
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 01.ogg Ellin: Whew! Thank you. It's clear I still have a long way to go in my training.
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 02.ogg Ellin: Well, I'm exhausted from training, so clearly my fitness needs some work. One day, though... I'll smash all the training dummies in Mondstadt...
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 03.ogg Ellin: Thanks... Shoot, I got so caught up here I forgot there's something I was supposed to do today!
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 04.ogg Ellin: Ugh... But I'm so sore from training, I can hardly move...
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 05.ogg Ellin: Honorary Knight, could you deliver a message to Jack for me?
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 06a 1.ogg Ellin: He's a friend of mine. Recently started as an adventurer.
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 06a 2.ogg Ellin: We were gonna meet up tonight and discuss adventure plans... Could you let him know it'll have to be another day?
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 06a 3.ogg Ellin: If I'm not mistaken, you should find him at the Temple of the Lion. He's adventuring with Stanley today.
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 06a 4.ogg Ellin: Stanley's a truly legendary adventurer, renowned in all of Mondstadt. He once set foot in the Mare Jivari.
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 06b 1.ogg Ellin: He's gone adventuring at the Temple of the Lion with Stanley today.
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 06b 2.ogg Ellin: Stanley's a truly legendary adventurer, renowned in all of Mondstadt. He once set foot in the Mare Jivari.
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 06b 3.ogg Ellin: We were gonna meet up tonight and discuss adventure plans... Could you let him know it'll have to be another day?
Media:vo wdlq001 7 ellin 07.ogg Ellin: Great! Thank you so much.
Media:vo wdlq001 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ellin, Ellin, she's our girl! If she can't do it... um, hilichurl!
Media:vo wdlq001 7 venti 01.ogg Venti: So modest! I for one think you're quite the pro at this already.
