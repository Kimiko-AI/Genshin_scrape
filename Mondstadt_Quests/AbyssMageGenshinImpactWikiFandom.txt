 And yet you sound almost proud...
 Guess that's why you're god to the City of Freedom...
 I think I've heard people talking about it in Mondstadt.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 06b.ogg Venti: Of course. I believe the people of Mondstadt all know of it.
 Is it because I can fight?
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 15b 1.ogg Venti: Well, you could say that... You're definitely a force to be reckoned with.
 Is it because I purified the Teardrop Crystal?
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 15a.ogg Venti: Agreed.
 Let's hunt it down!
 Nope.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 06a.ogg Venti: But Jean and Master Diluc are no doubt aware of it.
 Quest DescriptionYou used the Holy Lyre der Himmel to summon Stormterror, only to be prevented from saving it due to the interference of the Abyss Order. But you haven't given up yet — Diluc has been able to swiftly obtain a new lead...
 This battle... it's going to take everything everyone's got.
 Weren't we just talking about how I can fight?
(Dialogue during CBT1)
Paimon: There it is!
Diluc: An eye for an eye! Punish it with our might!
Diluc: An eye for an eye! Punish it with our might!
Media:vo mdaq064 1 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: The Abyss Order... Enemies of the human race. Even the underground networks rarely come across any information on them.
Media:vo mdaq064 1 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: With that said, it was a bit of a hassle, but I managed to dig up a few clues.
Media:vo mdaq064 1 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Oh, such a humble god... Is it a blessing, or a curse?
Media:vo mdaq064 1 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: But we digress. Let's get back to the topic at hand: the common enemy of all mankind.
Media:vo mdaq064 1 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: We have tracked the Abyss Mage to the vicinity of the winery.
Media:vo mdaq064 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Come to think of it, Mr. Big Anemo God Barbatos — why exactly do you need the help of mere humans...?
Media:vo mdaq064 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Jean... You're such a devotee!
Media:vo mdaq064 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Maybe someone got a little too free and is just too lazy to care...
Media:vo mdaq064 1 qin 01.ogg Jean: "Go forth and establish a city of freedom without rule." We have not forgotten Barbatos' wish for Mondstadt.
Media:vo mdaq064 1 qin 02.ogg Jean: I cannot stress enough how important it is to not let it escape.
Media:vo mdaq064 1 venti 01.ogg Venti: Really? That quickly? You really are well connected, Master Diluc.
Media:vo mdaq064 1 venti 02.ogg Venti: Ahh... How do I put it...
Media:vo mdaq064 1 venti 03.ogg Venti: "The Seven" as people now know them, were once known as "The Seven Archons."
Media:vo mdaq064 1 venti 04.ogg Venti: Each archon presides over their own part of Teyvat. That is the role the archons play.
Media:vo mdaq064 1 venti 05.ogg Venti: Only in performing this duty can we attain power, but I don't like the idea of "ruling" Mondstadt — and I don't feel Mondstadt would really like it either.
Media:vo mdaq064 1 venti 06.ogg Venti: Ahh... However it may have come to be... I haven't been back to Mondstadt for an extended period of time.
Media:vo mdaq064 1 venti 07.ogg Venti: Without a doubt, I am now the weakest archon among The Seven!
Media:vo mdaq064 1 venti 08.ogg Venti: Aww, you flatter me.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Which means we're going to confront Dvalin?
Media:vo mdaq064 3 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: I'm fine with that... Jean is the one who wishes to avoid any direct confrontation.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Hmm?
Media:vo mdaq064 3 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: ...Hey.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: Nice plan. Worth a shot.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: Humans aren't without their strengths. Let's go.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: (Traveler)?
Media:vo mdaq064 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: You Tone-Deaf Bard, don't you see how crazy this is?
Media:vo mdaq064 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You've seen what Dvalin is like when he's ticked off! (Traveler) will be swallowed whole before (he/she) even gets to lift a finger!
Media:vo mdaq064 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Ho~! So we just need to fight monsters from the abyss... and a dragon! No pressure or anything.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 qin 01.ogg Jean: No. When there are no other options left, it is my responsibility to alter our course of action.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 qin 02.ogg Jean: If slaying him is our only choice, I will gladly become the knight that leads the charge.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 qin 03.ogg Jean: By that, you mean...
Media:vo mdaq064 3 qin 04.ogg Jean: I am with you, Honorary Knight!
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 01.ogg Venti: Huh? What's this...
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 02.ogg Venti: After the Abyss Mage was defeated, a certain energy dispersed from its body...
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 03.ogg Venti: It seems that energy was being used to cut off the connection between me and Dvalin.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 04.ogg Venti: ...
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 05.ogg Venti: (Traveler), do you know of Stormterror's Lair?
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 06a.ogg Venti: But Jean and Master Diluc are no doubt aware of it.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 06b.ogg Venti: Of course. I believe the people of Mondstadt all know of it.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 07.ogg Venti: After Dvalin woke up, he took the ancient ruins as his lair.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 08.ogg Venti: As it was with the storms that previously cut Mondstadt off from the outside world, the entrance to the ruins is also sealed by a special barrier.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 09.ogg Venti: But now, as the energy dispersed from the Abyss Mage, I was able to read the rhythmic flow of how the barrier's magic was woven.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 10.ogg Venti: I must admit, it sounds even more horrendous than a chorus of hilichurls, but...
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 11.ogg Venti: ...It should be enough to let us break through the storm barrier and reach Stormterror's Lair.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 12.ogg Venti: Fortunately, we have yet to need to go that far.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 13.ogg Venti: I mean that the Holy Lyre is not our trump card.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 14.ogg Venti: Our real trump card? (Traveler) of course.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 15a.ogg Venti: Agreed.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 15b 1.ogg Venti: Well, you could say that... You're definitely a force to be reckoned with.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 15b 2.ogg Venti: But you have a much more precious forte.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 16.ogg Venti: The impurities in the tears, and the curse that binds Dvalin belong to the same maleficent power.
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 17.ogg Venti: Which means...
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 18.ogg Venti: And so...
Media:vo mdaq064 3 venti 19.ogg Venti: The epic actions of brave heroes finally leads to this eleventh hour.
Paimon: There it is!
