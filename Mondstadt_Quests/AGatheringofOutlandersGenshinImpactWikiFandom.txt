Food and Lodging Arrangements
Accommodations: One of Mr. Goth's other properties (Priority)/The Adventurers' Guild reception area (Backup Plan, to be confirmed).
Food: Group meals on the first day, following which all are free to make their own arrangements amidst the city's various restaurants and taverns. Self-catering facilities will be prepared at lodgings.
Outdoor Activities: Considering our guests' sightseeing interests, Sucrose, Timaeus, myself, and some of the Knights of Favonius can accompany our guests, splitting in groups where necessary.
Obtaining Souvenirs: Multiple collection methods. With Wind Comes Glory, the outdoors themselves, creation through alchemy, and hand-crafting are all possibilities.
Scientific Observations: Emphasis on Botany.
Official Business: No such needs at the moment.
 ...And you find that sort of role-play fun?
 Ah, I'm looking forward to it already.
 Albedo did make something like that once.
 And a blessing or two to boot.
 Didn't expect to see you here at this hour, Dehya.
 Don't let it get you down, Sucrose.
 Don't worry. Leave this to me.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 21a 1.ogg Sucrose: Really? You have a plan?
 Experience is on my side.
 Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
 Experience is on my side.
 Good for you!
 Great.
 I get that feeling as well.
 I have.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 20a 1.ogg Cyno: And that is why I am proud to call you my friend.
 I haven't.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 20b 1.ogg Cyno: Well, you should. For the sake of our continued friendship.
 I know how I can find out.
 I say we put these theories to the test!
 I'll be back shortly.
 If by that, you mean a flower from beyond this world...
 Impressive multi-tasking.
 Is no one gonna interject?
 Is no one gonna stop him from explaining?
 Is she?
 Just don't ruin your appetite for later.
 Just get to the point, Paimon.
 Like an Extra-Sweet Sunsettia?
 Like an Extra-Sweet Sweet Flower?
 More like Sweet Madame Breath.
 Nice idea.
 Or that eating enough Lavender Melons would... uh... have no effect.
 Paimon, be serious.
 Quest DescriptionAs the Windblume Festival approaches, you and Paimon return to Mondstadt, grasped in the throes of festivity, and take on a rather different commission than you are used to...
 That'll be all.
Media:vo eqfh101 4 paimon 03a 1.ogg Paimon: Um... Okay, uh... yeah, that'll be all.
 You know what? Let's have a Sweet Madame as well.
Media:vo eqfh101 4 paimon 03a 2.ogg Paimon: Yay! You're the best person in the whole wide world!
 That's not funny.
 That's right.
 That's... very specific of you, Paimon.
 This method seems a bit arbitrary.
 Ugh... if we must — one Sweet Madame, I guess.
Media:vo eqfh101 4 paimon 03b 1.ogg Paimon: Yay, so you do remember after all! You're just the best!
 Understood.
 We can't give up yet.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 21b 1.ogg Sucrose: ...Yes, you're right.
 We're counting on you for the rest, Paimon.
 We're not late, are we?
 What do you three think?
Media:vo eqfh101 3 paimon 10b 1.ogg Paimon: Wait, doesn't Paimon's opinion matter anymore? Paimon's technically a guest in Mondstadt too, y'know!
 Whoa, Sucrose?
 Whoa, someone needs help after all?
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 09b 1.ogg Paimon: What is wrong with you? That's no way to greet a friend we haven't seen in so long!
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 02b 1.ogg Sucrose: Uh — no, not help like in the Windblume sense... It's just... Ugh, how do I explain...
 Why not?
 Would you like to get the "lantern of utmost joy"?
 Yeah, any thoughts?
 Yes. We should preserve our energy.
 You can count on us.
 You know what? Let's have a Sweet Madame as well.
 You're not included in this itinerary...
Media:vo eqfh101 3 paimon 10a 1.ogg Paimon: That's why it's called "tagging along"!
(Traveler): (Perhaps we can ask a friend about this later...)
Accommodations: One of Mr. Goth's other properties (Priority)/The Adventurers' Guild reception area (Backup Plan, to be confirmed).
After a delicious feast, everyone sits around the campfire...
Everyone brings out their food and starts cooking...
Everyone introduces themselves, and exchanges pleasantries.
Everyone packs up and says their goodbyes in the dark of night...
Food and Lodging Arrangements
Food: Group meals on the first day, following which all are free to make their own arrangements amidst the city's various restaurants and taverns. Self-catering facilities will be prepared at lodgings.
In the time it takes Sara to pack up the Cold Cut Platter, Paimon polishes off the entire Sweet Madame...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: I'd be grateful if you could check on Sucrose. As for our new friends here... leave them to me.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Shall I ask Sucrose to develop a Cecilia variant with improved soil adaptability for you?
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: I should warn you, though, it may very well end up with a name like "Tetratanic Ananemo Cecilia," or perhaps "Epsilon-Series Cecilia, Variation 601, Sumeru Growth-Type."
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: Unfortunately not. I'm being completely serious.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: Back to our previous topic — if you wish to use antitoxic compounds from Calla Lilies in an antidote, then I have a few suggestions...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Ugh, Eula says things in the most awkward way possible sometimes... Just ignore the second half, Collei!
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 ambor 02.ogg Amber: Sounds like someone's up for a fishing contest, huh? Fair warning, though, I won't lose!
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 candace 01.ogg Candace: Setaria, you should take a break and have a bite to eat.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 candace 02.ogg Candace: Setaria?
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 candace 03.ogg Candace: It's alright. I'm glad that you enjoy the work you're doing.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 candace 04.ogg Candace: Well, Rahman's busy with the Eremites these days. But having me stand in as your bodyguard must be a welcome breath of fresh air for you?
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 candace 05.ogg Candace: It's a change for me, too — my first time working as a bodyguard. I'm just treating it as a chance to get a taste of Dehya's line of work.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 candace 06.ogg Candace: But at the end of the day, that's why we know we can count on the General Mahamatra. He and I are of the same mind in this case, so I am very happy to protect you.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 candace 07.ogg Candace: While you're in Aaru Village, we're partners. We don't want to cause you any unnecessary pressure. So please, try to enjoy your time here.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 collei 01.ogg Collei: The cooking pot... Is everything okay?
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 collei 02.ogg Collei: Whoa, did you two see that? A bird with huuuge wings just flew by!
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 collei 03.ogg Collei: If Master Tighnari was here, he'd be able to tell you its scientific name, species, and behaviors...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 collei 04.ogg Collei: But as for me... all I can tell you is, it isn't a species we have in Sumeru...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 collei 05.ogg Collei: Dusk Birds! They have the most beautiful, vibrant colors. The feathers on their chest are the color of ripe Sunsettias, and their wing-tips are the color of tender Mint leaves.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 collei 06.ogg Collei: They're not too skittish around people, and at my tree holl— I mean, this tree that I often go past, there's a Dusk Bird there that always looks at me like it understands what I'm saying.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 collei 07.ogg Collei: I once picked up one of its feathers from the ground, and it felt really nice...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 collei 08.ogg Collei: No, it's fine, I know what she means. She does have a point...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 collei 09.ogg Collei: Are you hungry for fish? I see quite a few over there.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Hmm. So, a good joke is not necessarily required to make people laugh at them...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: So this is Stormterror's Lair...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: ...From which direction will Stormterror appear, I wonder?
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: Who's there?
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: I apologize as well. I acted on force of habit. You must be a local, yes? My name is Cyno, and I'm here sightseeing in Mondstadt. In truth, it is I who am disturbing you.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: I'm waiting for Stormterror to arrive.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: Yes. I hope to capture a good picture as reference material for an artist I know.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: Roughly how often does it appear?
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: Don't worry, I'm quite strong. My neck can take it.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: I'll be alright.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: Oh, hey there, (Traveler). Nice to see ya!
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: Hahaha, well, Cyno's out of the country on a trip, so he got me to come and help his subordinates take care of a few things. I guess you could say I'm his temporary substitute.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: The atmosphere around here's not too bad nowadays, so I don't mind sticking around once in a while.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: You've probably got a lot going on yourself, I'll bet? Good luck with everything!
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 eula 01.ogg Eula: Oh? Then what kinds of birds do you have in Sumeru?
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 eula 02.ogg Eula: You have keen observation skills, and a love for living things. You'd be better served directing your energies there rather than sighing and whining all the time.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 eula 03.ogg Eula: Seriously...? Another competition? I thought we were supposed to be sightseeing. ...Uh, but still — wait for me!
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 marjorie 01.ogg Marjorie: ...And that's everything. Are they all in satisfactory condition?
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 mika 01.ogg Mika: Um, excuse me...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 mika 02.ogg Mika: Ah, sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 mika 03.ogg Mika: Um, might I ask if you're looking for something here?
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 mika 04.ogg Mika: You even set up a Kamera...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 mika 05.ogg Mika: Ah... In that case, let me help keep watch too. From what I've heard, Stormterror's movements have some... regular schedule.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 mika 06.ogg Mika: Uh, hold on. I'll have to check against our data first. Let me consult my notes...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 mika 07.ogg Mika: ...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 mika 08.ogg Mika: Um... Mr. Cyno, Sir, are you going to stand there staring into the sky the entire time?
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 mika 09.ogg Mika: No, no, I mean... You should sit down. I—I brought a blanket — here, you can borrow it!
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 mika 10.ogg Mika: Oh, um... okay, well...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 mika 11.ogg Mika: ...Weird. Now I'm staring up into the sky, too...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 setare 01.ogg Setaria: Ah, thank you! Sorry, I was completely absorbed in what I was doing, I didn't even hear your voice...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 setare 02.ogg Setaria: Sorry you've ended up having to babysit me... I'm sure you have far more important things to do.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 setare 03.ogg Setaria: I tried telling Mahamatra Cyno that I can work unsupervised. Really, this ought to be the last of his worries...
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 setare 04.ogg Setaria: He said that educators willing to work in the desert are an extremely rare breed, so I need a bodyguard for protection at all times... I think he's being a little overprotective.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: ...Yep. Thank you, Marjorie.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Well, Albedo and Sucrose were delightful... but this was still an exhausting meal.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: I've heard that Cecilias only grow in remote spots at high-altitude, and that you're unlikely to ever see one unless you go looking for it.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Though they can be preserved for a long time as specimens, I can't take back the beauty they possess in the wild. It's a shame.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: ...Is this you attempting to tell a joke?
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: In that case, I look forward to... well, whichever of those two it ends up being.
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 venti 01.ogg Venti: Or given the way that you're staring at me, perhaps... you'd like to get me that drink now?
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 venti 02.ogg Venti: I, of course, would be most amenable to that... but I believe you have friends waiting for you?
Media:vo dialog eqfh101 venti 03.ogg Venti: Don't worry! There'll be plenty of time during the festival.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 katheryne 01.ogg Katheryne: Good day, you two. It's nice to see you here at this festive time.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 katheryne 02.ogg Katheryne: Hmm, I'm afraid I'd struggle to find you any commissions in the near future.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 katheryne 03.ogg Katheryne: With the arrival of the Windblume Festival, the only task most Mondstadters are busy with is preparing gifts for their loved ones — but it's customary to do this oneself, without assistance.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 katheryne 04.ogg Katheryne: Think of this period as the off-season for the Mondstadt branch of the Adventurers' Guild.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 katheryne 05.ogg Katheryne: Spring is here, love is in the air, and everyone wants to relax and enjoy themselves. Even the cats at the tavern next door have been getting lovey-dovey with one other recently.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 katheryne 06.ogg Katheryne: Hehe. Perhaps you two could simply take this chance to—
Media:vo eqfh101 1 marjorie 01.ogg Marjorie: 'Scuse me, Sucrose, could I borrow you for a second? Package for you...
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, doesn't Mondstadt celebrate the Windblume Festival around this time of year?
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon has lots of good memories from the last one... the sweet scent of flowers on the breeze, the sweet smell of tasty snacks on the breeze, the feeling of the breeze on... your face? The only downside was the lack of commissions.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: But Paimon's sure that was just a one-time thing. There's gotta be someone who needs our help, right? Let's go see how things are this year!
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hey there, Katheryne!
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Sooo... Got any jobs for us?
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Ew... gross.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: You know that feeling you get when you burst out the doors after a nice nap, hoping to make it to the store before the limited-edition drinks sell out, only to get there just in time to see the last two glasses snatched away right from under your nose by a couple of pesky lovebirds? That's what this feels like.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Whoa, Sucrose?
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 09b 1.ogg Paimon: What is wrong with you? That's no way to greet a friend we haven't seen in so long!
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Go ahead, Sucrose! We don't have anything else to do right now, anyway.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Nice one! So how did they decide who to appoint, anyway?
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Is that a test tube?
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Sounds... fascinating! Are you gonna use them in your research?
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Mmm... Darn, now Paimon's hungry. ...Wait, you're doing this on purpose, aren't you?
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Oh, is that all you need help with? That's easy!
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Just treat Paimon to a Sweet Madame, then you'll get your last Breath of Joy.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Hey, come on! Paimon's doing her best to help, okay!
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Hmm... So does it need to be more, like, official or ceremonious or something?
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: Ohh, Paimon gets it now.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: Long story short, you want us to help you find people for you to help...
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 21.ogg Paimon: ...That's pretty tough, given that it's the Windblume Festival and all!
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 22a.ogg Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 22b.ogg Paimon: Well, if (he/she)'s in, then Paimon'll help too... with the talking, anyway.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 23.ogg Paimon: But um, if things don't work out, can Paimon still get that Sweet Madame?
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 24.ogg Paimon: C'mon, (Traveler), this is a festival of gratitude and love after all. How could you refuse?
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 25.ogg Paimon: Wait, is that who Paimon thinks it is? That's Collei, right? When did she arrive in Mondstadt?
Media:vo eqfh101 1 paimon 26.ogg Paimon: Let's go say hi!
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: (Traveler)! Paimon! Thank goodness I found you. Um, there's something I need your help with.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 02b 1.ogg Sucrose: Uh — no, not help like in the Windblume sense... It's just... Ugh, how do I explain...
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Phew... Okay.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: Here's the situation. I've been appointed as the Windblume Festival Special Ambassador by the Knights of Favonius this year.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: My task is to do good deeds for people during this festival of gratitude and love.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: They spun an empty bottle donated by Angel's Share inside a circle with all our names on it. Whoever's name the bottle stopped at got chosen.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: I think so too. But everyone said that it was to make it fair, so everyone had an equal chance to become the special ambassador.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: The thing is... I'm not great at dealing with people, so I was really daunted by it at first. But I'm still glad that I got this role!
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: Luckily, I came up with a way to spur myself on, which has helped. Have a look.

Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 10.ogg Sucrose: Yep. Every time I do a good deed for someone, I get them to breathe into a test tube. That way, I can collect everyone's "Breaths of Joy."
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 11.ogg Sucrose: Yes. I believe these Breaths of Joy will serve as valuable raw materials for alchemical transmutation. With any luck, I'll be able to produce something truly miraculous.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 12.ogg Sucrose: Haha. Actually, I meant something even more exciting than that.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 13.ogg Sucrose: I can't say for sure until I have more test results to confirm my hypothesis, though. Alchemists mustn't make claims they can't live up to.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 14.ogg Sucrose: Anyway... I'm still missing one final Breath of Joy.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 15.ogg Sucrose: No, joy isn't measured in those terms at all.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 16.ogg Sucrose: Let me put it this way: Have you ever planted a fruit seed and cared for it while it grows?
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 17.ogg Sucrose: In the same way that those tender, sweet fruits are the product of your time and effort, the amount of joy derived from an experience is positively correlated to the degree of hardship overcome during it.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 18.ogg Sucrose: For example, in my case, I would say that to experience a statistically significant amount of joy, I'd have to do something like spend six months developing a medicine formula to a point where it was finally consistently effective.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 19.ogg Sucrose: Similarly, in order to collect a significant amount of joy from other people, I have to find ways to do something sufficiently challenging on their behalf.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 20.ogg Sucrose: Oh... I figured since you're such experienced travelers, you might have some ideas, but if even you don't know how to approach this...
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 21a 1.ogg Sucrose: Really? You have a plan?
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 21b 1.ogg Sucrose: ...Yes, you're right.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 22.ogg Sucrose: Oh, sure.
Media:vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 23.ogg Sucrose: Be right back.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Collei!
Media:vo eqfh101 2 ambor 02.ogg Amber: Collei! Whew...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 ambor 03.ogg Amber: You made good time, huh? You're way earlier than I expected!
Media:vo eqfh101 2 ambor 04.ogg Amber: I spotted your green hair way off in the distance — good thing my eyes are sharp, or I'd have missed you!
Media:vo eqfh101 2 ambor 05.ogg Amber: You bet! They're getting yummier each time you make them.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 ambor 06.ogg Amber: If it's okay with everyone, why don't I take Collei for a walk around town? I'd like to show her some of the places she didn't get to see last time.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 ambor 07.ogg Amber: Oh, that's alright!
Media:vo eqfh101 2 ambor 08.ogg Amber: In that case, you guys go rest up, and I'll go see Master Jean to ask for some time off.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 ambor 09.ogg Amber: (Traveler), Sucrose, could you look after Collei for now?
Media:vo eqfh101 2 ambor 10.ogg Amber: I'll come get her later and take her out. There's still a whole bunch of people I need to introduce her to!
Media:vo eqfh101 2 ambor 11.ogg Amber: Awesome. See ya later, then!
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 01.ogg Collei: ...Oh, hey you guys. What are the chances...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 02.ogg Collei: Um... No, don't worry. I'm fine.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 03.ogg Collei: I was just looking at a Mondstadt children's book in the souvenir shop over there.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 04.ogg Collei: While I was flipping through it, a piece of paper fell out. The writing on it was really mysterious... almost like a prophecy.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 05.ogg Collei: "If you can do these things, you may light the lantern of utmost joy and receive a supreme blessing."
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 06.ogg Collei: "Find a flower that is not of this world. Find a guide who will never get lost. Find one who would never lie. Find a legend that never ends."
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 07.ogg Collei: So four things in total. Here, have a look.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 08.ogg Collei: I asked the lady who owns the store about it, but she said that she didn't know anything about any paper slips.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 09.ogg Collei: Oh, it was called "The Boar Princess."
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 10.ogg Collei: Umm...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 11.ogg Collei: Do you know her?
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 12.ogg Collei: Hello...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 13.ogg Collei: ...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 14.ogg Collei: So, Sucrose, what are your thoughts on this prophecy? Could it be real?
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 15.ogg Collei: ...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 16.ogg Collei: That's a great take. I love it!
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 17.ogg Collei: Okay, so... What do you think the "blessing" is, Sucrose?
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 18.ogg Collei: Wow...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 19.ogg Collei: (Her guesswork is really good, though! I wanna pick her brains some more...)
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 20.ogg Collei: (But will she find it annoying if I keep asking her questions...?)
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 21.ogg Collei: (We've only just met, after all... Aah, what's the best thing to say to someone you're meeting for the first time?)
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 22.ogg Collei: ...!
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 23.ogg Collei: Well... Yes, I mean... if possible...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 24.ogg Collei: Um. I'd wish for a... a better personality.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 25.ogg Collei: That's very kind of you, but if you know me like I do...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 26.ogg Collei: I know that voice! It's...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 27.ogg Collei: Amber! Have you been doing well? Did you... finish all the Pita Pockets I brought you last time?
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 28.ogg Collei: Mm-hmm.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 29.ogg Collei: A long time ago, I had a lot of help from a lot of people here in Mondstadt.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 30.ogg Collei: So ever since my Eleazar got better, I've been looking out for an opportunity to come back to Mondstadt and tell them all the news that I've been cured...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 31.ogg Collei: Thanks...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 32.ogg Collei: I, uh...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 33.ogg Collei: Umm... sorry Amber...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 34.ogg Collei: I agreed to meet my traveling companions by the city gate in a few minutes, so I can't go with you just yet...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 35.ogg Collei: Oh, okay...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 36.ogg Collei: Umm...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 37.ogg Collei: I'm sorry...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 38.ogg Collei: I'm just feeling a little shy today... Don't worry about me.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 39.ogg Collei: (Amber wants to introduce me to more of her friends... Am I gonna be able to cope?)
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 40.ogg Collei: (I've only met Sucrose so far, and I'm already struggling to make conversation...)
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 41.ogg Collei: (I wish I had a little more self-confidence. Then I'd find it much easier to make friends with people...)
Media:vo eqfh101 2 collei 42.ogg Collei: Ah! It's nearly time. Let's go to the gate and see if they've arrived.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Collei! Hey!
Media:vo eqfh101 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: You were staring into space just now. Something the matter?
Media:vo eqfh101 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: And what does "these things" refer to?
Media:vo eqfh101 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Let Paimon do the honors! Collei, this is Sucrose, an alchemist with the Knights of Favonius. And Sucrose, meet Collei. She's a Trainee Forest Ranger from Sumeru's Avidya Forest.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Uh, this is getting awkward fast... They're both so shy!
Media:vo eqfh101 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Exactly! Who would wanna hurt a child's feelings?
Media:vo eqfh101 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Huh?
Media:vo eqfh101 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: You can't waste it on that! You've got a great personality already!
Media:vo eqfh101 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Huh? Wait, remind Paimon... have you been to Mondstadt before?
Media:vo eqfh101 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Sure! Go right ahead!
Media:vo eqfh101 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: You alright there, Collei? You look kinda disappointed...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Hi there. Sorry to butt in, but... what's the name of that storybook you just mentioned?
Media:vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Hmm, that is strange... I've read that book, and it sounds like that note you found has no relation to the story at all.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: H—Hi...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: I, um... W—Without having done any research, I couldn't comment definitively...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: Um, but if you want my subjective opinion, I don't think that it's a nasty prank or anything.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: The only people who read children's books are those with a childlike wonder and imagination... or children, of course. I'm sure that whoever put this prophecy there would understand that...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: Would they really do this just to spread lies and ruin someone's innocence? I can't imagine anyone being so cruel.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: Hmm... Umm...
Media:vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: If I had to guess... Maybe a fairy that can make people's wishes come true, or something?
Media:vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 10.ogg Sucrose: I haven't read many fairy tales, so this is pure speculation... With no other information on hand or prior research to compare against, I'm afraid it might not even be worth considering.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 11.ogg Sucrose: Then, what would you wish for, Collei?
Media:vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 12.ogg Sucrose: Huh?
Media:vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 13.ogg Sucrose: Of course, fine by me.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 14.ogg Sucrose: Sure, no problem.
Media:vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 15.ogg Sucrose: ...
Media:vo eqfh101 3 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Oh, please, Sucrose, "genius" is an unnecessary epithet. It will serve only to leave an exaggerated impression of me in the minds of our guests.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Then please, allow me to help.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Apologies for my tardy entrance in the present discussion.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: I understand you're looking to make an antidote for poisonous fungi, correct?
Media:vo eqfh101 3 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: If you happen to have some samples with you, or relevant documentation on hand, perhaps you might give me the chance to review them later?
Media:vo eqfh101 3 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: But before that, I invite the three of you to look at this.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: Hardly.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: Rather, I should apologize for interrupting a serious discussion between trained professionals, especially after they have traveled so far to be here, when I myself am neither an adventurer, nor a technological consultant, nor a musician.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: Nevertheless, I would encourage you to have a knowledgeable local arrange your detailed itinerary while you're in Mondstadt.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: Take a look, and should you find anything here to be objectionable, it can easily be adjusted.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: Great. Then it's decided.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: Sucrose and I will bring the three of you to your inn for a quick rest. You two, let's meet by the lake this evening.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 collei 01.ogg Collei: Master, this is Sucrose, an alchemist with the Knights of Favonius. We just met.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 collei 02.ogg Collei: Sucrose, this is my teacher, Tighnari. He's a highly respected Forest Watcher in Sumeru, and he's also a very famous botanist.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 collei 03.ogg Collei: Yup! He's extremely knowledgeable, too!
Media:vo eqfh101 3 collei 04.ogg Collei: And this is General Mahamatra Cyno of the Sumeru Akademiya. He's really famous in Sumeru as well!
Media:vo eqfh101 3 collei 05.ogg Collei: Keep me company? But it was you two that insisted on coming...
Media:vo eqfh101 3 collei 06.ogg Collei: But I've been here on my own loads of times before...
Media:vo eqfh101 3 collei 07.ogg Collei: Oh! Sucrose, what were you saying about you having a teacher as well...?
Media:vo eqfh101 3 collei 08.ogg Collei: Pfff...
Media:vo eqfh101 3 collei 09.ogg Collei: I'll help pitch the tents!
Media:vo eqfh101 3 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: ...Why is this humble windmill such a great view?
Media:vo eqfh101 3 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: Because it is the true "Great Vay-iew-vyastra."
Media:vo eqfh101 3 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: Oh, come on. Don't tell me you don't get it?
Media:vo eqfh101 3 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: View, vayu... and also mahamatra, vayuvyastra... no?
Media:vo eqfh101 3 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Greetings. Though if I might say so, we're purely here for personal reasons. You needn't be unduly concerned with our official positions.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: And Collei, there's no need to use my full title. "Cyno" is fine, or "Sir" if you absolutely must.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: Collei is very important to us. We felt obliged to ensure her safety on the long treacherous journey to Mondstadt.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: There should be no issues. I have left my duties in the hands of my subordinates and two especially reliable helpers.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo eqfh101 3 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: We're supposed to be here on vacation, and you're already thinking about how to improve your herbal medicines? Also, I thought we'd agreed to take on new identities for this trip?
Media:vo eqfh101 3 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: Mine was "Adventurer Cyno, skilled desert explorer," Tighnari's was "technological consultant to the Treasure Hoarders," and Collei's was "traveling musician."
Media:vo eqfh101 3 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: Very much so.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 cyno 13.ogg Cyno: Very comprehensive. The adventurer, technological consultant, and musician all approve. Thank you.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Tighnari, Cyno, over here!
Media:vo eqfh101 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What about your work though? What if something bad happens while the General Mahamatra's away?
Media:vo eqfh101 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hey, Albedo's here too! Great, the more, the merrier!
Media:vo eqfh101 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wait, wait!
Media:vo eqfh101 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Can we hold off on the nerdy topic for now? Paimon doesn't wanna be left out...
Media:vo eqfh101 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: What new identities?
Media:vo eqfh101 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Food and lodging arrangements!?
Media:vo eqfh101 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Were you quietly writing this up the whole time? Paimon didn't even notice!
Media:vo eqfh101 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: It looks great! Even Paimon feels like tagging along for the food and board...
Media:vo eqfh101 3 paimon 10a 1.ogg Paimon: That's why it's called "tagging along"!
Media:vo eqfh101 3 paimon 10b 1.ogg Paimon: Wait, doesn't Paimon's opinion matter anymore? Paimon's technically a guest in Mondstadt too, y'know!
Media:vo eqfh101 3 paimon 11a.ogg Media:vo eqfh101 3 paimon 11b.ogg Paimon: Um... and Paimon will take (him/her) to Good Hunter to order some starters. Mondstadt's Cold Cut Platter is not to be missed!
Media:vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Ah, so you have a teacher as well! The pleasure is all mine, Tighnari, Sir.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: I was just going to mention that — I think we're in a somewhat similar situation. I'm an assistant to Mr. Albedo, Mondstadt's genius alchemist.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: M—Mr. Albedo... but it is an objective truth...
Media:vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: Oh... As it happens, I've studied the Calla Lily in quite some detail before, with it being a species native to Mondstadt.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: I wrote a whole report on my findings... If you're interested, Mr. Tighnari Sir, I can go get it for you!
Media:vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: Are you contemplating using some compounds from the Calla Lily as active ingredients in a targeted antidote?
Media:vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: Okay... I got it.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: But... as much as I don't wish to be a wet blanket...
Media:vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: It takes a huge amount of experimental data to conclusively prove how different drugs interact. Estimating the total development time would be very difficult...
Media:vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 10.ogg Sucrose: Add in the time for procurement and delivery of essential materials and I'm not sure if we could complete development before you need to return.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 11.ogg Sucrose: Mr. Albedo!
Media:vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 12.ogg Sucrose: I can help too.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: I mean, it's understandable. It must have been a long time since you last came to Mondstadt.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: ...
Media:vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Phew... Am I glad to see you.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: And who's this young lady?
Media:vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: Collei's exaggerating... I'm Tighnari. Pleased to meet you.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: Indeed. We're not here in an official capacity — just to keep Collei company on her vacation.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: Hmm. So tell me Sucrose — since your specialty is Bio-Alchemy, what do you know about the antitoxic properties of the Calla Lily?
Media:vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: I do wish some of the less cautious adventurers in the Avidya Forest would consider coming to Mondstadt instead.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: What Philanemo Mushrooms lack in texture, they make up for in not causing vomiting or diarrhea.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: Yes. I gathered a few on the way here, and my initial research suggests to me that it could be worth a try.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: This is too kind of you. These arrangements are quite excellent.
Media:vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 12.ogg Tighnari: Just one thing... We'd like the chance to cook as well. Why don't we change the group dinner to a camping and cooking trip?
Media:vo eqfh101 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey Sara, can we have a Cold Cut Platter to go?
Media:vo eqfh101 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Um, do we, uh, want anything else...?
Media:vo eqfh101 4 paimon 03a 1.ogg Paimon: Um... Okay, uh... yeah, that'll be all.
Media:vo eqfh101 4 paimon 03a 2.ogg Paimon: Yay! You're the best person in the whole wide world!
Media:vo eqfh101 4 paimon 03b 1.ogg Paimon: Yay, so you do remember after all! You're just the best!
Media:vo eqfh101 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Paimon'll give you the Sweet Flower from that Sweet Madame as a Windblume!
Media:vo eqfh101 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hehehe! No need to worry about that! Paimon can make room for good food!
Media:vo eqfh101 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: ...Mmm... That was great.
Media:vo eqfh101 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: If that was a Windblume treat, then Paimon wishes it could be the Windblume Festival every day!
Media:vo eqfh101 4 sara 01.ogg Sara: Sure, coming right up!
Media:vo eqfh101 4 sara 02.ogg Sara: Would you like anything else?
Media:vo eqfh101 4 sara 03.ogg Sara: Haha, alright, just a moment...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Alright, looks like we're all here.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: That's correct. Any further deductions?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: That's right.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: I've long heard that Sumeru's Fish with Cream Sauce is noted for its gentle texture, which brings out the tenderness of the fish.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: Here in Mondstadt, we're not quite as varied in the use of spices as in Sumeru, but the principle of bringing certain distinct flavors to the forefront through combinations of natural ingredients is very much the same.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: I'll write a copy of the recipe for you.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: Still, we could test the hypothesis?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: That plant species indigenous to Mondstadt may have an effect on the motor functions of flying lifeforms.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: I think in your case, the two states we would end up with would be highly conscientious Sucrose and stupefied Sucrose.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: Oh, by the way — was there any reason in particular that you chose Mondstadt as your destination on this occasion?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: I see, so you came to Mondstadt in search of Calx.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: If my writer friend were here now, I'm sure he would describe this curious coincidence as having the makings of a good story. It's always a pleasure to meet a fan.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 13.ogg Albedo: Having my new friends address me by my pen name feels somewhat unusual. Please, just call me Albedo.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 14.ogg Albedo: I don't usually take private commissions, but I believe that we are friends now. All of us.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 15.ogg Albedo: Our conversations have been deep and interesting. And Cyno, your passion for this game is indeed one of a kind. I can see it in your eyes.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 16.ogg Albedo: And given that you've come all this way from Sumeru to see me, I'd be quite honored to take this commission.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 17.ogg Albedo: Surely "timeless masterpiece" is something of an overstatement.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 18.ogg Albedo: I see. So this has an almost religious significance... Well, for starters, I'd like to hear a few more of your jokes.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 19.ogg Albedo: I do.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 albedo 20.ogg Albedo: Well, a joke's ability to induce laughter is a separate matter. But I certainly find them fun.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 collei 01.ogg Collei: Heh, thanks...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 collei 02.ogg Collei: It's all thanks to Master and Cyno. They taught me everything I know...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 collei 03.ogg Collei: Uh, no... I just don't eat a lot normally.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 collei 04.ogg Collei: ...
(Sucrose stands up and walks over to the cooking pot nearby)
Media:vo eqfh101 5 collei 05.ogg Collei: Um, sorry, I didn't mean to make things awkward...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 collei 06.ogg Collei: ...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 collei 07.ogg Collei: Hahaha...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 collei 08.ogg Collei: I think (Traveler) and Paimon's conversations are more entertaining than Cyno's jokes.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 collei 09.ogg Collei: Yep, it's true. Sometimes when he's eating, he'll grumble about how the bowl is too shallow for the amount of food it contains, and other random stuff like that.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 collei 10.ogg Collei: Oh, well, Lisa once told me that the Windblume Festival is one of Mondstadt's biggest events of the year.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 collei 11.ogg Collei: I wanted to take this opportunity to give everyone a Windblume, as a token of my heartfelt gratitude for everything they've done to look after me...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 collei 12.ogg Collei: That's just an excuse, plain and simple.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 collei 13.ogg Collei: Wow, your teacher's... so nice.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: What can I say. For a skilled adventurer, this is just another day on the job.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: I'll have some.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: Tighnari. While we were on the road, we spotted something white, walking on two legs. Was that Paimon?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: Just after passing through Stone Gate.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Is that right...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: I thought that you'd maybe snacked on too many local... ground nuts.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: No? Not funny?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: Ground, you know, as in "ground up," but also "the ground"... ground nuts make you fall to the ground...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: ...I see. You must have been keeping quiet about this grievance for quite some time now.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: That's because I'm Cyno the Adventurer.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: Hmm? It's not?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: I understand. Then allow me to reintroduce myself. Before, you knew me as General Mahamatra Cyno. Now, please see me as Cyno the Adventurer.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 13.ogg Cyno: "Collei Lily."
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 14.ogg Cyno: Collei's Windblume. Maybe she should call it a "Collei Lily." It sounds very Mondstadt.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 15.ogg Cyno: There's also "Collei Flower," which would technically make more sense, but somehow it doesn't sound as nice.
(The group quietly looks at Cyno for a while)
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 16.ogg Cyno: I came to ensure Collei's safety.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 17.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 18.ogg Cyno: Also... there's the matter of a Genius Invokation TCG custom-made card back.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 19.ogg Cyno: Have you all played Genius Invokation TCG before?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 20a 1.ogg Cyno: And that is why I am proud to call you my friend.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 20b 1.ogg Cyno: Well, you should. For the sake of our continued friendship.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 21.ogg Cyno: When I first began contemplating getting a new card back, I asked around before eventually deciding to ask the legendary Mr. Calx for guidance.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 22.ogg Cyno: A friend of mine, Sawada, whom I play cards with on occasion, had been to Inazuma for the Irodori Festival. He told me that Calx was a Mondstadter, so I should try my luck there.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 23.ogg Cyno: You mean, he's a friend of yours?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 24.ogg Cyno: No, that is inaccurate. I came here principally to protect Collei.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 25.ogg Cyno: Not only me. Same applies to you too, doesn't it?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 26.ogg Cyno: ...Wait, you mean, you're Mr. Calx!?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 27.ogg Cyno: Ugh, you didn't have to say all that...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 28.ogg Cyno: Obviously.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 29.ogg Cyno: So. How much should I budget for the timeless masterpiece you will produce for me...?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 30.ogg Cyno: Any artwork fit to appear on the reverse of my card decks is by definition a timeless masterpiece! Even if I do say so myself.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 31.ogg Cyno: My jokes? You like them?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 cyno 32.ogg Cyno: Really? I didn't see you laughing.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh, Cyno, are you sure your eyes were working that day? Or maybe your hood was blocking your vision?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon always flies. There's no way she'd ever walk.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What hypothesis?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hey, Paimon's not your test subject!
Media:vo eqfh101 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Anyway, by your logic, wouldn't that mean that eating... say... Zaytun Peaches — that would make a sick Paimon peachy in no time, or something?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hey, not you too!
Media:vo eqfh101 5 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: You seem much cheerier now that you're here in Mondstadt, Cyno. Actually, it feels like you're a completely different person!
Media:vo eqfh101 5 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: ...What?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Wow, he just completely ignored the joke and carried on the conversation. Guess sometimes, that's the only way forward.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: How about you, Cyno?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Aha! So you DID have an ulterior motive!
Media:vo eqfh101 5 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Calx? Uh, isn't that...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Ohh, here it comes!
Media:vo eqfh101 5 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Will it be okay? Should we go over and take a look, too?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Not at all. We just came early to set everything up, since we happened to be free today.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Collei put up the tents so quickly, but still managed to tie very sturdy knots. You can really tell that she's a professional.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: I didn't do much apart from passing materials around...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: Would anyone like to try the nutrient-dense meal I made?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: What about you, Collei? It doesn't look like you've eaten very much. Is your appetite low at the moment?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: Hmm, so you have two different mental states? Almost like... different phases of matter? Interesting... I want to learn to do that, too!
Media:vo eqfh101 5 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: I feel the same about yours. Hmm, well, they definitely have quite different personalities, but they're similar when it comes to their character.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: Ah! My nutritional meal!
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Ugh... Are you quite finished, or were you going to sing each others praises till the moon rises? Come on, let's all sit down.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: That Sunshine Sprat was really very good. I didn't watch you cook it, but I believe that the prominent umami flavor of the dish owes itself to more than the fish alone.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Let me think... The aroma was quite uniform, unlike that of a spice blend. It was also unfamiliar to me, so I would venture that it was a Mondstadt specialty.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: As far as edible Mondstadt plant species are concerned, Calla Lilies are usually used in soups. So if I had to guess...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: Small Lamp Grass?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: I liked it a lot.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: I'm curious as to the exact ratio of ingredients...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Which day was this?
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: ...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: Think of this as part of the process of getting to know Cyno. On the bright side, these jokes show that he thinks of you as his friends.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: In fairness, you only saw him in his work mode while you were in Sumeru. He's actually like this most of the time when he's in a good mood.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 12.ogg Tighnari: Yeah, so that's another thing he does! He'll keep repeating something he thinks is funny until you stop trying to resist.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 13.ogg Tighnari: Plus, it was a good chance for Collei to get out and meet some new people.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 14.ogg Tighnari: ...Moving swiftly on...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 15.ogg Tighnari: ...Sumeru's been through some major changes recently, and things at work have only just started to calm down.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 16.ogg Tighnari: I don't get many opportunities to take a vacation, and this was a chance to join Collei on her trip while also learning a few things about Mondstadt's flora and fauna that I'll be able to pass on to my peers and students on my return. Two birds with one stone.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 17.ogg Tighnari: You most certainly did not. Collei's been here on the quiet numerous times, and this is the first time you felt the need to join.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 18.ogg Tighnari: Huh. So you're Calx... Cyno's been talking about you non-stop recently. He's intent on getting you to design a bespoke card back for him.
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 19.ogg Tighnari: Don't mind him — these TCG nut jobs are all like this...
Media:vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 20.ogg Tighnari: If I might interrupt, does anyone else smell something strange?
Media:vo eqfh101 6 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Ah, what a shame. You just missed a joke about windmills.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Perhaps I could join you? I'll be looking for inspiration for these card back illustrations.
(Amber and Eula run in)
Media:vo eqfh101 6 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: That's an Outrider for you.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: It's getting late, and we still have a lot lined up tomorrow. I suggest we all head back and get some rest.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Found you!
Media:vo eqfh101 6 ambor 02.ogg Amber: I knew I was onto something as soon as I saw the fire.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 ambor 03.ogg Amber: Actually, you didn't. Strictly speaking, you should have reported your plans first, but since two of our very own alchemists are here... I'm happy to look the other way, hehe...
Media:vo eqfh101 6 ambor 04.ogg Amber: Ah, yes, introductions! I'm Amber, and this is the Reconnaissance Company Captain, Eula, a good friend of mine.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 ambor 05.ogg Amber: Oh really? All positive, I hope...?
Media:vo eqfh101 6 ambor 06.ogg Amber: Haha, glad to know we've made a good impression so far! Anyway, we're just here to collect Collei, so don't let us interrupt your chat.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 ambor 07.ogg Amber: C'mon, Collei! We're gonna take you to check out a few scenic spots.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 collei 01.ogg Collei: You asked that last time too! ... Of course it was positive...
Media:vo eqfh101 6 collei 02.ogg Collei: Okay, great!
(Collei leaves)
Media:vo eqfh101 6 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Tomorrow morning.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: And you? What are your plans?
Media:vo eqfh101 6 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: I'd say... we hear the latest news about you every time you write to Collei.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: Heh... Still as high-energy as always.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Yes, we've met. She's Collei's most important friend, and for that we're also very grateful to her.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 eula 01.ogg Eula: Good evening. You're friends of Collei, yes? A pleasure to meet you.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Good thing Tighnari's nose is so sharp... Has he been in this kind of situation a lot before?
Media:vo eqfh101 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ohh, yeah! She's someone who needs your help!
Media:vo eqfh101 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Alright! We'll help out too.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Uh... Huh... right.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: That bad, huh? Hmm, now Paimon really wants to hear it for some reason...
Media:vo eqfh101 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh... did we break the fire safety rules or something?
Media:vo eqfh101 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Hmm? You know Amber?
Media:vo eqfh101 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: That's Amber for you. Her outgoing personality means she can make friends with just about anybody.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Phew. Only the base is burned. We can still use the cooking pot, it just needs a bit of a wash.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: *sigh* I know, it's just... I'm sorry to disappoint Cyno. I guess we'll have to do this again another day.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Ah, yes. I'm not sure if you've noticed...
Media:vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: Collei seems a little... depressed. I noticed she was in a low mood when everyone was talking.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: Remember that note she received?
Media:vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: I was just thinking. I wanna try solving this riddle and giving Collei the chance to accept the blessing.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: Exactly.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: Maybe she'll be willing to breathe into my test tube... But anyway, that can wait.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: As much as I'd like to make progress in my research, I'd prefer to see her smile.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 10.ogg Sucrose: You will? Then tell me, honestly... Do you... think that this prophecy is for real, too?
Media:vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 11.ogg Sucrose: Alright. Let's meet at the alchemy crafting bench in the city. I've got some thinking to do in the meantime.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 12.ogg Sucrose: We're back.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 13.ogg Sucrose: Wow, you have really sharp eyes!
Media:vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 14.ogg Sucrose: ...
Media:vo eqfh101 6 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Stop. Please. I don't need to hear it a fifth time.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Didn't you say you want to see the Dragon of the East at some point? When are you going?
Media:vo eqfh101 6 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: I'll go into the mountains to have a stroll and collect a few plants as samples.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Oh, Amber and Eula! The pleasure is ours. I've heard a lot about both of you from Collei.
Media:vo eqfh101 6 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: Alright. I'll start packing up.
Media:vo eqfh101 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: You're gonna get the Tone-Deaf Bard to check out that note, aren't you?
Media:vo eqfh101 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hehe, guess Paimon knows you pretty well, huh?
Media:vo eqfh101 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Knowing him, he should be hitting the taverns around this time!
Media:vo eqfh101 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: We can go corner him and make him answer our questions. Let's move!
Media:vo eqfh101 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Paimon called it! Tone-Deaf Bard, drinking as usual!
Media:vo eqfh101 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Put your drink down and get your game face on. We've got some important questions for you, mister.
Media:vo eqfh101 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So, what do you make of it?
Media:vo eqfh101 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Well, if you won't tell us the answer, could you at least tell us if this thing's worth a shot?
Media:vo eqfh101 8 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hmph, whatever. We weren't expecting much from you anyway.
Media:vo eqfh101 8 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: You can get back to guzzling wine and blowing wind now, hmph!
Media:vo eqfh101 8 venti 01.ogg Venti: Oho, it's been a while!
Media:vo eqfh101 8 venti 02.ogg Venti: Uh... Okay...
Media:vo eqfh101 8 venti 03.ogg Venti: Hehe, aren't you forgetting something? It's the Windblume Festival right now. You can't just go around asking people for help so blatantly.
Media:vo eqfh101 8 venti 04.ogg Venti: Sounds to me like you want a hint or two?
Media:vo eqfh101 8 venti 05.ogg Venti: Hehe, a fine answer.
Media:vo eqfh101 8 venti 06.ogg Venti: The person who wrote this prophecy is very powerful. If you manage to solve the riddle, good things are sure to happen.
Media:vo eqfh101 8 venti 07.ogg Venti: Also... I happen to know where this lantern is.
Media:vo eqfh101 8 venti 08.ogg Venti: Once you've found the four things, I'll even write the location down for you. Isn't that generous of me?
Media:vo eqfh101 8 venti 09.ogg Venti: Oh, woe is me... Paimon sees me as nothing more than a drunken wastrel...
Media:vo eqfh101 8 venti 10.ogg Venti: There are actually a great many things that we bards are required to do... It just happens that enjoying life is the most important one.
Media:vo eqfh101 8 venti 11.ogg Venti: Once this is over, would you like to join me for a drink?
Media:vo eqfh101 8 venti 12.ogg Venti: Y'know... A favor for a favor?
Media:vo eqfh101 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Sucrose! We've got some good news and some bad news. Which would you like to hear first?
Media:vo eqfh101 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh, really? Don't most people usually want to hear the good stuff first?
Media:vo eqfh101 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, alright then... Basically, we went to Windrise to divine the breeze.
Media:vo eqfh101 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: The wind said that the prophecy is real, and that your idea is a really good one.
Media:vo eqfh101 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Uh... Paimon ate the bad news, hehe~!
Media:vo eqfh101 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: ...
Media:vo eqfh101 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: ...Blame Cyno! If it's not funny, then it's his fault!
Media:vo eqfh101 9 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Whoa, whoa, slow down... Paimon's head is already starting to spin.
Media:vo eqfh101 9 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Could it be the "Windblume"?
Media:vo eqfh101 9 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Yay! Paimon was actually useful this time! Guess we have that Sweet Madame to thank, huh?
Media:vo eqfh101 9 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Sure thing. In the meantime, we'll also think about the other three riddles in the prophecy.
Media:vo eqfh101 9 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: But uh, since we're really going for this now... Shouldn't we say something to Collei about it?
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: "A flower that is not of this world." Hmm, not of this world...
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Um... Let's have the bad news first, I guess.
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: That doesn't sound like bad news... So what's the real bad news, then?
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: Hehe... It's fine. Well, that puts my mind at rest.
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: Now, back to the other issue I've been mulling over.
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: I was thinking about the flower that is "not of this world." It could mean a human-cultivated variety that doesn't occur in nature... But that's basically claiming that it doesn't come from this world in the first place, when actually it's just a variant of an existing breed.
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: So the initial question is: Can the flower's origins be traced back to a natural organism? If so, it cannot be correctly described as "not of this world."
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: But then... supposing we identified something outside of that category, whose job would it be to decide whether it belongs in this world or not? Then the question becomes: Do "of this world" and "from this world" mean the same thing... or is it deeper than that?
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: Okay. Um... I did have one other line of thought as well. What about a flower created using alchemy? Would that be "not of this world"?
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 10.ogg Sucrose: Albedo may know the answer, but asking him right away would be like asking the teacher for the answers to your exam paper.
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 11.ogg Sucrose: It would render our search for the truth meaningless. I'd rather try and figure this out for myself...
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 12.ogg Sucrose: Oh... now that you mention it, that's definitely a possibility.
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 13.ogg Sucrose: The Windblume doesn't refer to a specific flower. Everyone defines what it means for themselves.
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 14.ogg Sucrose: In which case, the "Windblume" doesn't exist in reality... Hmm. This does seem like a promising direction!
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 15.ogg Sucrose: I've made a note! Okay, I'd better go read up on this...
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 16.ogg Sucrose: I'll need some time to prepare. Could we meet up here in, say, two days' time?
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 17.ogg Sucrose: I originally wanted to leave it as a surprise for her, and I also didn't want to get her hopes up over nothing...
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 18.ogg Sucrose: But you're right, Paimon. I'll need to be careful how I word it... but I'll try to find some time over the next couple days to mention it to her.
Media:vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 19.ogg Sucrose: Alright. Thanks so much!
