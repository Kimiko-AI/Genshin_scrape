Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: It says in the notes that Eric "can't hold on anymore." That at least proves that it is possible to "hold on" up to a point.
 All thanks to you, Bennett. (+1 heart)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: Oh! Uh... heh, I didn't really do anything. You're the one who nailed this.
 All the other members are gone?
 Bennett...
 But it shows that fortunate outcomes do exist.
 Don't take it personally.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 12.ogg Bennett: Yeah, I felt really let down at first, but I'm pretty much used to it now. It's okay!
 Get hurt?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: Yeah, I guess that's what the notes are referring to when they say... "Eric can't hold on anymore"...
 Go ahead! We won't get anywhere just staring at them. (This dialogue option leads to Ending: No Wonder It's a Top-Class Commission.)

 The one on the left.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: That's the one I was thinking of too! Let's see...
 The one on the right.

 Hmm, how can I let you face the danger alone? (This dialogue option leads to Ending: Fortunate Outcome.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 14.ogg Bennett: Hmm... I could try it out myself...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 15.ogg Bennett: But... What do you think we should do? Let's do it your way!
 Take one each, activate them simultaneously.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904502 bennett 16.ogg Bennett: Well, that's a possibility... yeah.

 It's some very valuable guidance.

Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: Really! Then I'm honored, haha.

Media:vo bntcop001 1904503 bennett 13.ogg Bennett: Heh, don't say that! Adventurers should be free to do what they please, so leaving an adventure team is a completely normal thing to do.
 This is just one of the many possible outcomes.
 Two of us won't be enough...
 We need four people...
 We should at least to rock, paper, scissors...
 What's the deal with Benny's Adventure Team, anyway?
 Who says it's up to you?
 Why do I feel... it's a bit ominous?
 Yeah, piece of cake.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: Haha! That's the great adventurer I'm talking about! Awesome!
 You can do it, Bennett!
 You mean, the solution may be different from the previous room?
 You mean... you're the only one left?
 You're right, we shouldn't jump to conclusions.

Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Wow, that was quite a haul!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: This must be the proudest moment for any adventurer!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: Not only getting the chest, but having this golden opportunity to join you on an adventure. For me, that's a pretty major treasure already, hehe...

Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: But there's one other thing that I find the most amazing of all...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: The fact that nothing really bad happened to us this whole adventure. This is the first time in my whole adventure career that it's ever turned out this way!
 This is just one of the many possible outcomes.
 But it shows that fortunate outcomes do exist.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: That sounds very deep... but I think I get what you're saying.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: You are saying that no matter how unlucky I might be, there will always be times when luck is on my side, right?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: Yeah... This is a really big thing for me.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 11.ogg Bennett: And you know, I have a feeling that...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 12.ogg Bennett: ...It was your kindness and goodwill towards me that helped me avoid a lot of bad luck... even find a little good luck...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 13.ogg Bennett: Hehe, it's a bit embarrassing to say that out loud, but all in all, thank you... for everything!

Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 17.ogg Bennett: Remember what the notes say... Hmm...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 18.ogg Bennett: "The number of torches is not the hint for the activation sequence..."
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 19.ogg Bennett: "Perhaps... the sequence is related to the position of the torches on the ground."
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 20.ogg Bennett: Well, don't put too much pressure on yourself just because you're afraid I'll get hurt!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904504 bennett 21.ogg Bennett: Just go with your gut and do it.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904505 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Go stand by the mechanism, and when we're both ready, let's trigger them!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904505 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Go stand by the mechanism, and when we're both ready, let's trigger them!

(After activating the mechanism)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904507 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Cooool! The door is open. We got it right!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904507 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Good thing we went with your idea. You definitely live up to your reputation.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904507 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: And... I haven't had this feeling of working together with friends in ages. I've really missed it, hehe.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904507 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: Anyway, let's move on!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Wow, that was quite a haul!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: This must be the proudest moment for any adventurer!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: Not only getting the chest, but having this golden opportunity to join you on an adventure. For me, that's a pretty major treasure already, hehe...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: Really! Then I'm honored, haha.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: Hmm... I guess you're right, finding chests is where the real romance of being an adventurer lies!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: But there's one other thing that I find the most amazing of all...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: The fact that nothing really bad happened to us this whole adventure. This is the first time in my whole adventure career that it's ever turned out this way!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: That sounds very deep... but I think I get what you're saying.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: You are saying that no matter how unlucky I might be, there will always be times when luck is on my side, right?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: Yeah... This is a really big thing for me.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 11.ogg Bennett: And you know, I have a feeling that...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 12.ogg Bennett: ...It was your kindness and goodwill towards me that helped me avoid a lot of bad luck... even find a little good luck...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 13.ogg Bennett: Hehe, it's a bit embarrassing to say that out loud, but all in all, thank you... for everything!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904506 bennett 14.ogg Bennett: I hope I get to go on another adventure with you soon!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904507 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Cooool! The door is open. We got it right!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904507 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Good thing we went with your idea. You definitely live up to your reputation.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904507 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: And... I haven't had this feeling of working together with friends in ages. I've really missed it, hehe.

Media:vo bntcop001 1904508 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: There doesn't seem to be anything here...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904508 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's so dusty. Paimon bets no one has been here in a long, long time.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904508 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hey that looks like a notebook!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904508 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Let's grab it and check it out with Bennett, shall we?

Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Ow! Argh... it's okay, it's okay. If this is as bad as it gets, I can handle it.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Ah! *cough* *cough* I'm fine... don't let me influence your... thinking...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: Ugh... is it over yet... I think I...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: I'm... sorry...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: I don't think my body... can... take this anymore...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: I'm sorry... I failed you... (-5 Hearts)

Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: You... you solved it?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: Haha! That's the great adventurer I'm talking about! Awesome!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: Oh! Uh... heh, I didn't really do anything. You're the one who nailed this.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904511 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: Let's go and open the chest, shall we? I can't wait!
Oh, how I wish to know...
One other word of advice:
The number or torches does not indicate the sequence of operation... We made that mistake, and paid a painful price. Perhaps... the order has something to do with the position of the torches on the ground?
The person operating the mechanism by the door takes on an enormous risk.
What is the answer?
