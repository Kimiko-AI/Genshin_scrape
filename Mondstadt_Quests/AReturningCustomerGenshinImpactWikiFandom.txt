(If delicious)
Siegfria: ...Ah, they're all gone.
Siegfria: The mouthfeel of those vegetables... the perfectly paired flavors of the ham and the lotus... and that soup...
Siegfria: This is it — this is the flavor that I tasted the last time!
(If normal)
Siegfria: The freshness of the ham, the mouthfeel of the vegetables, and this faint spiciness...
Siegfria: Hmm, this is not bad. It's a really good serving of Jade Parcels!
(If suspicious)
Siegfria: Ugh... These vegetables are so dry, and it feels like there are some ingredients that weren't cooked all the way through...
Siegfria: It's a far cry from what I had before... is this some new method of cooking that you came up with?
Siegfria: There's just something off about it... but I can still use it for reference.
 I'll see it done.
Siegfria: Great! Thank you so much. I'll be waiting over here.
Siegfria: Hehe... I'll finally be able to eat Jade Parcels again...
 Quest DescriptionSiegfria can't stop thinking about the delectable Jade Parcels. Oh how she wants to taste it again...
 What do you need?
 Would you like anything else?
Siegfria: Ugh, well... I'd also like to eat other things. But if I tried to eat everything, then I wouldn't be able to eat anything at all.
Siegfria: So I'd like to get a firm grasp on how Jade Parcels taste first.
Siegfria: *sigh* If only you could make those Jade Parcels for me a few more times. There are still many intricacies to them that I have yet to work out.
Siegfria: ...Ah, they're all gone.
Siegfria: Are the Jade Parcels ready yet?
Siegfria: Do you still recall the Jade Parcels that you made the previous time?
Siegfria: From the cook-off, with Xiangling? That was me, Siegfria!
Siegfria: Great! Thank you so much. I'll be waiting over here.
Siegfria: Hehe, do you remember now? Anyway, you've come at a great time. Could I... ask you to help me with something?
Siegfria: Hehe... I'll finally be able to eat Jade Parcels again...
Siegfria: Hmm, this is not bad. It's a really good serving of Jade Parcels!
Siegfria: How am I already hungry again...
Siegfria: I do know the recipe, and I have been able to figure out how to make it, but it doesn't quite match the flavor it had when you made it.
Siegfria: I feel like if I get to try it a few more times, I can recreate that flavor too!
Siegfria: It was so delicious, I can still taste it, even now.
Siegfria: It's a far cry from what I had before... is this some new method of cooking that you came up with?
Siegfria: Next we meet, I will definitely be able to make a batch of perfect Jade Parcels.
Siegfria: Oh, it's you! Wonderful. Do you still remember me?
Siegfria: So I wanted to give it a try and make some myself, but... it always feels like there's something missing...
Siegfria: So I'd like to get a firm grasp on how Jade Parcels taste first.
Siegfria: So, could I ask you to make some Jade Parcels for me to try?
Siegfria: Thanks for coming over just to make me this dish. I need to go back and make some notes.
Siegfria: The freshness of the ham, the mouthfeel of the vegetables, and this faint spiciness...
Siegfria: The mouthfeel of those vegetables... the perfectly paired flavors of the ham and the lotus... and that soup...
Siegfria: There's just something off about it... but I can still use it for reference.
Siegfria: This is great! I'll finally get to taste the Jade Parcels you make again.
Siegfria: This is it — this is the flavor that I tasted the last time!

Siegfria: Ugh... These vegetables are so dry, and it feels like there are some ingredients that weren't cooked all the way through...
Siegfria: When that time comes, do swing by to have a taste.
