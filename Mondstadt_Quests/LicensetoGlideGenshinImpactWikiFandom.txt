 I can't say I really grasped the rules...
 I mean, I read it but...
 I'm ready.
 Let me get myself ready.
Media:vo ablq002 4 ambor 03b.ogg Amber: Sure. But you gotta be 100% ready to glide.
(Dialogue ends, talking to her again repeats this dialogue branch from the beginning.)
 Let's try this again.
Media:vo ablq002 4 ambor 03a.ogg Amber: Cool. You'll make it this time, I just know it!
 Quest DescriptionAmber has specially prepared a gliding exam for you. She has also provided a gliding manual, which she has asked you to read before taking the exam.
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Great, you're here! Did you have a good read-through of the gliding manual? Got all the rules down?
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 02.ogg Amber: Sounds like it was a real drag. I would know, I've been there...
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 03.ogg Amber: The gliding manual is super dry... I couldn't get into it at all. Don't tell Jean though...
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 04.ogg Amber: Cool stories? Oh, you must mean the example cases in the Appendix.
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 05.ogg Amber: Some of them I like. My favorite one is about the illegal Anemo Slime take-off.
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 06.ogg Amber: Apparently, if you pop an Anemo Slime and take off in the burst of wind, it shoots you up really, really high... I really wanna try it!
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 07.ogg Amber: Ah... What...?
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 08.ogg Amber: Lemme take a look... Shoot, this is the storybook I used to read as a kid!
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 09.ogg Amber: Oops, sorry! I put both books in the same pile and must have grabbed the wrong one when I was leaving.
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 10.ogg Amber: Ahh... This is so embarrassing...
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 11.ogg Amber: It's because... Maybe deep down inside, that fairytale is the thing that truly taught me how to glide...
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 12.ogg Amber: "What you lacked was not wind. It's courage that's allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world."
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 13.ogg Amber: Reading that gave me the courage to glide, to become an Outrider, and to become the Gliding Champion of Mondstadt.
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 14.ogg Amber: ...But anyway let's get back to the exam!
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 15.ogg Amber: Don't be nervous, just glide like you're used to.
Media:vo ablq002 2 ambor 16.ogg Amber: Okay then. You just need to follow the marked route to the finish.
Media:vo ablq002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Really? Hmm... Paimon thought there were some pretty cool stories in the gliding manual.
Media:vo ablq002 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: No, not that story. Paimon meant the one with the little bird who wanted to learn to fly.
Media:vo ablq002 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: How in the heck do you confuse a bedtime story with an instruction manual?
Media:vo ablq002 4 ambor 01.ogg Amber: You gotta focus on your technique when you're gliding.
Media:vo ablq002 4 ambor 02.ogg Amber: If you wanna try again, just let me know.
Media:vo ablq002 4 ambor 03a.ogg Amber: Cool. You'll make it this time, I just know it!
Media:vo ablq002 4 ambor 03b.ogg Amber: Sure. But you gotta be 100% ready to glide.
Media:vo ablq002 5 ambor 01.ogg Amber: You nailed it! But it's no surprise, given the way you handle your glider in a storm.
Media:vo ablq002 5 ambor 02.ogg Amber: The next part of the exam is in Mondstadt. See you there, don't keep me waiting!
Media:vo ablq002 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Alrighty then â€” you heard her. Back to the city! Let's not keep her waiting!
