 Abyss Mage? Never heard such a name.
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 09a.ogg Venti: They are from the Abyss Order, an organization comprised of non-human beings. They despise mankind.
 I think I've heard of them before in Mondstadt...
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 09b.ogg Venti: Correct. They are from the Abyss Order, an organization comprised of non-human beings. They despise mankind.
 I want to know more about the Anemo God.
 Oh, ah... that...
 Quest DescriptionThe mysterious fellow claimed to be a bard named Venti, but left on his own accord before you could get him to explain his relationship with the dragon. You follow him to the giant tree at Windrise.
 That was ...me?
 Yes, someone told me about Dvalin's past.
Media:vo mdaq042 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh... ahhh... it's because gods...
Media:vo mdaq042 2 venti 01.ogg Venti: Oh? What are you doing here?
Media:vo mdaq042 2 venti 02.ogg Venti: Though I was just wondering if you would happen to follow me...
Media:vo mdaq042 2 venti 03.ogg Venti: You speak of the God of Anemo, Barbatos? He already disappeared from Mondstadt a long time ago.
Media:vo mdaq042 2 venti 04.ogg Venti: Liyue and Inazuma's respective gods of Geo and Electro are still present, but Mondstadt has seen many a moon since they last saw their own god.
Media:vo mdaq042 2 venti 05.ogg Venti: Why do you wish to know about the God of Anemo? Does it have something to do with Dvalin?
Media:vo mdaq042 2 venti 06.ogg Venti: Just how is it that everyone sees Stormterror? I'm quite curious.
Media:vo mdaq042 2 venti 07.ogg Venti: That said, there's no need to rush...
Media:vo mdaq042 2 venti 08.ogg Venti: I have not been back in a while, it seems there are a few who are unhappy with my arrival.
Media:vo mdaq043 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: The wind... I can't... open my eyes...
Media:vo mdaq043 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What is a creature like that doing out here in such a calm place?
Media:vo mdaq043 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You think it was going after that green guy?
Media:vo mdaq043 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: (Traveler)... His relationship with the wind seems even deeper than yours...
Media:vo mdaq043 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Degra... dation?
Media:vo mdaq043 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So... how exactly did you get poisoned?
Media:vo mdaq043 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: The Mondstadt Cathedral? To do what exactly?
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 01.ogg Venti: Seems the dragon wasn't the only thing affected by this change in the wind...
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 02.ogg Venti: Now then, you were saying someone had told you about the dragon?
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 03.ogg Venti: Is that so? Quite the scholar I must say, that Lisa.
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 04.ogg Venti: She's not wrong. The conflict has reached this point, only because both sides have resorted to the use of force.
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 05.ogg Venti: His hate, however, did not arise from the people not making tribute to The Four Winds.
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 06.ogg Venti: Nor was it born from his own nature, but instead came about as a product of his degradation.
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 07.ogg Venti: The black blood flowing through his heart has been torturing him for years.
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 08.ogg Venti: That's what has allowed him to be led astray by the lies of the Abyss Mage.
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 09a.ogg Venti: They are from the Abyss Order, an organization comprised of non-human beings. They despise mankind.
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 09b.ogg Venti: Correct. They are from the Abyss Order, an organization comprised of non-human beings. They despise mankind.
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 10.ogg Venti: I don't know where they come from. All I know is that they hold deep hatred towards the human world.
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 11.ogg Venti: Many hilichurls out in the wild take orders from them and act as their weapons.
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 12.ogg Venti: Before arriving here, I too was like Dvalin, cursed and left to waste.
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 13.ogg Venti: But now, before us stands the Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero, the place from which Mondstadt rose.
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 14.ogg Venti: The wind amongst the branches is good, I love the way it smells...
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 15.ogg Venti: Being here with you beneath this great tree feels like when the tear was purified earlier. Like the poison is leaving my body...
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 16.ogg Venti: Mmmmmmm... Feels much better.
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 17.ogg Venti: Ahh... that would be because I tried to communicate with Dvalin earlier, but was... interrupted...
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 18.ogg Venti: As a result, not only did I not manage to help Dvalin break his curse, but instead, was also infected myself!
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 19.ogg Venti: Yes, it was you!
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 20.ogg Venti: So, to make up for it, (Traveler), you're coming with me to the Cathedral!
Media:vo mdaq043 4 venti 21.ogg Venti: To claim a certain "Holy Lyre der Himmel."
You tell Venti what Lisa explained to you...
