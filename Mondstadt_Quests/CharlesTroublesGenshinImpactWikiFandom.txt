 Okay, I'll see what I can do.
 Okay, but my next drink here had better be on the house!

Media:vo qinlq003 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Sounds about right!
 Quest DescriptionHas Charles managed to get hold of the tax forms he needs?
Media:vo qinlq003 1 charles 01.ogg Charles: Please, allow me, ma'am.
Media:vo qinlq003 1 charles 02.ogg Charles: I just took a rather important order, but unfortunately we've run completely dry and the delivery from the winery is behind schedule.
Media:vo qinlq003 1 charles 03.ogg Charles: If it's not too much trouble, could you go and do something about this logistical nuisance?
Media:vo qinlq003 1 charles 04.ogg Charles: *sigh* It came in at the last minute. Literally, just a few seconds ago.
Media:vo qinlq003 1 charles 05.ogg Charles: Heh... I'm positive that next time my boss Master Diluc is here, he'll pick up the tab for you.
Media:vo qinlq003 1 lisa 01.ogg Lisa: Oh, hello darling. You're quite right. After I heard about poor Jean, I thought I might lend a hand with some of her more literary duties.
Media:vo qinlq003 1 lisa 02.ogg Lisa: Oh wait a moment... Actually, Charles here was wonderingâ€”
Media:vo qinlq003 1 lisa 03.ogg Lisa: Exactly, hence the urgency.
Media:vo qinlq003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Lisa? Are you here about the tax return?
Media:vo qinlq003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Cool, well if we're no longer needed here, we'll be on our way.
Media:vo qinlq003 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What's so urgent about this order?
Media:vo qinlq003 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Sounds about right!
Media:vo qinlq003 2 ernesrt 01.ogg Ernest: Have you come to rescue me? I've been waiting long enough.
Media:vo qinlq003 2 ernesrt 02.ogg Ernest: In all the time I've been working at the winery, this is the first time I've been robbed by hilichurls. *sigh*
Media:vo qinlq003 2 ernesrt 03.ogg Ernest: If you'd taken any longer, I don't know what I would have done.
Media:vo qinlq003 2 ernesrt 04.ogg Ernest: Just as well. Then... please escort this transporter to the end of the road.
Media:vo qinlq003 2 ernesrt 05.ogg Ernest: And be careful with it. Just beating up the hilichurls is not the aim here. You'd better make sure the goods stay intact because I certainly don't have the Mora to replace them.
Media:vo qinlq003 2 ernesrt 06.ogg Ernest: I'll be waiting up ahead.
(The escort of Transport Balloon starts)
Media:vo qinlq003 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So this is where Charles' delivery got to.
Media:vo qinlq003 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Fear not. (Traveler) here is a hilichurl exterminator extraordinaire!
Media:vo qinlq003 4 ernesrt 01.ogg Ernest: Thank you, my friend. I thought I was in deep trouble this time, it's a good thing you showed up.
Media:vo qinlq003 4 ernesrt 02.ogg Ernest: I'll put in a good word for you with the gentlemen at the winery.
