(If the Eye of the Storm was defeated)
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: ...Exhausting... It was too far up in the air, I couldn't get to it...
 Choosing an appropriate enemy is also a part of your training...
 Could you really recognize Noelle from that distance?
 If it were me just now, I would have gone to Amber or Lisa for help.
 In the future, don't leave everything to Noelle.
 It is precisely because the power of a single knight is limited that the Knights of Favonius was formed. Don't you think?
 It's because protecting others is the source of your strength.
 Just glad you're okay.
 Let's do it together.
 Noelle, why don't you choose the final training target?
 Quest DescriptionNoelle has great strength but is never able to use it in real fights. You arrange some training to help her gain more practical combat experience...
 Quest DescriptionWith your help, Noelle seems to have grasped some of the essentials of live combat and decides to try it out on a nearby hilichurl camp...
 Sound like you're a little too dependent on her.
 The intention was different.
 This is no reason for you to rely on her though.
 This wasn't training... you were trying to protect someone.
 Those weren't weak hilichurls.
 Unity and teamwork allow each knight to better utilize their strengths.
 We were quite far away...
 You've gotten stronger.
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: I see... Noted!
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: The next target is... an Eye of the Storm!?
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: No... the Eye of the Storm is getting away!
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Ugh... It was too far up in the air, I couldn't get to it...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: ...Exhausting... It was too far up in the air, I couldn't get to it...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: If only Amber or Miss Lisa were here...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: No! I can't think like that. As a Knight, I must rely on my own strength...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Huh? But...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: That makes sense... If only I'd fought together with you just now...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: "The camaraderie and solidarity of its members form the backbone of the Knights of Favonius..."
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: So that's what Article 8 of the Knights of Favonius Handbook really means...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: I never... looked at it that way before...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 13.ogg Noelle: Me? ...You think I can choose a suitable target?
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 14.ogg Noelle: Really? Let me think...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 15.ogg Noelle: ...I should avoid enemies that I find difficult... and consider the power of teamwork... hmm...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 16.ogg Noelle: Hmmm... Ah! I've got it!
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 17.ogg Noelle: I heard from Master Jean that there was a hilichurl camp nearby, that often attacks traveling merchants.
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 18.ogg Noelle: Even though driving away hilichurls is usually something for the Knights...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 19.ogg Noelle: Maybe this time... I can do it!
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 noelle 20.ogg Noelle: Great, you and me!
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Here we are! Let's start with Geo Slimes...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Piece of cake! Noelle's got moves!
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Maybe we should try a different opponent...
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? There are Dendro Slimes hiding here!
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hmm... that looked a bit tough for Noelle. Perhaps Dendro Slimes aren't her forte.
Media:vo noecop001 1906501 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Still, avoiding unfavorable battles is a big part of combat strategy!
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 01.ogg ???: Noeeeelle! Noeeeelle!
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 02.ogg Henning: Th—Thank the Anemo Archon! Finally, I'm saved...
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 03.ogg Henning: Ah... and thanks to Noelle and the Honorary Knight too...
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 04.ogg Henning: If it hadn't been for you two, I can't imagine what would have happened.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 05.ogg Henning:  You guys are here to save me... right?
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 06.ogg Henning: Haha... I think I wanted to say "help," or "Barbatos protect me," or something to that effect...
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 07.ogg Henning: I didn't even realize that I'd called out Noelle's name instead.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 08.ogg Henning: I guess in Mondstadt we're just so used to calling Noelle's name when we're in trouble.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 09.ogg Henning: Huh? Not too fierce? I was so scared I couldn't even move my legs.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 10.ogg Henning: You know, I think you're right!
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 11.ogg Henning: Whenever Noelle is helping us out, she's usually more powerful than in training!
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 12.ogg Henning: Ahaha... Absolutely. No more of that.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 henning 13.ogg Henning: ...In any case, I'm extremely grateful to you both.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Who's that? I—I need to help!
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: We were training nearby and happened to hear you calling my name. Luckily, we got here just in time.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Oh, it's fine! It's an honor to be able to help everyone.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: Not to mention, I might not have registered Henning's cry if that weren't the case.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 05.ogg Noelle: Still... good thing the hilichurls we encountered weren't too fierce. Thankfully, I was able to handle them.
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 06.ogg Noelle: R—Really?
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 07.ogg Noelle: I just did what I usually do...
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 08.ogg Noelle: Ah, I guess so...
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 09.ogg Noelle: I did have my mind set on not letting Henning get hurt...
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 10.ogg Noelle: So if my intention is different, it can have a big effect on the outcome...
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 11.ogg Noelle: N—No problem, merely fulfilling my duties as a maid of Favonius!
Media:vo noecop001 1906502 noelle 12.ogg Noelle: Maid Noelle of the Knight of Favonius, at your service!
