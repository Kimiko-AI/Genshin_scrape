 (Barbara needs rescuing from the crowd...)
 (Darn...)
 (Looks like we might need to intervene...)
 (This is bad...)
 (Uh oh...)
 Ah yes, the knight...
 And how many members does the group have?
 Barbara is on official business right now.
 Barbara's currently on leave, please don't disturb her. (-1 heart)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900902 schulz 02.ogg Schulz: Barbara-sama? On leave? Phew... For a moment, I thought I was disturbing her work...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900902 schulz 03.ogg Schulz: Barbara-sama! Can I get an autograph?
 (This is bad...)
(Failed to persuade Schulz)
 Barbara's currently on leave, please don't disturb her. (-1 heart)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900903 herman 02.ogg Herman: Uh... If she's on leave then... an autograph won't be a problem. Right?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900903 herman 03.ogg Herman: Barbara-sama, I — ahem, my daughter, eh-he — would love an autograph. Ellin really is your biggest fan!
 (Uh oh...)
(Failed to persuade Herman)
 Barbara's working right now, please don't disturb her.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900902 schulz 04.ogg Schulz: You... You must be the Honorary Knight! What are you and Barbara-sama doing he—
 We're... on official business.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900902 schulz 05.ogg Schulz: Uh... Of course! Barbara-sama is working after all... Forgive me, I'll leave you in peace.
(Succeeded to persuade Schulz)
 I get the feeling you're more popular than the average sister...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 35.ogg Barbara: Yeah, it's a little embarrassing... Do you know what an "idol" is?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 36.ogg Barbara: I guess you've heard that I... sometimes sing for the people in Mondstadt?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 37.ogg Barbara: I can use the power of my Vision to heal physical wounds, but it's no use on someone afflicted by sadness.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 38.ogg Barbara: I found out in a magazine that there was such a thing as an "idol."
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 39.ogg Barbara: In the magazine, it said that an idol was... a person that spreads love and hope through song and dance.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 40.ogg Barbara: I don't know if it's really possible, but... at least the residents of Mondstadt seem to like my singing.
 There was once an idol who stopped a war with their singing.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 41.ogg Barbara: R—Really? That's so impressive...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 42.ogg Barbara: Do you know that idol? They sound like a mighty Vision bearer.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 43.ogg Barbara: Still, using song and dance to heal the sick of heart... It's easier said than done.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 44.ogg Barbara: I don't know if I'm up to it. I'm not even very good at being a deaconess...
 Why, sure you are.
 You're already a very gifted healer.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 45.ogg Barbara: Aw, if that really is true... then that's amazing.
 I temporarily persuaded them to beat it.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Whew... I shouldn't be saying this but... thanks for intervening.
 I've waited longer...
 If it's Barbara's style you're after, you could start by being considerate to others.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900904 susie 04.ogg Susie: Uhh, sure... considerate to others... Huh? Aren't you that Honorary Knight? You and Barbara-sama must be...
 Uh — we're... on official business.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900904 susie 05.ogg Susie: Official business? Oh, I—I thought... Apologies. I—I just got so excited when I saw Barbara-sama...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900904 susie 06.ogg Susie: Yes, you're right... Being considerate to others is the right place to start.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900904 susie 07.ogg Susie: ...Barbara-sama and the Honorary Knight in the same place — this must be incredibly important official business... I—I'll take my leave.
(Succeeded to persuade Susie)
 Isn't it a little exhausting?
 Just now, in the city... why didn't you just tell them you were on leave and walk away?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 13.ogg Barbara: There's more than one answer to that question.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 14.ogg Barbara: A deaconess shouldn't ever be self-interested or let other people down...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 15.ogg Barbara: But at the end of the day, it's like my father said: I just don't know how to turn people away.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 16.ogg Barbara: My father and Sister Victoria always told me, if I wanted to become a proper deaconess, I would have to learn how to turn away others.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 17.ogg Barbara: But I've never been able to... When I see somebody in need, I lend a hand without a second thought.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 18.ogg Barbara: If I see somebody struggling, I want to help them solve the problem. If somebody comes to me with a request, I can't help but do my best.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 19.ogg Barbara: No matter how tiring, I'm happy as long as I can bring a smile to everybody.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 20.ogg Barbara: *sigh* Perhaps... I'm not a proper deaconess after all.
 Please don't disturb her, Barbara's currently on leave. (-1 heart)
Media:vo bblcop001 1900904 susie 02.ogg Susie: Oh — perfect! I've got so much to learn from Barbara-sama. She'd never have the time if she was working...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900904 susie 03.ogg Susie: Please, Barbara-sama, teach me your style! How can I be more like you?
 (Darn...)
(Failed to persuade Susie)
 Quest DescriptionAfter helping to clean up the Cathedral, you get ready to meet Barbara at The Cat's Tail.
 That sudden crowd back there in the city... you must be exhausted.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 21.ogg Barbara: Hehe, I'm so used to it by now, but thanks for wanting to intervene.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 22.ogg Barbara: Usually, the Knights of Favonius end up arriving to restore order. Then someone from the Church comes to escort me away.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 23.ogg Barbara: It's happened so many times already, I don't really notice it anymore.
 Isn't it a little exhausting?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 24.ogg Barbara: Of course! More than a little, to say the least...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 25.ogg Barbara: But exhaustion for the sake of not letting everybody down is okay.
 There was once an idol who stopped a war with their singing.
 They came to their senses once I'd given them the lowdown.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: The lowdown... You mean, you persuaded them to leave for now...?
 They're gonna keep asking for more and more...
 Uh — we're... on official business.
 We're... on official business.
 What's the Barbara Fan Club?

Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 26.ogg Barbara: Heh, that thing? Uhh... It's a group of my Mondstadt... supporters.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 27.ogg Barbara: But I'm usually in the Cathedral. The knights and sisters stationed outside the Church won't let them in.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 28.ogg Barbara: So they support me in other ways — cleaning the Cathedral, helping their fellow citizens with difficult matters, stuff like that.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 29.ogg Barbara: It's... very considerate, though sometimes they get carried away.
 And how many members does the group have?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 30.ogg Barbara: Uh, I'm not really sure... but of the ones I know, there's Mr. Albert and Mr. Huffman.
 Ah yes, the knight...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 31.ogg Barbara: Oh, do you know Mr. Huffman? He's a very strict knight, not to mention disciplined.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 32.ogg Barbara: He's never asked for my autograph or tried to make conversation. Every time he comes to the Cathedral on official business, his face is a picture of seriousness.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 33.ogg Barbara: I'd never have known if I hadn't overheard Mr. Albert talking about it.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 34.ogg Barbara: When I found out, I had someone deliver my autograph to him. I hope he was happy with it.
 Why, sure you are.
 You don't look too good...
 You look exhausted...
 You won't mind if I check in with Ellin on that? Looks like she's training, right over th—
Media:vo bblcop001 1900903 herman 04.ogg Herman: Ah!? W—Wait! I, uh...
 Barbara is on official business right now.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900903 herman 05.ogg Herman: Oh, is that right! Well then, uh... I'll leave her to it. Ellin looks busy with her training, some other time perhaps...
(Succeeded to persuade Herman)
 You're already a very gifted healer.
Barbara appeases her fans while the Traveler waits, and waits...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Uh... Th—Thank you for all your support... P—Please, one at a time...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Ah, I—I guess you could say that...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Oh, is that so? Hehe... A—Alright, just one moment...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: O—Oh, really? Well, I—I am still learning and growing myself...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: I—I guess all I can say is... Do your best every day!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: Ohh... Oh my...

Media:vo bblcop001 1900901 schulz 01.ogg Schulz: Barbara-sama, I never expected I would have a chance to meet you here today! Are you here attending to matters for the Church?

Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: I understand everybody's enthusiasm, but the longer I stay here the more people will gather. It's always been that way.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: I just don't know how to turn them away. In the end, the Knights of Favonius always have to come and restore order.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: *sigh* If only I had your way with words...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: Here, it's the Fantastic Summer-Serendipity Coral Sparkling Tea you wanted. I ordered this one especially for you.

Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 15.ogg Barbara: You look like you're about to fall asleep! I feel terrible. It was me who invited you for a drink, and here I am wasting your time...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 16.ogg Barbara: Here, it's the Fantastic Summer-Serendipity Coral Sparkling Tea you wanted. I ordered this one especially for you.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 17.ogg Barbara: At least Miss Margaret didn't make our drinks in advance. The flavor would've changed completely by now...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 18.ogg Barbara: Hehe, how can I put this... Those relaxing moments of freedom in Wolvendom...? The rush just now kinda ruined that for me.

Media:vo bblcop001 1900905 barbara 20.ogg Barbara: Although, perhaps you can stay with me a while longer? Let's take a stroll outside the city and finish our drinks.

Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Come to think of it, this is the first time we've gone for a walk together.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: When I heard you'd received the title of Honorary Knight, I thought you'd turn out to be more of a solemn character.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: But now that I've met you, I can't quite believe it. I never thought... O—Oh! I hope I'm not offending you!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: What I mean is, for someone as young as you to achieve the title of Honorary Knight... It's amazing!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: Jean... must really believe in you to grant you this title.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: I hope I can be as great as you one day, so I can help everybody around me too.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: But for now... all I can do is sing.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: ...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: Ah! So sorry, always thinking about myself...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: ...We've walked a long way — why don't we take a break up ahead?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: It looks so peaceful here, nobody's passing through except us. Let's rest for a while.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900906 barbara 13.ogg Barbara: There's more than one answer to that question.
