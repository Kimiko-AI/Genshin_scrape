Media:vo dialog mdaq067b diluc 02.ogg Diluc: We've come this far, there's no turning back now. We'll just have to deal with them one by one.
Media:vo dialog mdaq067b qin 01.ogg Jean: There's no time to waste. We need to get these light actuators unlocked.
Media:vo dialog mdaq067b qin 02.ogg Jean: It seems there are three of them. Looks like they can only be unlocked one at a time.
Media:vo dialog mdaq067b venti 01.ogg Venti: Okay! Give it a go!

Media:vo mdaq067b 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: ...Why did Dvalin pick a place filled with puzzles and seals as his lair? Doesn't he get annoyed coming back home?

Media:vo mdaq067b 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: It seems two of the halos have become solid ground!

Media:vo mdaq068 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's done!
Media:vo mdaq068 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It looks like that place leads deeper inside.
Venti: I've never encountered such annoying historical relics as these.
Venti: This light actuator is connecting to the others...
