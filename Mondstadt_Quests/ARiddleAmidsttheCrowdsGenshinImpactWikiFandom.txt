 (Collei seems to be wrapping gifts, and now she's frantically trying to hide it. I wonder who they're for?)
 (It feels pretty good to just relax and take in the scenery after all that great food.)
 ...
 ...I understand.
 All great qualities, but that says nothing about her identity...
 Alright, I guess I'd better go get Paimon some food.
 Are you eligible for this one, Sucrose?
 Are you interested in it too?
 Bye for now, everyone! Timaeus, please try to stay safe.
 Greetings, everyone. And happy Windblume Festival.
 Hear that? ...It's the sound of Mora pouring out of my wallet...
 Hello, Mika. Nice to meet you.
 Hi everyone, long time no see.
 Hi, Mika. Good to see you again.
 Huh? Why him?
 I'll let you know if we find the answer.
 I'm not drinking today. But thank you for offering.
 Maybe... Diluc?
 No problem.
 Not necessarily, but you have a point.
 Perhaps... an astrologer, then?
 Quest DescriptionEven though the clues are few and vague, you and Sucrose continue to work at uncovering the mystery behind the prophecy...
 Should we order something for you?
 That makes sense.
 This prophecy seems very strict...
 Understood. How has progress been on your end?
 What gives you that impression?
 You'd count as an expert too, you know.
(Traveler): (A paper with a simple map and something like an incantation on it.)
(Traveler): (Ah yes, his secret alter ego: the Darknight Hero. He must have to deny it if anyone asks. In that sense, he has a complicated relationship with the truth.)
(Traveler): (It looks like...)
After bidding farewell to Sucrose and Collei...
As the breeze picks up, Collei tells her life story... from her childhood to her recent recovery from Eleazar.
At that moment, Sucrose and Collei arrived at Stormbearer Mountains...
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Greetings, Lisa. Though I'm sure you've been aware of my presence in Mondstadt for some time already.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: Yes. It's just as Professor Cyrus said — shared aspirations always have a way of bringing people into each other's orbit.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: Hmm. I'm not sure that describes me very aptly these days, given that I'm now the General Mahamatra. Still, if we're going to talk about ways with words, I think my deadpan humor is far superior than our professor's.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: ...You make a good point.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Yes. It's very nice. I think I'm starting to understand your reasons for leaving the Akademiya.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: If our professor had been as sensible as you, he would have had a much easier time in his working life. Being stubborn doesn't help anybody.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: That's all in the past now. Besides, Professor thankfully didn't treat me like a test subject for the priest's power like the higher-ups had hoped, even though I was a desert-dweller.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: Instead, he gave me the tools I needed to lead the life I have today. He adopted me, educated me, taught me how to fit into society... I am very grateful to him.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: By virtue of being another of his students, you are as much a part of professor's family as I. It's perfectly natural for a daughter to inherit her father's conversation style.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: ...Um... I—I'd rather you didn't...
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 01.ogg Lisa: Why, if it isn't my underclassman, Cyno. What a pleasant surprise it is to see you in Mondstadt during the Windblume Festival.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 02.ogg Lisa: Oh dear, looks like you've seen right through me. But I was in no hurry. I knew we'd see each other sooner or later.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 03.ogg Lisa: Hehe, he always has such a poetic way of wording things. I suppose that's the one respect in which I've taken after him, while in your case...
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 04.ogg Lisa: Yes, it's his wit and eccentricities that have left their mark on you.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 05.ogg Lisa: Is that so? Strange, I heard that you're just Cyno the Adventurer when you're in Mondstadt.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 06.ogg Lisa: What do you think of Mondstadt during this time of year? It's quite nice, isn't it?
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 07.ogg Lisa: Hehe. I've always prided myself on making wise decisions, and that was certainly one of them.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 08.ogg Lisa: Well, if even you feel comfortable criticizing him now that he's retired... it really goes to show how much he's changed.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 09.ogg Lisa: Stubbornness is an all-too-common vice among scholars. I hope that never rubs off on you. I'm always happy to see you visit Mondstadt, and experience the feeling of freedom for yourself.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 10.ogg Lisa: I heard the latest news about Collei, too. No doubt the traumas of her childhood will persist for a while to come, but I have to say, she appears to be doing quite better this time than on previous visits.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 11.ogg Lisa: I suppose you're something of a mentor to her, aren't you? Now that I think about it, the two of you aren't so dissimilar. The power of Hermanubis once brought you great suffering.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 12.ogg Lisa: You are very gifted, and sometimes that can become its own curse. But he has reason to be grateful to you, too — without you as his son-slash-student, he may never have changed his stubborn ways.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 13.ogg Lisa: As a fellow student of his, I couldn't be happier for the two of you. ...Ah, look at how quickly this developed from small talk to a deep and serious conversation. That's one thing I do miss about my Akademiya days.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 14.ogg Lisa: If you say so... I suppose that means I get to call you "baby brother" from now on.
Media:vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 15.ogg Lisa: Hahaha, yes, there's the baby brother I remember.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Today's the day! Let's go meet up with Sucrose!
Media:vo eqfh102 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Sucrose, we're here!
Media:vo eqfh102 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm, so it sounds like we should put our heads together and list out the people who can help us!
Media:vo eqfh102 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Alright, then let's start from Group 1! The first riddle was... "a flower that is not of this world."
Media:vo eqfh102 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Exactly! You're the creator of the Tetratanic Sweet Flower. Who knows, maybe that's the flower we're looking for!
Media:vo eqfh102 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Oh, but what about Tighnari? He's a Forest Watcher and knows all about plants. If it's a flower we're looking for, maybe he's the man for the job!
Media:vo eqfh102 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Hmm, that's kind of abstract... Does it just mean someone who never loses their way?
Media:vo eqfh102 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Oh, you mean Mona? Yeah, she'd definitely count!
Media:vo eqfh102 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Would Bennett count?
Media:vo eqfh102 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Well, his luck's so bad that as long as you go in the opposite direction from him, you'll always be going the right way, right?
Media:vo eqfh102 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Add him to the list! Finding everyone won't take long, so one extra person won't hurt.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Yeah, she would! She's got a great sense of direction, after all. As a matter of fact, when the Traveler and Paimon first came to Mondstadt, she was actually the one who gave us directions.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Is there anyone else?
Media:vo eqfh102 1 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Cool. Another one for our list.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Oh, you wanna go see how she's doing, right? Sure, let's all go!
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Oh, Traveler, Paimon! I only just arrived myself, so I'm still getting ready.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Ah, and Collei just passed by a moment ago. She said she had some things to sort out at the inn where she's staying, but she'll meet up with us when she's done.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Apparently, Tighnari and Cyno both went out, but she stayed behind because she wanted to help us.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: Not too bad. After reviewing it again with fresh eyes, I came up with a new theory which seems to hold some water. I'll attempt to explain it as simply as I can...
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: I believe that each of the four things in the prophecy refers to a different field of knowledge. So in a way, the prophecy is a test of the reader's intelligence...
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: But it's unlikely for any one person to have expertise in all these different areas, so I suggest that we seek out one expert from each and get their opinion.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: Also, in two out of the four areas, the prophecy seems to want us to find specific people. It may even turn out that the people themselves are the answers.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: Exactly. I think we can go through each riddle in turn and generate four groups of names to match the four questions.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: Personally, I would still go with Albedo for this one. Alchemy is the most likely to have to do with otherworldly things, and he is by far the leading expert in this regard.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 10.ogg Sucrose: Huh? You really think so? Hehe...
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 11.ogg Sucrose: Alright. I'll add him to the list as well.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 12.ogg Sucrose: On to Group 2. This subject is... "a guide who will never get lost."
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 13.ogg Sucrose: Wait, but they have to be able to guide others, too, so it's not quite as simple as that...
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 14.ogg Sucrose: Mona... Yes, she certainly seems very confident, and she can use her astrology to guide people.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 15.ogg Sucrose: Hmm, I see... I—I suppose I can't argue with that logic...
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 16.ogg Sucrose: Ah, I know! Would Outrider Amber be a valid candidate for this category as well?
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 17.ogg Sucrose: Yes, she's certainly a good guide.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 18.ogg Sucrose: Let me think... Ah yes, I believe there may be one more.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 19.ogg Sucrose: Albedo once made a set of equipment for Mika from the Reconnaissance Company. He's their surveyor, and an exceptional pathfinder.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 20.ogg Sucrose: He's even instructed others in the discipline of surveying before. So in my view, he's highly unlikely to lose his way and would be very good at helping others find theirs.
Media:vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 21.ogg Sucrose: ...Wait, Collei should've been here by now. Wonder what's taking her so long? ...Sorry, could we continue our chat somewhere else?
Media:vo eqfh102 10 collei 01.ogg Collei: Welcome back! Did everything go well?
Media:vo eqfh102 10 collei 02.ogg Collei: Ah, don't worry about me! I'm used to working in the rainforest — I get splinters all the time. I've already taken care of it.
Media:vo eqfh102 10 collei 03.ogg Collei: I'll go with Sucrose to return the leftover materials to the vendors. You two, go get a proper meal — we can't have anyone going hungry!
Media:vo eqfh102 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We're back! Aw, but it looks like you two beat us.
Media:vo eqfh102 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yep, we managed to find and talk to everybody!
Media:vo eqfh102 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You're definitely your master's student, Sucrose! As long as you or Albedo are around, Paimon can relax and know that everything's taken care of.
Media:vo eqfh102 10 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wait, actually, there's one thing that still needs taking care of... Paimon's starving! Hey, Traveler, you wanna get dinner? Your treat?
Media:vo eqfh102 10 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Sounds like a plan!
Media:vo eqfh102 10 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: We got back a little early, so we took some time just now to put the mailbox together.
Media:vo eqfh102 10 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: We really got lucky today — the vendors were feeling super generous, so we didn't even need to pay for the materials! It's just a shame that Collei got a splinter...
Media:vo eqfh102 10 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: We've already wrapped up everything on our to-do list for today, so all we need to do now is wait for everyone's letters to arrive.
Media:vo eqfh102 10 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: (Traveler), Paimon, why don't you get some rest while I keep an eye on the mailbox?
Media:vo eqfh102 10 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: Ah, stop, you're embarrassing me...
Media:vo eqfh102 10 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: Yeah, now would be a good time for a break. Once everything is ready, let's meet up here again and collate all the information we've gathered.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 beatrice 01.ogg Beatrice: Is everything packed up and ready? What do you think about meeting up at five to go to my house?
Media:vo eqfh102 11 beatrice 02.ogg Beatrice: Ahem... Ham? Look, we've known each other for quite some time now. Don't you think it's been long enough for you to remember that we only eat bacon in my house?
Media:vo eqfh102 11 ellin 01.ogg Ellin: Hmm... I must remember to get some milk today on my way home...
Media:vo eqfh102 11 margaret 01.ogg Margaret: Please feel free to pay a visit to Cat's Tail any time.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Paimon will have this one... And this one, and this one...
Media:vo eqfh102 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hey, Paimon's really hungry! And don't forget, Paimon's also ordering for you, too. It's not like Paimon's gonna eat everything by herself!
Media:vo eqfh102 11 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Whew! Paimon is super full...
Media:vo eqfh102 11 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, Tone-Deaf Bard! Are you here for some food as well?
Media:vo eqfh102 11 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hmm? What kind of good news?
Media:vo eqfh102 11 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: What is it?
Media:vo eqfh102 11 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: You're starting that up again?
Media:vo eqfh102 11 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Venti always looks so relaxed whenever we run into him. Paimon can't help but be jealous...
Media:vo eqfh102 11 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Oh? Who are you?
Media:vo eqfh102 11 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: You can tell? Well, we ARE very experienced adventurers, after all!
Media:vo eqfh102 11 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Yep! Bizarre is definitely the word...
Media:vo eqfh102 11 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: What do you think about Mondstadt so far?
Media:vo eqfh102 11 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Hehe, we think so too!
Media:vo eqfh102 11 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: She definitely isn't dressed like a local, huh. Where do you think her hometown could be...?
Media:vo eqfh102 11 quinn 01.ogg Quinn: Yes, everything's ready. I've packed some great wine and smoked ham — your parents will love it.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 rosaria 01.ogg Rosaria: ...
Media:vo eqfh102 11 rosaria 02.ogg Rosaria: ...
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 01.ogg ???: Excuse me. If you don't mind... could I chat with you for a moment?
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 02.ogg Scarlett: You may call me Scarlett.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 03.ogg Scarlett: Just like you, I'm a traveler, visiting Mondstadt from another land.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 04.ogg Scarlett: Mind if I buy you a drink?
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 05.ogg Scarlett: Leaving the door open for another time, I see. I can tell that you've dealt with a lot of people during your travels.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 06.ogg Scarlett: I can. That's why I tried to strike up a conversation with you in the first place.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 07.ogg Scarlett: I was on my way to go shopping earlier when I overheard your conversation next to the Crafting Bench. From what I could gather, you are trying to investigate a bizarre prophecy?
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 08.ogg Scarlett: Don't you think it sounds just like the kind of story that would happen in Mondstadt? Anyway, that's why I wanted to ask you a favor... If and when you manage to unravel the answer to the prophecy, could you let me know what it is?
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 09.ogg Scarlett: Not so much the prophecy itself, but Mondstadt as a nation. That's what I'm interested in.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 10.ogg Scarlett: I was born in a distant land, but I have family and friends who once lived in Mondstadt for a long time. They said that it's a great place full of fairytales and romance, and recommended that I come for a visit.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 11.ogg Scarlett: As it happens, someone I know has an anniversary coming up soon, so I figured this would be a good time to come here and see all the sights that she once saw.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 12.ogg Scarlett: It certainly lives up to its name as the city of romance and freedom.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 13.ogg Scarlett: So. About the prophecy...
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 14.ogg Scarlett: Thank you. You're very friendly, it's been a real pleasure to meet you.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 15.ogg Scarlett: I'll leave you to it, then. Hope you continue to enjoy the city, and have a wonderful day.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 16.ogg Scarlett: "Please find me a flower that is not of this world, and a guide who will never get lost."
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 17.ogg Scarlett: "Find me one who would never lie, as well as a legend that never ends..."
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 18.ogg Scarlett: ...
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 19.ogg Scarlett: I never thought I'd have someone secretly following me even in a free city like Mondstadt.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 20.ogg Scarlett: Good day to you, Miss.
(Obtain Venti's Note)
Media:vo eqfh102 11 venti 01.ogg Venti: Enjoying the scenery?
Media:vo eqfh102 11 venti 02.ogg Venti: Oho, I can put something on your tab? Well, that's a pity, I already had a few drinks before coming here.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 venti 03.ogg Venti: I shall take you up on your kind offer another day! There should be no shortage of opportunities in the future.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 venti 04.ogg Venti: Anywho, you should be getting ready to thank me, I come bearing good news!
Media:vo eqfh102 11 venti 05.ogg Venti: Behold!
Media:vo eqfh102 11 venti 06.ogg Venti: It's what you need the most right now — the answer to the prophetic puzzle~
Media:vo eqfh102 11 venti 07.ogg Venti: Simply head to the location marked on the map, and you'll find the lantern you've been looking for. However...
Media:vo eqfh102 11 venti 08.ogg Venti: If I were you, I wouldn't just go and reveal the secret right away. As you've seen, a lot of people have been laboring hard to uncover the answer.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 venti 09.ogg Venti: A secret is like a well-aged brew. The aroma from the bottle is sweetest when revealed in the company of friends.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 venti 10.ogg Venti: Then it's settled. I'll leave you to your business for now. Feel free to find me for a chat again once you're done working through the prophecy!
Media:vo eqfh102 11 venti 11.ogg Venti: Hehe, also, if you have some time, we could organize another fast-track love poem class.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 venti 12.ogg Venti: I sure am! Nobody else has signed up this year though, so the duty to learn falls on you.
Media:vo eqfh102 11 venti 13.ogg Venti: Anyway, see you later!
Media:vo eqfh102 2 collei 01.ogg Collei: Ah! Sucrose! I, uh... I was preparing some... stuff...
Media:vo eqfh102 2 collei 02.ogg Collei: Is it time already? Oh no, I—I'm sorry...
Media:vo eqfh102 2 collei 03.ogg Collei: Thank you. I'm ready to join you now! Um, how's that thing going?
Media:vo eqfh102 2 collei 04.ogg Collei: Then what about Kaeya? He's the Cavalry Captain and a rather popular figure, but...
Media:vo eqfh102 2 collei 05.ogg Collei: Hmm, I can't help but agree with you there...
Media:vo eqfh102 2 collei 06.ogg Collei: In that case, I think Cyno fits in this list, too!
Media:vo eqfh102 2 collei 07.ogg Collei: But how can we help with that?
Media:vo eqfh102 2 collei 08.ogg Collei: Yeah, yeah, yeah! I had the same situation once in the Avidya Forest. I helped another Forest Ranger out by delivering a love letter to the coworker she likes...
Media:vo eqfh102 2 collei 09.ogg Collei: Sounds like a "no."
Media:vo eqfh102 2 collei 10.ogg Collei: Oh... Do I count?
Media:vo eqfh102 2 collei 11.ogg Collei: Do we have to ask absolutely everyone on the list? It seems like a lot of people...
Media:vo eqfh102 2 collei 12.ogg Collei: ...Okay, I promise I'll help! Capable Collei... yeah, I got this!
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Next up is the third line: "one who would never lie"... Hmm, anyone spring to mind?
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uhh... you really think so? Seems like it would be pretty difficult for someone in his position to avoid having to lie.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You think there's something fishy about him too, huh? Yeah... he's definitely a sneaky one! Bet he lies all the time.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: There's the Tone-Deaf Bard... Uh, but on second thought, he wouldn't qualify either. He talks way too much nonsense. Hmm... is there anyone else we're missing?
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hmm, white lies are still lies... But do we really have to reject her because of some harmless fibs? It's not like she had evil intentions.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: No, we're the ones being strict!
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Rosaria doesn't look like the sort of person you'd want to get into a fight with... Maybe she just fights her way out of situations that some people might lie to get out of?
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: She's a tough cookie, huh. Let's put her name down.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Ah, true. Lying's probably more trouble than it's worth for someone like him — kinda like with Rosaria.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Oh, and Paimon also nominates Razor! Bet he couldn't lie to save his life.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Alrighty, write her name down too!
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Huh? You mean... Timaeus?
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Timaeus has a crush!?
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Well, who is it? Do you know her?
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Is it any good?
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Hmph, alright, guess we'll put lover boy down on the list then.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Lisa, perhaps? A librarian understands books best... and aren't most legends written down somewhere?
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Maybe Collei! She read a lot of fairy tales when Tighnari was teaching her to read.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: Point taken... Paimon didn't quite understand any of those...
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: Alright then, Klee makes the shortlist!
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 21.ogg Paimon: Okie-dokie!
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 22.ogg Paimon: No problem, we can do that.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 23.ogg Paimon: Capable Collei and Sensible Sucrose... sounds like a winning combination!
Media:vo eqfh102 2 paimon 24.ogg Paimon: Rest assured that the unbeatable (Traveler) and Paimon will do our part too! Off we go!
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Hi Collei, hope we're not intruding or anything... Is everything okay?
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Don't worry, the Traveler and I only just met up. We were just worried that you might get lost along the way, so we thought that we'd come get you.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: So let's pick up where we left off.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: Acting Grand Master Jean? She has a good name in that regard... but from what I know, she sometimes covers up the truth out of concern for those around her...
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: For example, when Lisa loses track of time in the library and misses her patrol shift, Jean'll come up with some excuse, like "Lisa's ill today."
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: Also, she sometimes makes up stories to get Klee to behave. Like the one about the big monster that comes to catch naughty kids who don't go to bed on time... D'you think that rules her out?
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: Rosaria doesn't strike me as the type of person to lie.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: Ah Collei, you probably haven't met her yet, have you? She's a sister from the church who looks, um... a little scary and not very sociable.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: She stopped by the alchemy bench once, a long time ago, and asked me about Albedo.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 10.ogg Sucrose: I thought maybe she was trying to find him, for work or something. But when I asked, she just said that she was curious about him because he was so intelligent, and wanted to talk to his assistant to find out what he was like.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 11.ogg Sucrose: A lot of people might have given a more tactful justification, but I could see in her face that she wasn't trying to hide anything. She was just very direct and straightforward.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 12.ogg Sucrose: That's why I don't think of her as the lying type.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 13.ogg Sucrose: I can definitely see that! I've also heard the other sisters say that Rosaria doesn't even make excuses when she skips choir — she just doesn't show up.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 14.ogg Sucrose: I've also got someone else in mind, Noelle, the trainee knight! She's a very honest person. I don't think she'd tell a lie.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 15.ogg Sucrose: ...Wait, there's one more person... You know, our long-standing staffer at the alchemy bench...
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 16.ogg Sucrose: Yes, him. Um, truth be told, he's been lovestruck recently.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 17.ogg Sucrose: He swore that he wouldn't say a dishonest word or slack off until he succeeds in getting the woman he loves.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 18.ogg Sucrose: Yes, that's right.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 19.ogg Sucrose: I've never met her. All I know is that she's from Liyue... Timaeus says that she's fun, has a great personality, and is very, very good-looking.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 20.ogg Sucrose: Since we're on the topic — helping Timaeus win the lady of his dreams was also one of my goals for this Windblume Festival!
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 21.ogg Sucrose: I dunno, make sure he uses nice paper and a fancy envelope when he sends letters to her, help him pick a nice gift and wrap it properly... That sort of thing.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 22.ogg Sucrose: Yep, that sort of thing, exactly! Oh, also, I helped him with some of the groundwork for one of his research projects. He must have appreciated it, because he gave me a refrigeration device that he's been developing as a thank-you gift.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 23.ogg Sucrose: Uh... I mean, it looks nice...
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 24.ogg Sucrose: Okay, so last of all, we have "a legend that never ends." Anyone come to mind for this particular line?
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 25.ogg Sucrose: When I think about "legends," fairy tales and picture books come to mind.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 26.ogg Sucrose: Of course you do. I'll put you on the list.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 27.ogg Sucrose: I prefer to read things like "An Illustrated Analysis of Alchemical Substances and Their Uses," "The Fascinating Principles of Crafting," and "Hypotheses of Life"...
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 28.ogg Sucrose: Hmmm. Klee might be a good choice. Her mother, Alice, is a renowned traveling author, so I'll bet she's been exposed to all sorts of myths and legends.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 29.ogg Sucrose: Well, that should just about do it. Next up, we should go and ask the people on the list about the prophecy.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 30.ogg Sucrose: It is, so I was thinking that perhaps we should split up? That might make our search more effective.
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 31.ogg Sucrose: Also, I've thought of a method of gathering feedback...
Media:vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 32.ogg Sucrose: You and (Traveler) are practically joined at the hip, so you two can go together. I'll pair up with Collei.
Media:vo eqfh102 3 collei 01.ogg Collei: "Stronghold," That's an, uh... interesting word to use.
Media:vo eqfh102 3 collei 02.ogg Collei: How about... "lair"?
Media:vo eqfh102 3 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: I plan on starting from the person with the most defined stronghold, so let's go to the library. Lisa should be there.
Media:vo eqfh102 3 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Umm... maybe "den"? No, that's even worse...
Media:vo eqfh102 4 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Sucrose? Collei? What are you doing here?
Media:vo eqfh102 4 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Surprising, isn't it? She went out. I'm afraid it's just us here looking for information.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Oh? What sort of prophecy?
Media:vo eqfh102 4 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: Understood. Once we've had a look into it, we'll place our replies into your mailbox.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: Traveling and meeting old friends are both good for the body and soul.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: And isn't rediscovering one's youth while revisiting old haunts a worthwhile pursuit?
Media:vo eqfh102 4 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: So might I assume that your respective claims of looking for plants and artists in Mondstadt were just pretexts?
Media:vo eqfh102 4 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: Well, it won't hurt to give her some more time. I believe that Sucrose might be able to help her.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: You could say that. In a similar vein... I've heard that Sumeru's scholars often build their social relationships based on their academic ones. Is that true?
Media:vo eqfh102 4 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: Oh, so the academic paper is the nexus of the academic family? Interesting.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: I can understand that position. I have a younger sister myself, and it's only natural for me to be protective of her.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: What you described fits the idea of a city of learning as I imagine it. The family is where all social relationships intersect... as such, a family founded on common goals may actually be more stable.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 albedo 13.ogg Albedo: By the way, who's the eldest between you?
Media:vo eqfh102 4 collei 01.ogg Collei: (Oh no, that was a bad word choice. Now Sucrose is using it and it's all my fault...)
Media:vo eqfh102 4 collei 02.ogg Collei: Um, is Lisa not here at the moment?
Media:vo eqfh102 4 collei 03.ogg Collei: But there's no rush! You don't need to answer right away! We're just here to tell you about the situation. You can take your time to think it over, and submit any thoughts you have in written form to the Sucrose Mailbox.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 collei 04.ogg Collei: Haha, I think in this case, we CAN just go with your quick answer off the top of your head...
Media:vo eqfh102 4 collei 05.ogg Collei: Thank you all so much. Okay, let's tick them off the list, and carry on working our way down...
Media:vo eqfh102 4 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: I can only "Sucrose" that they were "Collei"-ng in on someone. At "Lisa," that's as far as "Cyno."
Media:vo eqfh102 4 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: Except me. I'm not here for information. Like you, I came here on an abortive search for the librarian, who is also my Akademiya senior.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: That's right. Her mentor in Sumeru was also my benefactor. We were both Spantamad students.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: I see... You want to ask them about the "flower that is not of this world," and me about the "one who would never lie."
Media:vo eqfh102 4 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: The Sucrose Mailbox?
Media:vo eqfh102 4 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: Agreed. Certainly when it comes to discerning whether someone is a liar or not, you cannot simply take them at their word.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: Do you get the feeling that Collei's return to Mondstadt has emboldened her more contrarian side?
Media:vo eqfh102 4 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: ...When I first met Collei, she'd never known happiness or youth.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: But things are different now. Her Eleazar being cured was a huge milestone in her life.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: I wouldn't say that. Both Collei and Genius Invokation TCG are very important to me.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: Fine. Yes, we came out of concern for Collei. She's been back to Mondstadt of her own accord several times, but it has led to no significant improvement in her mood.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: I would think of us more as siblings. An equal and pure relationship, unaffected by academic considerations.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 cyno 13.ogg Cyno: In terms of age, I'm the eldest, of course. He just doesn't want to admit it.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 cyno 14.ogg Cyno: No... You will never see me admit to being the youngest sibling! Except perhaps as a last-ditch effort to turn the tables in a game of cards.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Here we are! Lisa's lair!
Media:vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Lisa, might I ask if... Huh?
Media:vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Oh, so you studied in the same Darshan as Lisa?
Media:vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: Wow, that's cool... But wait, we're getting sidetracked! We came here to look for some information — Collei and I are investigating a prophecy, and we were hoping you all might be able to help.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: Yep. I was thinking about it on the way, and although these seem like trick questions, there's a lot to mull over once you get down to the details. A quick answer off the top of your head might not go into enough depth.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: So, I decided to place a mailbox next to the alchemy crafting table. Everyone can submit their written answers there when they're ready.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: We don't have to call it the Sucrose Mailbox, though. It could just as well be called the Sucrose and Collei Mailbox, or even the Sucrose, Collei, Traveler, and Paimon Mailbox...
Media:vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: Mm-hmm. Already done.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Please... Just stop it with these puns, I beg you. Are you trying to win worldwide fame for unfunny jokes?
Media:vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Sounds like a good solution. Certainly more reliable than verbal discussion alone.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: I'm pleasantly surprised to see those two introverts getting along so well.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Yes, I'd noticed that too.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: Collei is a very sensitive and introverted child. I'm sure you must have noticed that too, Albedo.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: From the time she's been in my care, I've observed that she's actually a very lively character by nature... but she had a very rough start in life, and it changed her.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: Would it really kill you to just say "yes" in this situation?
Media:vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Sounds like an extension of your own self-confidence as her teacher.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: I suppose it might look like that from your perspective. Sumeru's society is something of a special case — the reason it is known as the city of learning is because all of its resources are in some way linked to academia.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: As such, academic resources equate to social capital. It is not unheard of, for example, for people to build a family in order to pursue further studies.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: But the relationship between the three of us is not an academic one turned social. We've never even worked on a paper together, for starters.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 12.ogg Tighnari: As much as I'd prefer not to admit it, that statement is not inaccurate.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 13.ogg Tighnari: Let's not go down this rabbit hole, please.
Media:vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 14.ogg Tighnari: But your mental age is younger than that. I daresay even by enough to be the youngest sibling. Perhaps I could bring Collei into this happy family to be your elder sister?
Media:vo eqfh102 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Guess we'll leave Collei and Sucrose to it. Fingers crossed all goes well for them! Now then, where should we go first?
Media:vo eqfh102 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's try our luck at the bulletin board, shall we?
Media:vo eqfh102 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: A lot of people tend to show up there at some point in the day — maybe we'll get lucky!
Media:vo eqfh102 6 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Hey there, (Traveler) and Paimon! It's been a while. How've you been?
Media:vo eqfh102 6 bennett 02a.ogg Bennett: No need to be so formal! We've known them for ages, they're cool!
Media:vo eqfh102 6 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: A prophecy? What kind?
Media:vo eqfh102 6 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: I can't believe I made it onto your list of names... You really think I'll be able to help?
Media:vo eqfh102 6 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: Okay, then in that case, I'll step up and present my thoughts on the matter! ...Uh, except I forgot I'm not really good at organizing my thoughts... Oops...
Media:vo eqfh102 6 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: You still have other people on your list that you need to go see, right? We should leave you to it! Don't worry about us, we'll drop off our letters at the mailbox as soon as we're done.
Media:vo eqfh102 6 lisa 01.ogg Lisa: You look surprised, cuties. Is it because of me?
Media:vo eqfh102 6 lisa 02.ogg Lisa: Oh please, it's not as if I'm glued to my chair. I like to get out for a little fresh air every once in a while.
Media:vo eqfh102 6 lisa 03.ogg Lisa: Mika's here today, so I thought it'd be a good time to introduce him to Bennett and Razor. They're all out and about quite often, so it's helpful for them to get to know one another.
Media:vo eqfh102 6 lisa 04.ogg Lisa: Gosh, that all sounds quite fascinating.
Media:vo eqfh102 6 lisa 05.ogg Lisa: A meticulous and efficient plan. Yep, that sounds like Sucrose.
Media:vo eqfh102 6 lisa 06.ogg Lisa: Aw, you're working so hard. Do be sure to get some rest when you can. If you get tired, you know you're always welcome to visit me for a break and a cup of tea.
Media:vo eqfh102 6 mika 01.ogg Mika: Hello, everyone. My name is Mika.
Media:vo eqfh102 6 mika 02.ogg Mika: I—I look forward to working with you...
Media:vo eqfh102 6 mika 03.ogg Mika: A good one, or a bad one?
Media:vo eqfh102 6 mika 04.ogg Mika: Right, believe in yourself! You're a first-rate adventurer, Bennett.
Media:vo eqfh102 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Nice! Just as we hoped, there's a load of people here!
Media:vo eqfh102 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? Even Lisa's here?
Media:vo eqfh102 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We've been doing pretty well!
Media:vo eqfh102 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Actually, we haven't gotten to the fun part yet! We've been busy investigating a prophecy.
Media:vo eqfh102 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: There's no need to tell us all of your thoughts right here and now! Sucrose said she'll put a mailbox next to the crafting bench, so you can just write down your thoughts when they come to you, and drop them there.
Media:vo eqfh102 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Okay! Bye for now!
Media:vo eqfh102 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Let's head over to Starsnatch Cliff next! Maybe we'll be able to find some people there.
Media:vo eqfh102 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: And even if we don't find any familiar faces... You can see really far from up at the top. Maybe we can find people that way!
Media:vo eqfh102 6 razor 01.ogg Razor: Teacher is... not at the usual place.
Media:vo eqfh102 6 razor 02.ogg Razor: Windblume... fun?
Media:vo eqfh102 6 razor 03.ogg Razor: Believe... in yourself!
Media:vo eqfh102 6 razor 04.ogg Razor: I will think also. Give me some time.
Media:vo eqfh102 7 collei 01.ogg Collei: Where to next...? Let me check my notes... Ah, this way!
Media:vo eqfh102 7 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Got it! Collei, please follow me.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Collei, we were just talking about you! Ah, right, I don't think you've been introduced to Noelle before. Collei, this is Noelle, maid of the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 ambor 02.ogg Amber: Yep! A few folks from Sumeru have come to visit, so we're brainstorming a few nice surprises for them...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 ambor 03.ogg Amber: Ah! Sorry, I... uhh...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 ambor 04.ogg Amber: Hehehe, at least I didn't say anything about what the surprises are...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 ambor 05.ogg Amber: Yep, don't worry, you can count on us! But we do have to finish our patrol first.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 ambor 06.ogg Amber: We started in the Stormbearer Mountains, and we'll end at the city gates. You'd be very welcome to join us, but it sounds like you're pretty busy with all this.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 ambor 07.ogg Amber: ...Aw, look! They're enjoying the scenery together!
Media:vo eqfh102 8 ambor 08.ogg Amber: We're not what Collei needs right now. She needs a new friend — someone different, who's never met her before.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 ambor 09.ogg Amber: There is! You'll understand once you're a little older, Klee. People can draw different kinds of strength from different kinds of friends, and right now, Collei needs someone that's just not the same ol' me!
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 01.ogg Collei: Amber!? Wow, and Eula's with her too...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 02.ogg Collei: Oh! Uh... N—Nice to meet you too, Noelle! My name is Collei... but you already knew that.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 03.ogg Collei: I'd heard that there was a very young knight in the ranks, but it's still a surprise to see with my own eyes...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 04.ogg Collei: I'm a Trainee Forest Ranger in the Avidya Forest.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 05.ogg Collei: It means I'm not officially a fully qualified Forest Watcher yet. I'm still learning.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 06.ogg Collei: (Whew... Don't panic, Collei, just pick a topic and join the conversation! Don't panic, whatever you do, don't panic... It's just Amber and her friends. There's no need to be nervous...)
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 07.ogg Collei: (Oh nooo, how am I supposed to join this conversation now? What do I say to that...)
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 08.ogg Collei: (Ahh, I'm saved, Sucrose has given me a lead-in. Now, I just need to follow on from what she's already started talking about...)
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 09.ogg Collei: Thank you so much, Eula.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 10.ogg Collei: Oh... yeah, so, um... We'll be on our way for now! Hehe...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 11.ogg Collei: Uhh... was it that obvious?
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 12.ogg Collei: Ugh, so that means it was obvious... *sigh*
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 13.ogg Collei: ...Thanks, Sucrose.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 14.ogg Collei: Well... the truth is, I don't really know how to act around Amber and the others.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 15.ogg Collei: We are... Amber's a really important friend to me...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 16.ogg Collei: ...I don't know. I guess, if I'm being completely honest, the problem's probably with me...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 17.ogg Collei: The first time I came to Mondstadt, I was really immature. I didn't wanna let people in, and I was generally pretty awful to everyone... Amber was the one person who didn't give up on me. If it wasn't for her persistence, I wouldn't have found a friend at all.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 18.ogg Collei: Without Amber, I might not even be here today. And because of that, I really look up to her. I think of her as my role model, and hoped that maybe one day, I could learn to be like her...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 19.ogg Collei: ...But after trying and failing for several years, I think I've finally realized... I'm no Amber, and I never will be.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 20.ogg Collei: Looking back, it seems silly that I ever thought like that. We're nothing alike at all... My personality's so... weird. I always get so anxious and I overthink everything...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 21.ogg Collei: ...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 22.ogg Collei: Um, Sucrose, would it be okay if I... told you a bit about my past?
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 23.ogg Collei: I'm sorry, we've only just met and I'm already dumping all of this on you... This is why I get so frustrated at myself. I'm always doing this... I get into a spiral of self-doubt, and then I end up having to find somewhere to vent it all out...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 24.ogg Collei: ...R—Really?
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 25.ogg Collei: Oh...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 26.ogg Collei: (Sucrose has stopped talking, but for some reason, this doesn't feel awkward at all. Maybe she's right, and we're more similar than I realized.)
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 27.ogg Collei: (In Sumeru, I always like to find a quiet place to just sit and watch the scenery, but it's always by myself. I never thought there'd be a day when I could do this with someone else by my side...)
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 28.ogg Collei: (...Mondstadt's breeze is so gentle and soft.)
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 29.ogg Collei: Um... uh... I don't think so... Sorry...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 30.ogg Collei: ...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 31.ogg Collei: Thank you, Sucrose. I feel much better after talking to you...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 32.ogg Collei: Your Tetra-what??
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 33.ogg Collei: O—Oh, okay! Yeah, you'll definitely have to show them to me sometime!
Media:vo eqfh102 8 collei 34.ogg Collei: Sure! Hmm... I'll try the cheese one!
Media:vo eqfh102 8 eula 01.ogg Eula: Relax, you two. There's no need to be so courteous — we're not on some kind of diplomatic mission here.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 eula 02.ogg Eula: Technically, though the distinction is hardly relevant right now. This isn't a very formal patrol... we're just chatting.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 eula 03.ogg Eula: Amber!
Media:vo eqfh102 8 eula 04.ogg Eula: So essentially, you're gathering information to help you solve the riddles, correct? I'll do my best to help.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 eula 05.ogg Eula: Any time.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 eula 06.ogg Eula: Nice idea, I think we can all commit to writing a note. We'll see what we can come up with.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 eula 07.ogg Eula: No, it's fine. Let them sit for a while.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 klee 01.ogg Klee: Hmm? Oh, it's Sucrose! And Klee also spies... the girl with the long scarf!
Media:vo eqfh102 8 klee 02.ogg Klee: Nope! Klee's on patrol with the other knights.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 klee 03.ogg Klee: Collei, what do you do?
Media:vo eqfh102 8 klee 04.ogg Klee: Trainee...?
Media:vo eqfh102 8 klee 05.ogg Klee: What kind of surprise? Tell me! Tell me!
Media:vo eqfh102 8 klee 06.ogg Klee: I'll drop something in there for sure!
Media:vo eqfh102 8 klee 07.ogg Klee: Shall we go play with them?
Media:vo eqfh102 8 klee 08.ogg Klee: I don't get it... Is there a difference?
Media:vo eqfh102 8 noelle 01.ogg Noelle: Nice to meet you, Collei. I missed you the last few times you were in Mondstadt, so I'm glad to finally meet you in person.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 noelle 02.ogg Noelle: Oh, you're just like me! I'm still working towards becoming a fully qualified knight.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 noelle 03.ogg Noelle: Hmm. What an interesting prophecy... I have no idea what the answers could be, though.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 noelle 04.ogg Noelle: See you later! Have a safe trip back.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Oh, it's our lucky day! There are several people over there.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Klee, what are you doing here? Are you planning to blast some fish?
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Huh, now that you mention it, it looks like everyone here's a Knight of Favonius except for Collei and me...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: Let me guess... were you chatting about the new guests in town?
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: Speaking of nice surprises... we've actually had a fairly big one recently.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: There's no need to answer right away. We'll put a mailbox next to the Crafting Bench for people to drop us a note once they've thought of something.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: What route are you taking today?
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: ...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: No — there's always next time. We'll join up with you after we're done working through this prophecy.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 10.ogg Sucrose: Are you okay, Collei?
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 11.ogg Sucrose: No, no, not at all. It just looked like you had something on your mind.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 12.ogg Sucrose: Whatever's bothering you, you can talk to me about it if you want. I'm happy to help.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 13.ogg Sucrose: Really? I thought you two were good friends.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 14.ogg Sucrose: Aw, Collei... don't say that.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 15.ogg Sucrose: ...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 16.ogg Sucrose: (I already knew bits and pieces about her, but still... Why did she have to go through all that?)
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 17.ogg Sucrose: No no no, it's fine! I—I'm really glad that you're willing to tell me all this.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 18.ogg Sucrose: People don't open up about their deepest feelings unless they really trust the other person. Don't you think? At least... I think it's kind of an honor.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 19.ogg Sucrose: And I mean... Umm... You've probably noticed by now, but I don't have the best social skills either. I always just end up talking about the things I'm interested in, and going on and on...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 20.ogg Sucrose: But even so, you still listen to me when I talk my head off about alchemy. It's a relief to listen to you talking about yourself for once.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 21.ogg Sucrose: If you hadn't told me all of those things, I never would have guessed that you struggle so much. Honestly, I feel like we're very similar people.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 22.ogg Sucrose: Yeah! Everyone has their own problems to deal with... I certainly do!
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 23.ogg Sucrose: All the feelings that you talked about just now... I totally get it. It takes so much more effort for us introverts to fit into a crowd.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 24.ogg Sucrose: When you were saying about how you try to think about what to say in advance, and you're constantly terrified of saying the wrong thing and making things awkward... I relate to that so much! Oh, and also that part about studying under a genius...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 25.ogg Sucrose: In fact, before meeting you, I'd never met anyone who seemed so similar to myself.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 26.ogg Sucrose: Um... I'm not very good at giving words of comfort or anything, and I'm not gonna tell you to just get over it or stop worrying about it. How about we just sit here for a little while? We don't have to force a conversation if we can't think of anything. We can just... sit here together.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 27.ogg Sucrose: Hey, Collei... see that cloud over there? Doesn't it look like... one of my test tubes?
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 28.ogg Sucrose: Hehe, then maybe we're not quite on the same wavelength on everything... at least, not when it comes to looking at clouds in the sky.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 29.ogg Sucrose: Yeah, it helps a lot, doesn't it? I also vent to my flasks sometimes. The next time we get the chance, I have to show you my Tetratanic Sweet Flower and my Tetratanic Windblume...
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 30.ogg Sucrose: Two of my favorite things I've made. They're really cool. I think you might like them.
Media:vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 31.ogg Sucrose: I brought some crackers with me, you want one? There's cheese flavor or tomato flavor.
Media:vo eqfh102 9 mona 01.ogg Mona: Good question. What kind of a motley crew is this?
Media:vo eqfh102 9 mona 02.ogg Mona: You two are looking pretty good. I trust you've been well?
Media:vo eqfh102 9 mona 03.ogg Mona: You're one to talk! If this sister hadn't grabbed you in time, then you'd have been seriously hurt, if not dead!
Media:vo eqfh102 9 mona 04.ogg Mona: Quite literally. And had she not lent him a hand and pulled him up, he would've gone tumbling down the cliffside...
Media:vo eqfh102 9 mona 05.ogg Mona: *sigh* I hardly think giving flowers to your crush is worth throwing one's life away for...
Media:vo eqfh102 9 mona 06.ogg Mona: ...So that's why the scryglass just showed "danger" instead of "fatal danger."
Media:vo eqfh102 9 mona 07.ogg Mona: No, no, no one asked. Please do not subject us to your gushing about your girlfriend.
Media:vo eqfh102 9 mona 08.ogg Mona: You said you need clues, right? In that case, Mona Megistus the Astrologist will provide you with a personally handwritten letter. Just wait for it to show up in your mailbox!
Media:vo eqfh102 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Starsnatch Cliff, we made it! Paimon hopes we find someone we need here...
Media:vo eqfh102 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Who's that yelling? Let's hurry and take a look!
Media:vo eqfh102 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Timaeus!? And we also have... Rosaria and Mona!? What kind of mishmash ensemble is this...
Media:vo eqfh102 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Yep... we're definitely faring a lot better than this poor guy on the ground...
Media:vo eqfh102 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: What happened? Did Timaeus almost fall off the cliff?
Media:vo eqfh102 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: But you still came up here anyway...?
Media:vo eqfh102 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Okay... That explains you, but why is Rosaria here?
Media:vo eqfh102 9 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Just trying our luck! We've got a lot of people we need to see today, so we've been all over the place. Actually, you're some of the people we were looking for!
Media:vo eqfh102 9 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Alright, then let's head back for now and meet up with everyone else!
Media:vo eqfh102 9 rosaria 01.ogg ???: Tsk.
Media:vo eqfh102 9 rosaria 02.ogg Rosaria: It's been a while, Traveler.
Media:vo eqfh102 9 rosaria 03.ogg Rosaria: Don't mention it. Just lending a hand.
Media:vo eqfh102 9 rosaria 04.ogg Rosaria: It's rare to run into someone with a death wish in this area.
Media:vo eqfh102 9 rosaria 05.ogg Rosaria: I was looking for a quiet place to escape the crowds. I wasn't planning on having to save a life along the way.
Media:vo eqfh102 9 rosaria 06.ogg Rosaria: I see. So all we'll need to do is to find some clues, make a note, and drop it off at the mailbox?
Media:vo eqfh102 9 rosaria 07.ogg Rosaria: You can be on your way, now. We won't keep you any longer.
Media:vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 01.ogg ???: Heeeelp! I beg you, please don't let go!
Media:vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 02.ogg Timaeus: Hey, please don't rub salt in my wound! I really have been trying my best!
Media:vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 03.ogg Timaeus: I know, I know... I really am grateful, Miss! I can't thank you enough...
Media:vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 04.ogg Timaeus: Uh, well... So what actually happened was... I came to Starsnatch Cliff today to pick some flowers, and ran into Mona on the way. She took a look at her scryglass, and advised me to turn back, because it would be dangerous...
Media:vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 05.ogg Timaeus: ...Yes, I did, because there's something I just had to do!
Media:vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 06.ogg Timaeus: I don't have a death wish! I just... didn't think it would really come true... I mean, when Mona said "it would be dangerous," I thought I'd be fine as long as I watched my step cautiously. I'm sorry, okay? I was wrong.
Media:vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 07.ogg Timaeus: I'm telling you, I'm just here chasing the love of my life. Lovestruck Mondstadters is what the Windblume Festival's all about!
Media:vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 08.ogg Timaeus: Ahaha, very funny... Anyway, (Traveler) and Paimon, what brings the two of you to Starsnatch Cliff?
Media:vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 09.ogg Timaeus: Huh?
Media:vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 10.ogg Timaeus: I can't believe there's a prophecy like this... Let alone that I have a part to play in it!
Media:vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 11.ogg Timaeus: I guess this means everyone will find out about my crush now... Hehe...
Media:vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 12.ogg Timaeus: I came here because I wanted to give some Cecilias to the girl I love. They'll really suit her. She's—
Media:vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 13.ogg Timaeus: Oh... You saw right through me...
Media:vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 14.ogg Timaeus: Will do! Ugh, this is all so embarrassing... Thank you both!
