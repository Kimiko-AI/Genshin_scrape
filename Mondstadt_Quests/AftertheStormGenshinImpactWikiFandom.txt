 I have it right here.
 I have other things to do...
Wagner: That's no issue. We aren't in a rush. When I have time, I'll check it out myself.
(Cancel quest)
 I'm on the case.
Wagner: My thanks. These crystal ores should help in forging and in restoring the city as well...
 Quest DescriptionAfter Dvalin was cleansed, access to Stormterror's Lair has been restored. Wagner would like to go there to look for precious Crystal Ore...
 So, about the ores...
 What is it?
Paimon: So there are crystals here! Wagner will be pleased.
Paimon: There's a ton of crystal here... Let's mine some and take them back to Wagner.
Paimon: There's some over here too. Wowee, there's so many of them!
Wagner: ...But with so many places in the city needing repairs, our smithy's services are in high demand. Schulz can't hold the fort down alone either, so I can't leave.
Wagner: Have you heard of Stormterror's Lair? It's those ruins outside Mondstadt.
Wagner: Here's your payment. Take it for your trouble.
Wagner: I've heard people say that the storm around the area has disappeared. That should have been a prime moment to go for the ore veins...
Wagner: Let me see. Huh. These crystal ores actually don't look half bad.
Wagner: My thanks. These crystal ores should help in forging and in restoring the city as well...
Wagner: So, did you manage to mine any ore?
Wagner: So, this means that the storm around Stormterror's Lair has indeed dispersed. I should make time to go there myself soon...
Wagner: That's no issue. We aren't in a rush. When I have time, I'll check it out myself.
Wagner: There's still much work to be done. I need to put my back into it...
Wagner: Traveler, do you have a moment?
Wagner: What say you go have a look, Traveler? If you find any crystal ore, bring some back with you.
Wagner: While Stormterror made the place his home, it was shrouded in a whirling, impassable storm. No one could pass through, so the precious crystal ore in there hasn't been mined.
