 ...I can't smell anything.
 It's the smell of burnt Pyro Slimes.
 No doubt nothing more than a disorderly mob of creatures.
Media:vo mdaq029 2 kaeya 06b.ogg Kaeya: Oh, ho-ho! You're quite the brave one, aren't you!
 Not worth complimenting really...
 Quest DescriptionKaeya will accompany you to explore the Temple of the Wolf.
 Thanks, that's nice of you to say...
 Will it be dangerous?
Media:vo mdaq029 2 kaeya 06a.ogg Kaeya: As bustling as it may be — no, I can't imagine it will be dangerous at all.
Cutscene's Travel Log summary:
After finishing some "clean up" with Kaeya, he stays behind by himself to take care of the aftermath — that is to say, taking care of the Abyss Mage pulling strings behind the scenes. As the two confront one another, an unfamiliar red-headed man appears and disposes of the Abyss Mage with ease. Looks like another player has entered the fray...
Media:vo dialog mdaq029 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: My first chance to fight beside you.
Media:vo dialog mdaq029 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Think we'll make a good team?
Media:vo mdaq029 2 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: You've arrived.
Media:vo mdaq029 2 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Come closer. Can you smell that?
Media:vo mdaq029 2 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Something must have happened in the temple.
Media:vo mdaq029 2 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: I imagine there will be slimes, hilichurls, and... whatever is giving Stormterror extra power.
Media:vo mdaq029 2 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Oh yes, it is going to be lively in there indeed!
Media:vo mdaq029 2 kaeya 06a.ogg Kaeya: As bustling as it may be — no, I can't imagine it will be dangerous at all.
Media:vo mdaq029 2 kaeya 06b.ogg Kaeya: Oh, ho-ho! You're quite the brave one, aren't you!
Media:vo mdaq029 2 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: It's a pity that the Temple of the Wolf has been disturbed by such an atrocity.
Media:vo mdaq029 2 kaeya 08a.ogg Kaeya: Let's head in, (Traveler).
Media:vo mdaq029 2 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: No one makes offerings to The Four Winds anymore, yet the old winds never vanish...
Media:vo mdaq029 2 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: We need to clear out the temples, for The Four Winds.
Media:vo mdaq030 4 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Let me show you how the Knights of Favonius conquer our adversaries!
(Kaeya joins you as a trial character in the domain)
Media:vo mdaq030 5 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Hmm. If I'm not mistaken, the end of the temple should be up there.
Media:vo mdaq030 5 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Heh, experience.
Media:vo mdaq030 5 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: ...The kind of experience you get after years of dealing with things like this for others.
Media:vo mdaq030 5 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Seems the path ends here. Let's use the wind currents to fly up.
Media:vo mdaq030 5 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Traveler... Unless I'm mistaken, you don't seem to have a Vision.
Media:vo mdaq030 5 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: So how exactly is it that you're able to channel elemental energy?
Media:vo mdaq030 5 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Good idea. That's some keen observation.
Media:vo mdaq030 5 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: We should get Jean to give you a title and make you a knight.
Media:vo mdaq030 5 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Speaking of, did you know?
Media:vo mdaq030 5 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: Stormterror was once one of The Four Winds.
Media:vo mdaq030 5 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: I'm not aware of the exact details. If you're interested, you can ask the Acting Grand Master about it.
Media:vo mdaq030 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wait... How do you know?
Media:vo mdaq030 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ugh, finally... we're here.
Media:vo mdaq030 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: It was a very strange occurrence.
Media:vo mdaq030 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Water! We can use this to put out fire!
Media:vo mdaq031 6 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Seems probable. Let's deal with it.
Media:vo mdaq031 6 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Bravo! What a performance!
Media:vo mdaq031 6 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: You are, to my surprise, a well-trained knight.
Media:vo mdaq031 6 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: The battles you just fought were sights to behold.
Media:vo mdaq031 6 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Haha, I see you already have the knightly virtue of modesty.
Media:vo mdaq031 6 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Stories of your heroic deeds to save Mondstadt from destruction shall be known throughout the City of Freedom, well into the future.
Media:vo mdaq031 6 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Please do visit me at our headquarters when you have the time.
Media:vo mdaq031 6 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: I also know a lovely tavern, if that's more your thing.
Media:vo mdaq031 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Is that the thing that Stormterror is using to gain its power?
Media:vo mdaq031 7 cs abyss 02.ogg Hydro Abyss Mage: Gohus, Chiso Vonph.
(A red-headed man defeats the Abyss Mage)
Media:vo mdaq031 7 cs diluc 01.ogg ???: Knights of Favonius... Always so inefficient.
Media:vo mdaq031 7 cs kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Quite rewarding, no?
Media:vo mdaq031 7 cs kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: I can take care of the rest here. You go take care of other things while I'm at it.
Media:vo mdaq031 7 cs kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: There's no way hilichurls organized an ambush like this themselves — not with their limited mental capacity...
(A Hydro Abyss Mage reveals itself)
Media:vo mdaq031 7 cs kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Thus YOU were behind this.
Media:vo mdaq031 7 cs kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Agree to disagree. But, your involvement in this just made things a whole lot more interesting.
Media:vo mdaq031 7 cs paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We've seized another temple from Stormterror's grasp!
Media:vo mdaq031 7 cs paimon 02.ogg Paimon: See you later then, bye-bye~!
(The Traveler and Paimon leave)
Media:vo mdaq035 3b paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Phew, it's finally done.
Media:vo mdaq035 3b paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Well, all that "ley flow" and "elemental lines" stuff Lisa was going on about should hopefully be back to normal.
Media:vo mdaq035 3b paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wanna go back and see how the Knights are doing?
Media:vo mdaq035 3b paimon 04.ogg Paimon: But if you got anything more interesting to do, Paimon can come too!
Media:vo mdaq035 3b paimon 05.ogg Paimon: By the way, we obtained another Anemoculus in one of The Four Winds' temples, right?
Media:vo mdaq035 3b paimon 06.ogg Paimon: We might come across more of them in the future, so don't forget to offer them to the Statues!
