 Amber, something has come up...
Media:vo rzlq002 1 paimon 02a.ogg Paimon: Amber, do you know a wolf boy from Wolvendom?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01a.ogg Amber: Who?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 paimon 02a 1.ogg Paimon: He said you guys hit it off like a mountain on fire...
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01a 1.ogg Amber: What on earth are you talking about?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 paimon 02a 2.ogg Paimon: Strange... He said he would wait for you at your regular spot. Did you lose your memory or something?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01a 2.ogg Amber: My memory is fine. But you've been eating magic matsutake again, haven't you Paimon?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01a 3.ogg Amber: I have no idea what you're talking about.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 paimon 02a 3.ogg Paimon: Magic matsutake... Remind me what color they are?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01a 4.ogg Amber: Purple.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 paimon 02a 4.ogg Paimon: ...Paimon may have had a couple the other day.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 paimon 02a 5.ogg Paimon: But that's not the point! Paimon's not loopy!
Media:vo rzlq002 1 paimon 02a 6.ogg Paimon: Do you really not know that boy that lives with the wolves?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01a 5.ogg Amber: I. don't. know. what. you're. talking. about.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01a 6.ogg Amber: But on the subjects of wolves, I've been investigating something recently.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01a 7.ogg Amber: In the past, the wolves never dared venture outside of Wolvendom. But now they're getting braver.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01a 8.ogg Amber: I heard they attacked a cart fleet near Drunkard Gorge.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01a 9.ogg Amber: If you have time, could you come and check out the situation with me?
 Sure.
 Let's get to it.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01a 10.ogg Amber: Awesome! I knew I could count on you, let's go.
 Hey Amber, what's up?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01b.ogg Amber: Hi... Looks like you've got a bit of time on your hands.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 paimon 02b.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh, here it comes...
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01b 1.ogg Amber: I've been rushed off my feet recently. An Outrider's duties never end, so... Wanna help?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 paimon 02b 1.ogg Paimon: Told you so!
 Sure.
 What's the issue?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01b 2.ogg Amber: Recently, wolves have been attacking the carts at Drunkard Gorge.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01b 3.ogg Amber: As you know, wolves are dangerous, but they do have their own rules.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01b 4.ogg Amber: Mondstadt's wolves don't normally venture outside of the Brightcrown Mountains and Wolvendom.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 paimon 02b 2.ogg Paimon: Yes, Paimon heard someone say that those areas do have their own set of rules, even though they are wild and untouched by humans.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01b 5.ogg Amber: That's right. So for wolves to be showing up around Drunkard Gorge is very unusual.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 paimon 02b 3.ogg Paimon: Speaking of wolves, do you happen to know a wolf boy from Wolvendom?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01b 6.ogg Amber: Who? I've never heard of anyone like that around Mondstadt.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 paimon 02b 4.ogg Paimon: Um... What?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 paimon 02b 5.ogg Paimon: "The red one, burny girl"... That ain't you?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01b 7.ogg Amber: Burny...? What are you talking about?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01b 8.ogg Amber: Anyways, I'm off to Drunkard Gorge to investigate.
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01b 9.ogg Amber: Come with me!
 Let's get to it.
 Quest DescriptionOn your last legs from being attacked by an enormous slime, you were rescued by a young man named Razor. Razor, who calls a wolf pack family, mentioned a "red one, burny girl." You have your guesses as to who that is...
 Sure.
 What's the issue?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Hi Paimon, hi (Traveler)! What can I do for you?
Media:vo rzlq002 1 ambor 01a 1.ogg Amber: What on earth are you talking about?

Media:vo rzlq002 3 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Look, up ahead! Something's happening.
Media:vo rzlq002 3 ambor 02.ogg Amber: Huh. Not such a mystery after all.
Media:vo rzlq002 3 ambor 03.ogg Amber: Enough talk. Let's go help out!
Media:vo rzlq002 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: That ain't no wolf pack... looks like it's the hilichurls attacking the carts after all.
Media:vo rzlq002 5 ambor 01.ogg Amber: So, the hilichurls have been starting to flex their muscles on the back of the wolf scare.
Media:vo rzlq002 5 ambor 02.ogg Amber: Springvale!? That's crazy!
Media:vo rzlq002 5 ambor 03.ogg Amber: We should head there soon and see how bad the situation is.
Media:vo rzlq002 5 ambor 04.ogg Amber: But first things first, you should assess the damage to your cart. Does it still work?
Media:vo rzlq002 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Piece of cake!
Media:vo rzlq002 5 siegfria 01.ogg Siegfria: Bless you!
Media:vo rzlq002 5 siegfria 02.ogg Siegfria: That's right. But I must say, if you think the hilichurls are a nasty lot, the wolves are even worse.
Media:vo rzlq002 5 siegfria 03.ogg Siegfria: They... they attacked Springvale this morning.
Media:vo rzlq002 5 siegfria 04.ogg Siegfria: It's unheard of.
Media:vo rzlq002 5 siegfria 05.ogg Siegfria: I thought I would take my chances on the road after the wolves had their fun... I never thought the hilichurls would show up too.
Media:vo rzlq002 5 siegfria 06.ogg Siegfria: I'll take a look.
