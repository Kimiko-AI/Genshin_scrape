 Assuming no translation is needed for that...
 But I don't understand a word they're saying...
 I see...
 Look at this Hilichurlian scholar in action!

 Miss Musk, please... Be careful...

 Need me to step in?

Ella Musk: All we need to do is defeat its enemy. That's where you guys come in!
Ella Musk: And now it's pointing to the Map, saying that someone it knows over here may have seen the Unusual Hilichurl before.
Ella Musk: Dada!
Ella Musk: Dada! Muhe mani yeye!
Ella Musk: Haha, it said that it's very happy to make friends with us. But we need to do one small favor for it first...
Ella Musk: Huh, that's strange — this one claims to know nothing about it!
Ella Musk: I asked if it wanted any help from us, and sure enough, it seems like it does.
Ella Musk: I'm guessing that based on your experience over the past few days, you should be quite clear what this one wants. Thanks in advance.
Ella Musk: It directed us to this location. It said someone here will have seen it before.
Ella Musk: It doesn't know either. But, we can try asking one of its friends.
Ella Musk: It just isn't fond of talking. But I still managed to get the information we needed.
Ella Musk: It just wants us to help defeat an enemy. ...Here, on the Map.
Ella Musk: It needs us to defeat one of its enemies, and it's marked the location for us.
Ella Musk: It was... bullied... by someone very nasty. we need to help it vent its anger. That's all it wants.

Ella Musk: No, thank you. Everything's fine. I can understand.
Ella Musk: Oh... It's basically saying that it wants us to help it... defeat a strong enemy.
Ella Musk: Okay then, the location is marked on your Map — I'll leave the next part to you!
Ella Musk: Okay then, the location is marked on your Map — the rest is in your hands!
Ella Musk: Okay!
Ella Musk: Okay, the enemy's location is marked on the Map. Over to you!
Ella Musk: So, over to you now!
Ella Musk: The location is marked on the map. Hope you manage to find what you've been looking for this time!
Ella Musk: Valo!
