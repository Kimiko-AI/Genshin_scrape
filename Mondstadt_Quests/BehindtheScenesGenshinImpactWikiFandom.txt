 (Pretend to not have heard anything)
 ...Jean?
 Let's go!
(Proceeds to the next quest)
 Quest DescriptionIn your haste fleeing the confusion you found yourself in Diluc's tavern, where — to your surprise — he decided to help hide you. Diluc agrees to meet back at the tavern after nightfall with his "contacts" — who could they be?
 Sir?
 So are they going to take over the defense of Mondstadt?
 So they want to kill Dvalin?
 Wait a second.
(Dialogue ends, talk to Diluc again and choose "Let's go!" to proceed to the next quest)
 Why is the Acting Grand Master here?
Media:vo mdaq051 2 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Well, first of all, I contacted more than one person.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: Secondly, she came here as "Jean" herself, not as the Acting Grand Master.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: A Jean you would never see, even as an Honorary Knight.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: I understand this kind of absurd explanation is hard to believe.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: But, we can ask the bard to play the song again to try and persuade—
Media:vo mdaq051 2 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: To persuade our stubborn comman— Wait, what?
Media:vo mdaq051 2 diluc 07.ogg Diluc: Hmph.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 diluc 08.ogg Diluc: That's one of the reasons I don't like the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 diluc 09.ogg Diluc: What surprises me is that you would believe an outlander so easily...
Media:vo mdaq051 2 diluc 10.ogg Diluc: I already told you not to call me sir... Never mind. We don't often get to work together after all.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 diluc 11.ogg Diluc: ...
Media:vo mdaq051 2 diluc 12.ogg Diluc: The number of Fatui that have come to Mondstadt is far from limited.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 diluc 13.ogg Diluc: I've already managed to... coerce a few reports out of them.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 diluc 14.ogg Diluc: Hmph, such is the diplomacy between the seven nations.
(Cutscene ends)
Media:vo mdaq051 2 diluc 15.ogg Diluc: Outlander, ready to go?
Media:vo mdaq051 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Feels like we're breaking the law though...
Media:vo mdaq051 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wow! Um... This is really awkward...
Media:vo mdaq051 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Paimon gets it. If too much of a scene gets made then it becomes a big diplomatic issue.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 01.ogg Jean: Wait, you're... (Traveler)?
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 02.ogg Jean: What a surprise.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 03.ogg Jean: I heard about the Holy Lyre, but I never suspected it was you.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 04.ogg Jean: So, the sound of the Holy Lyre can purify Stormterror and return it to normal... Is that true?
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 05.ogg Jean: I believe you.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 06.ogg Jean: I can't think of any reason for Dvalin's betrayal, given it was once one of The Four Winds.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 07.ogg Jean: However, if it was poisoned in the battle over Mondstadt all those years ago...
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 08.ogg Jean: And then corrupted by the Abyss Mage after it woke up — we can't really blame it.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 09.ogg Jean: But as Acting Grand Master I obviously cannot make such a statement publicly.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 10.ogg Jean: Diplomatic pressure from the Fatui makes it hard for us to seek a peaceful resolution to the Stormterror issue.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 11.ogg Jean: People would think I've lost grip on the gravity of the situation. That's why I can only do this in private.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 12.ogg Jean: My cautious and meticulous superior, even you trust (him/her). Don't you, sir?
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 13.ogg Jean: ...
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 14.ogg Jean: I have a rough idea of where the Holy Lyre der Himmel is.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 15.ogg Jean: The conflict between Mondstadt and Snezhnaya stems from the conflict between the seven nations and their respective gods.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 16.ogg Jean: The Cryo God's Fatui seem to be after the Anemo God's power.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 17.ogg Jean: Right.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 18.ogg Jean: If the Knights of Favonius publicly prevented an attempt on Dvalin's head, then...
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 19.ogg Jean: The only other way to affect the Anemo God's power is to take the Holy Lyre.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 20.ogg Jean: Diluc has determined that the Holy Lyre is not being held in the Goth Grand Hotel.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 qin 21.ogg Jean: I imagine they don't want to leave something stolen in a place where it could be so easily found.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 venti 01.ogg Venti: You're here.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 venti 02.ogg Venti: That's right! (Traveler) is putting themselves on the front line to try and resolve this Stormterror issue.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 venti 03a.ogg Venti: Now that's the hotshot of the Knights of Favonius I'm talking about.
Media:vo mdaq051 2 venti 04.ogg Venti: (Nice recovery! She's really talented at changing the subject...)
Media:vo mdaq051 2 venti 05.ogg Venti: ...
