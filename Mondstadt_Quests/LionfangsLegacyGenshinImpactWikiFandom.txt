 (He's definitely a fraud. No question.)
 (I'm seriously starting to think so, too.)
 Almost fell for it myself!
 Excellent recovery.
 I agree with Venti!
 I agree, this is the shield.
 I'll pay good Mora for that shield.

 Mani nini Biaodomu.
 Mani nini Biaodomu. (unknown meaning, most likely "Anemo curses you" with "Biaodomu" is mispronounced "Biadam")
 Please may I have that shield?

 Quest DescriptionJack wants to search for Stanley's old weapons in secret, as they are the sword and shield passed down from the Lion of the South, and thus fascinate Jack greatly.
 That was some very elaborate ox dung.
 Venti is in top form today.
 Venti sing song, you give shield, okay?
 Vin plata dada!
Media:vo wdlq003 6 hilichurls 02a.ogg Hilichurl: Mosi mita! (+1 heart)
 Vin plata dada! [Wine shield good!]
Hilichurl: Mosi mita! (+1 heart) [Eat meat!] (literal, expression of approval)
(You approach the hilichurl)
Hilichurl: Biadam!
Hilichurl: Biadam! (-1 heart)
Hilichurl: Biadam! (Bad!)
Hilichurl: Dala? [What?]
Hilichurl: Mosi mita! (+1 heart) [Eat meat!] (literal, expression of approval)
Hilichurl: Muhe vin plata? Mani ye! Mani dada! [You want shield? Give you! Give good!]
Hilichurl: Yaya ika! Kundala ye plata! [humans enemy! Enemy/fight for your shield!]
Hilichurl: Yaya ika! Mani ye! [human enemies! you have it!]
Media:vo wdlq003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, that bunch of hilichurls... are they holding some kind of ceremony?
Media:vo wdlq003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: And what's with that pile of knickknacks? Are they worshipping them?
Media:vo wdlq003 1 venti 01.ogg Venti: Seems so! That must be the Sword of Brilliant Valor surely.
Media:vo wdlq003 4 jack 01.ogg Jack: This is in terrible shape! And it's so basic, I... I'm at a loss for words.
Media:vo wdlq003 4 jack 02.ogg Jack: You're right... you're right! Then this has to be it — this is the Sword of Brilliant Valor!
Media:vo wdlq003 4 jack 03.ogg Jack: What happened? Why did you stop all of a sudden?
Media:vo wdlq003 4 jack 04.ogg Jack: What? Where? I wanna see!
Media:vo wdlq003 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Are you sure? Looks kinda basic to Paimon, and a little worse for wear too!
Media:vo wdlq003 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Why would hilichurls be bowing down before a piece of junk like this?
Media:vo wdlq003 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: There's somebody there!
(You spot Stanley eavesdropping nearby before he runs away)
Media:vo wdlq003 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: He's acting so weird...
Media:vo wdlq003 4 venti 01.ogg Venti: Eh-he. Lo and behold, the Sword of Brilliant Valor!
Media:vo wdlq003 4 venti 02.ogg Venti: (Ahh... Seems somebody tossed an old sword into a pile of spoils these hilichurls were already celebrating...)
Media:vo wdlq003 4 venti 03.ogg Venti: Hmm... say, Jack, have you ever seen an Anemo Crystalfly? They're found in the open country around Mondstadt City.
Media:vo wdlq003 4 venti 04.ogg Venti: If you saw one in broad daylight, you wouldn't bat an eyelid. But in the pitch blackness of night? Its brilliant glow is mesmerizing — it truly resembles an exquisite crystal dancing in the night air.
Media:vo wdlq003 4 venti 05.ogg Venti: Is valor not the same? When everything is going your way, it seems meaningless — fades into the background. But when you're in dire straits, valor is the thing that gets you fired up and fighting back. It's the brilliant ray of light that guides you out from the darkness.
Media:vo wdlq003 4 venti 06.ogg Venti: Mm-hmm. So we got our sword, now we just need that shield!
Media:vo wdlq003 4 venti 07.ogg Venti: Let's scout around! It's definitely in Dadaupa Gorge some— huh?
Media:vo wdlq003 4 venti 08.ogg Venti: Stanley? What's he doing here?
Media:vo wdlq003 4 venti 09.ogg Venti: Huh? Oh, ah, it's nothing. Just one of those Mora-spouting weasel thieves passed by is all.
Media:vo wdlq003 4 venti 10.ogg Venti: Maybe another time. We have a shield to find, remember?
Media:vo wdlq003 5 jack 01.ogg Jack: There's also wine stains on it... Yeah, I'm pretty sure this was just taken from a wine barrel...
Media:vo wdlq003 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Liar, liar, pants on fire! It's a chunk of wood!
Media:vo wdlq003 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: A chunk of scrap wood with a handle attached... Who in their right mind would use this as a shield!?
Media:vo wdlq003 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You do have a point... Shiny new shields don't stay new and shiny for long...
Media:vo wdlq003 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Okay then... Well, maybe if we ask nicely, he'll just let us take the Shield of Magnificent Honor for free?
(You approach the hilichurl)
Media:vo wdlq003 5 venti 01.ogg Venti: Lo and behold, the Shield of Magnificent Honor!
Media:vo wdlq003 5 venti 02.ogg Venti: And yet, my bard's intuition tells me that this is none other than the Shield of Magnificent Honor.
Media:vo wdlq003 5 venti 03.ogg Venti: Warriors wear their battle scars with pride, and shields are no different.
Media:vo wdlq003 5 venti 04.ogg Venti: Surely, an intact shield is one that has shied away from the battlefield. Is not the broken and splintered shield the one that has fought in countless wars and lived to tell the tale?
Media:vo wdlq003 5 venti 05.ogg Venti: Though the soldier's body be tired and torn, still they fight till the very end, till they have no blood left to bleed. Such magnificent strength of will... is that not the true meaning of honor?

Media:vo wdlq003 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: *clears throat* Excuse me, Mr. Hilichurl?
Media:vo wdlq003 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Welp! Okay, you take it from here, (Traveler)! Hope you've picked up some Hilichurlian by now. If not, there's always body language...
Media:vo wdlq003 6 paimon 03a.ogg Paimon: Seems cheerful enough. Maybe negotiations will work after all...
Media:vo wdlq003 6 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh... He did not seem to appreciate that.
Media:vo wdlq003 6 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh... He did not seem to appreciate that.

Media:vo wdlq003 9 jack 01.ogg Jack: Guys, thank you so much! I can't believe I actually found them!
Media:vo wdlq003 9 jack 02.ogg Jack: Mom! Dad! Check out the legendary weapons I found!
(Jack runs back to Mondstadt)
Media:vo wdlq003 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: (Paimon's starting to think Stanley might be a fraud...)
Media:vo wdlq003 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: (Did Stanley plant the sword and shield here in advance so as to not hurt Jack's feelings?)
Media:vo wdlq003 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Guilty conscience, huh?
Media:vo wdlq003 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: What are you talking about?
Media:vo wdlq003 9 stanley 01.ogg Stanley: Ah... haha, ah— hey!... What're you doing here, bard! Fancy that, huh? You, uh... out for a stroll too?
Media:vo wdlq003 9 stanley 02.ogg Stanley: You'd better believe it! I could navigate this whole area with my eyes closed!
Media:vo wdlq003 9 stanley 03.ogg Stanley: It's only to be expected of a great adventurer like me! You guys had better watch out though. This place is crawling with hilichurls!
Media:vo wdlq003 9 stanley 04.ogg Stanley: I, ah— I'll get back to my, um... ah... stroll now. Goodbye.
(Stanley walks off)
Media:vo wdlq003 9 venti 01.ogg Venti: Hey, wait!
Media:vo wdlq003 9 venti 02.ogg Venti: The wine, you promised! Ugh, and I actually helped a lot this time—
Media:vo wdlq003 9 venti 03.ogg Venti: Hmm? What're you doing here, Stanley? Out for a stroll?
(Stanley comes out from his hiding place)
Media:vo wdlq003 9 venti 04.ogg Venti: That's right, an after-dinner stroll to be precise. We were also helping a friend look for something.
Media:vo wdlq003 9 venti 05.ogg Venti: Adventurers must be pretty familiar with Dadaupa Gorge? You've fought battles here before, after all.
Media:vo wdlq003 9 venti 06.ogg Venti: Wow. Then I admire your perseverance, and your memory too.
Media:vo wdlq003 9 venti 07.ogg Venti: Well, he shouldn't have gotten so carried away bragging to Jack, should he?
Media:vo wdlq003 9 venti 08.ogg Venti: Although... on further reflection, I must say I'm intrigued.
Media:vo wdlq003 9 venti 09.ogg Venti: Someone who can't let go of the past, and gives up on the present instead...
Media:vo wdlq003 9 venti 10.ogg Venti: I wonder... if such a person was forced to take their first step towards the future, which way would they go?
Media:vo wdlq003 9 venti 11.ogg Venti: Haha, I'm just musing to myself.
Media:vo wdlq003 9 venti 12.ogg Venti: Anyway, (Traveler), I propose we take a trip to Angel's Share tonight.
Paimon: *clears throat* Excuse me, Mr. Hilichurl?
