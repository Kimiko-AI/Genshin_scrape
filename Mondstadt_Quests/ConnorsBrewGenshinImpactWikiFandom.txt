 A little bird told me that someone wants Mist Flower Corollas...
 About the wheat...
 Here they are.
(After giving the Dandelion Seeds)
Connor: Yes... These Dandelion Seeds should last me for a while.
Connor: Please accept this. Thanks for helping me out.
 Here they are.
(After giving the Flaming Flower Stamens)
Connor: Yes, this will do. Please accept this small token from me as thanks for your help.
Connor: While I'm not certain if we can brew anything sufficiently special with these ingredients...
Connor: But I'm sure that this will be a memorable brewing experience nonetheless.
 Here they are.
(After giving the Mist Flower Corollas)
Connor: My, my... These Mist Flower Corollas are of fine quality indeed.
Connor: Please, take these — consider them a token of my appreciation.
 Here they are.
(After giving the Wheat)
Connor: Let me see... Yes, I think this is enough.
Connor: Thank you. Please accept a token of my appreciation...
 Not yet.
Connor: Not yet, eh... Well, be sure to give them to me once you've got them. I need to start brewing wine soon.
 Not yet.
Connor: Please hurry, then. I'm due to use them to brew up some wine.
 Not yet.
Connor: Well then, give them to me as soon as you're done gathering them. I have wine to brew.
