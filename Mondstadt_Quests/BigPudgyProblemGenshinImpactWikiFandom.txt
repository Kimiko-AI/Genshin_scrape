 No way, old man.
Tunner: I would happily do it myself, but at my age my strength is not what it used to be... For a youngster like you, this should be no problem. Come on, make an old man's day.
(The quest continues to Strange Location)
 Quest DescriptionSlimes have suddenly shown up on the Mondstadt docks/at Dawn Winery/on the mountain behind Springvale, and it seems Arthur/Tunner/Timid Morrow has become caught up in the commotion...Slimes suddenly appeared on the docks of Mondstadt/at Dawn Winery. Put an end to the mess they created by getting rid of them.
 Sorry, I have to get back.
Timid Morrow: Please (sir/ma'am), if not for me, then for the sake of everyone in Springvale.
(The quest continues to Strange Location)
 Sorry, I've got too much on my plate right now.
Arthur: B–But... I cannot get my father involved... Please, you're the only one who can help me!
(The quest continues to Strange Location)
 Sure thing, old man.
Tunner: Bless you, child! I will rest better for it.
(The quest continues to Strange Location)
 Sure, I have time.
Timid Morrow: You're doing me a great service. Well, I'd better get back and report all this to Draff.
Timid Morrow: Here's hoping he isn't too drunk that it goes in one ear and out the other!
(The quest continues to Strange Location)
 Sure, it won't take me long.
Arthur: Great! Looks like my father will never have to find out...
(The quest continues to Strange Location)
Arthur: B–But... I cannot get my father involved... Please, you're the only one who can help me!
Arthur: Great! Looks like my father will never have to find out...
Arthur: Help me! Help me!
Arthur: If you don't mind, could you check the coast is clear now? And if not, get rid of the slimes for me?
Arthur: Please don't tell my father... He's already been nagging me to stay at home, saying the slimes 'round here are supposed to be getting more hostile recently.
Arthur: Thank you! You saved my life.
Arthur: Those slimes came out of nowhere. I didn't think they would show up around these parts... Before I knew what was happening, I was surrounded!
Arthur: With slimes appearing closer to the city I've been stuck at home for days now. I managed to slip out today without him noticing.
Paimon: *gasp* Where'd all these slimes come from!? Was there something in that elemental dust we don't know about...
(After defeating all the enemy slimes)
Paimon: And there's something spooky about those weird elemental traces...
Paimon: Elemental or not, it's still dust — you should be able to blow it away easily enough with your Anemo abilities.
(After blowing away the dust)
Paimon: Ooh, what have we here? It looks like dust, but... with elemental traces on.
Paimon: Poof! Gone, just like that.
Paimon: That's the last of them. But I wonder what they were doing hanging around here?
Paimon: Well, I suppose it can't hurt to have cleared the area of slimes. It can only make the area safer.
Timid Morrow: Can you check the road ahead for slimes? If you see any... you know what to do.
Timid Morrow: Help! Help me!
Timid Morrow: Here's hoping he isn't too drunk that it goes in one ear and out the other!
Timid Morrow: I may be a hunter by trade, but I've sure met my match with these darned slimes.
Timid Morrow: I sure hope them other hunters ain't as unfortunate as me.
Timid Morrow: It could just be my imagination, but... they seem to be showing up more and more 'round this town.
Timid Morrow: Please (sir/ma'am), if not for me, then for the sake of everyone in Springvale.
Timid Morrow: Speaking of slimes and such... could you take a look-see around here for me?
Timid Morrow: Thanks to them, once again I got nothing to show for this hunt. Ain't caught squat.
Timid Morrow: Th—Thank you kindly, (sir/ma'am)...
Timid Morrow: You're doing me a great service. Well, I'd better get back and report all this to Draff.
Tunner: *sigh* Please don't say a word about this to my son. He's one of the Knights of Favonius, so I'm sure he has enough to worry about as it is.
Tunner: Bless you, child! I will rest better for it.
Tunner: Help! Help me!
Tunner: I don't know if you have the time to spare for an old man like me... but if so, could you chase off the slimes in the area for me, to stop them from getting at my grapes?
Tunner: I just wanted to tend to the grape vines, and then... this happened.
Tunner: I would happily do it myself, but at my age my strength is not what it used to be... For a youngster like you, this should be no problem. Come on, make an old man's day.
Tunner: Recently, though, we do seem to be having a bit of a slime problem around the winery area. I worry constantly that they'll demolish my grape vines. It's keeping me up at night.
Tunner: Thank you, (Traveler)...
Tunner: There's no need to bother him over a silly old man getting himself into a bit of a pickle.
