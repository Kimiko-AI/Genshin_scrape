 "Last time," you say?
 ...Huh?
 ...I sense something familiar. On that cliff.
 And I will find (her/him).
 And if I answer wrongly?
 Another day, another lack of alcoholic options...
 But if he's already rejected the Guild...
 Come to think of it, since the Stormterror incident ended, we haven't...
 Could it be... the Abyss?
 Could it be...?
 Could you tell me more about the Abyss Order?
 Do I need to answer them all correctly?
 Emergency food.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 paimon 03a.ogg Paimon: That's not true, and you know it!
 Everyone in Liyue Harbor.
 Getting a bit ahead of ourselves, I think...
 H-how much?
 Hi, I'm an adventurer with the Adventurers' Guild.
 How did you know that Venti is...!?
 How do you do? I'm an Honorary Knight of Favonius...
 I felt it for a moment the previous time we came here, too...
 I'll defeat them.
 I'm looking for my lost relative.
 I'm recruiting new allies...
 I... could feel (her/him).
 It is quite a shame.
 It was Venti.
 It was me.
 It's nearby.
 More companions would be nice...
 My best chum.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: Uh-huh, we're the best of friends!
 P-payment, you say...
 Perhaps... none of them do.
 Quest DescriptionKatheryne of the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild seems to have something to tell you.
 Regardless, I have to get to the bottom of th—!
 So, I'm looking for a stranger with an eyepatch...
 So, just some distant relative of Kaeya's, then...
 So, uh, I'm a traveler...
 Sounds like a tough customer...
 Speaking from experience, are we?
 Step DescriptionKatheryne from the Adventurers' Guild in Mondstadt informs you that a very peculiar stranger has come to the city. To ask for his help, you meet him at the Angel's Share tavern. The man, who introduced himself as Dainsleif, accepts your request right away, asking only for 500 Mora and three questions in return. Per his advice, you head to the Temple of the Falcon to track down the Abyss Herald. Once the monsters inside the temple are defeated, you decide to look for more traces of the Abyss Herald in Wolvendom.

 That's... it?
 The Liyue Qixing.
 The adepti.
 The unity of Mondstadt's people gave us the victory.
 They won't defeat me.
 This dandelion... reminds me of...
 Those with Visions.
 Those without Visions.
 We found lots of signs of the Abyss Order...
 Well, I have met some Abyss Mages in the past...
 Well, I was hoping to invite you to adventure with us...
 Well, alright then.
 Well, alright then. About that stranger...
 Well, here's the 500 Mora...
 What are you talking about?
 What do you mean, "(her/him)"?
 Yes, the moment I touched it...
 You familiar with that wolf?
 You know that wolf?
 You seem to be familiar with journeys.
 You've been here before?
(If the player picked the third option at least twice)
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 30a.ogg Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 30b.ogg Dainsleif: As I thought... you really are similar to (her/him).
(Otherwise)
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 31a.ogg Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 31b.ogg Dainsleif: It seems that you're different from (her/him)...
???: ...
Media:vo dialog wqdy001 charles 01.ogg Charles: That customer will most likely be here tonight. You can wait on the second floor until he arrives.
Media:vo dialog wqdy001 lawrence 01.ogg Lawrence: Huh... I wonder what trouble this stranger brings with him...
Media:vo dialog wqdy001 wagner 01.ogg Wagner: Do those forging materials even exist?
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 01.ogg Katheryne: Traveler, please, over here.
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 02.ogg Katheryne: It has been a while since you joined the Adventurers' Guild. Are your adventures going smoothly?
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 03.ogg Katheryne: Hmm... is that so? Apart from your own skills, reliable teammates are also indispensable when adventuring.
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 04.ogg Katheryne: Another person to count on is always good, after all. But recruiting such dependable companions is no easy matter, is it?
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 05.ogg Katheryne: Ah, yes, I do have some information that may be of help to you...
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 06.ogg Katheryne: Let me consult our records... Ah, there it is. There's been a certain blond stranger who arrived in Mondstadt lately, dressed in the most unusual clothes.
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 07.ogg Katheryne: Hmm? Like the Honorary Knight's? No, they couldn't look more different. This stranger is a very tall man, and even has an eyepatch...
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 08.ogg Katheryne: That stranger declined the Guild's invitation, so I can't say that I know anything about the relationship between him and Mr. Kaeya.
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 09.ogg Katheryne: Nonetheless, you can look for him if you're interested. Perhaps he might accept your commission instead.
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 10.ogg Katheryne: After all, it is not uncommon for some adventurers to not want to be limited by the Guild, but be happy to accept a fellow adventurer's requests.
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 11.ogg Katheryne: And should this stranger be a strong adventurer indeed, he would certainly be a big help on your journey.
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 12.ogg Katheryne: Please don't talk down on yourself like that. You are the Honorary Knight of the Knights of Favonius, after all.
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 13.ogg Katheryne: Your deeds are the stuff of song for all the bards in the city even now.
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 14.ogg Katheryne: Well, as to further news about him... You may want to ask Mr. Lawrence.
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 15.ogg Katheryne: He stands guard at the city gate, so he may know something about that stranger.
Media:vo wqdy001 1 katheryne 16.ogg Katheryne: I wish you every success, adventurer.
Media:vo wqdy001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yup, and it's even harder to get a guide as good as Paimon.
Media:vo wqdy001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Blond... dresses all funny... It feels like Paimon's heard this one before...
Media:vo wqdy001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: W—wait— do you mean...
Media:vo wqdy001 1 paimon 04a.ogg Media:vo wqdy001 1 paimon 04b.ogg Paimon: Does that stranger's face look... anything like (his/hers)!?
Media:vo wqdy001 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Seriously? How does this have anything to do with Kaeya? Eyepatches can't prove that you're related, anyway!
Media:vo wqdy001 10 dainsleif 01.ogg Dainsleif: This abandoned temple does bear some marks of the Abyss.
Media:vo wqdy001 10 dainsleif 02.ogg Dainsleif: The Falcon of the West... though it can soar in the wind, it ultimately does naught but hover under the light of the gods...
Media:vo wqdy001 10 dainsleif 03.ogg Dainsleif: Mm? Oh, it's nothing. Let's head inside.
Media:vo wqdy001 12 dainsleif 01.ogg Dainsleif: The scent of the Abyss is getting stronger. It's not far now.
Media:vo wqdy001 12 dainsleif 02.ogg Dainsleif: Let's head further in first. If we do see that creature, that'll spare me the explanation either way.
Media:vo wqdy001 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Paimon wonders what the Abyss Heralds look like. Do they look something like the Abyss Mages?
Media:vo wqdy001 13 dainsleif 01.ogg Dainsleif: Just a few Abyss Mages? Seems like that Herald might have already left.
Media:vo wqdy001 13 dainsleif 02.ogg Dainsleif: The Abyss...
Media:vo wqdy001 13 dainsleif 03.ogg Dainsleif: It is chaos, and it is also destruction. It is a morass of inconceivable madness that encroaches upon this world's very foundations.
Media:vo wqdy001 13 dainsleif 04.ogg Dainsleif: That... is why even the Dragon of the East, a servant of a deity, was unable to resist its corrosive powers.
Media:vo wqdy001 13 dainsleif 05.ogg Dainsleif: And the creatures of the Abyss desire nothing less than the overthrow of a world ruled by the archons.
Media:vo wqdy001 13 dainsleif 06.ogg Dainsleif: Haha, well, we do have... some history.
Media:vo wqdy001 13 dainsleif 07.ogg Dainsleif: I suppose that's as far as chit-chat goes. We should head to Wolvendom.
Media:vo wqdy001 13 dainsleif 08.ogg Dainsleif: Judging by the traces I'm following, their next appearance my be within the territory of that old wolf.
Media:vo wqdy001 13 dainsleif 09.ogg Dainsleif: Perhaps we may find our Abyss Herald there.
Media:vo wqdy001 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: You seem to know a lot about the Abyss, Dain.
Media:vo wqdy001 15 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Well, we're in Wolvendom now. Think Dain's waiting for us up ahead?
Media:vo wqdy001 15 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We should meet up with him quick, in case the wolves decide they don't like him.
Media:vo wqdy001 16 dainsleif 01.ogg Dainsleif: Lord of Wolvendom, Great Wolf King of the North...
Media:vo wqdy001 16 dainsleif 02.ogg Dainsleif: Sharp of fang and keen of claw, and yet dwelling here only...
Media:vo wqdy001 16 dainsleif 03.ogg Dainsleif: No, nor does it know me.
Media:vo wqdy001 16 dainsleif 04.ogg Dainsleif: I only know these things because a previous traveling companion of mine once wanted to hear its story.
Media:vo wqdy001 16 dainsleif 05.ogg Dainsleif: Alright, let's go see if that Abyss Herald has stopped by here.
Media:vo wqdy001 16 dainsleif 06.ogg Dainsleif: Indeed. See that, floating above the flames? It's an Abyssal spell.
Media:vo wqdy001 16 dainsleif 07.ogg Dainsleif: Knowing what I do of the Order's habits, they've probably left similar marks behind elsewhere. Let's have a look nearby.
Media:vo wqdy001 16 dainsleif 08.ogg Dainsleif: So, their reach extends here, too... Let's have a closer look.
Media:vo wqdy001 16 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: But where do we begin? ...Hmm, are you standing here because of these strange bonfires, Dain?
Media:vo wqdy001 17 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: And there's another one of those bonfire-spells!
Media:vo wqdy001 17 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Looks like the Abyss really has been around here...
Media:vo wqdy001 17 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yikes! Where did these monsters pop out from? Let's clear them out, and quick!
Media:vo wqdy001 17 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Do you think that those monsters by the bonfire are under the Abyss Order's control? Looks kinda scary... Let's beat 'em up first.
Media:vo wqdy001 17 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Phew! That's that. Let's go check out that bonfire.
Media:vo wqdy001 17 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Looks like this bonfire's also got something to do with the Abyss...
Media:vo wqdy001 2 lawrence 01.ogg Lawrence: Ah, Honorary Knight. Is something the matter?
Media:vo wqdy001 2 lawrence 02.ogg Lawrence: A stranger with an eyepatch? Hmm... let me think. Oh yeah. I remember seeing someone like that. A blond stranger dressed in unusual garb.
Media:vo wqdy001 2 lawrence 03.ogg Lawrence: He was wandering all over Mondstadt at first, which I found rather suspicious, so I decided to keep an eye on him for a while.
Media:vo wqdy001 2 lawrence 04.ogg Lawrence: I lost him pretty quickly... Still, I didn't think that this was such a huge matter that we needed our Outrider to pursue him by air.
Media:vo wqdy001 2 lawrence 05.ogg Lawrence: As long as Master Jean is here, there's nothing to fear from some suspicious unusual-looking person.
Media:vo wqdy001 2 lawrence 06.ogg Lawrence: Haha, that is true. But on the other hand, knowing that Master Jean may overreact to the situation is all the more reason to not tell her, no?
Media:vo wqdy001 2 lawrence 07.ogg Lawrence: Anyways... Oh, yeah! He was at Wagner's smithy for a while before I tried tailin' him. He might have said something to Wagner.
Media:vo wqdy001 2 lawrence 08.ogg Lawrence: You should go ask, him. Maybe he has more news about our stranger.
Media:vo wqdy001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: That might be true, but if it were up to Jean, she'd take this way more seriously.
Media:vo wqdy001 20 dainsleif 01.ogg Dainsleif: Have you finished searching?
Media:vo wqdy001 20 dainsleif 02.ogg Dainsleif: I searched around these parts and found some signs myself.
Media:vo wqdy001 20 dainsleif 03.ogg Dainsleif: But they were left behind by Abyss Mages, and there was no deeper Abyssal power to them.
Media:vo wqdy001 20 dainsleif 04.ogg Dainsleif: It seems that even an Abyss Herald would not wish to make trouble with the Wolf King of the North.
Media:vo wqdy001 20 dainsleif 05.ogg Dainsleif: We should leave as well. If there's anything praiseworthy about that old wolf, it's his territorial nature.
Media:vo wqdy001 20 dainsleif 06.ogg Dainsleif: No, there is one more place we can go.
Media:vo wqdy001 20 dainsleif 07.ogg Dainsleif: Let's get a move on, then. I'll wait for you at Stormterror's Lair.
Media:vo wqdy001 20 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: But now we're out of leads. Are we going to have to give up?
Media:vo wqdy001 21 dainsleif 01.ogg Dainsleif: I've heard about what happened to you during Mondstadt's crisis. When you came, this place was known as Stormterror's Lair.
Media:vo wqdy001 21 dainsleif 02.ogg Dainsleif: But I suppose that this place is more "lair" than "Stormterror" at this point.
Media:vo wqdy001 21 dainsleif 03.ogg Dainsleif: In fact, if my memory serves, this ruin has had largely nothing to do with that dragon for a long time.
Media:vo wqdy001 21 dainsleif 04.ogg Dainsleif: The first time I laid eyes upon the ruins of Old Mondstadt, the Dragon of the East had yet to fall, much less come to nest in this place.
Media:vo wqdy001 21 dainsleif 05.ogg Dainsleif: Don't think too much about it.
Media:vo wqdy001 21 dainsleif 06.ogg Dainsleif: Do you remember the Light Actuators that once sealed this ruin?
Media:vo wqdy001 21 dainsleif 07.ogg Dainsleif: If the Abyss Order is interested in this location, then they will not neglect those mechanisms.
Media:vo wqdy001 21 dainsleif 08.ogg Dainsleif: Let's go see what the situation is at those Light Actuators.
Media:vo wqdy001 21 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? But Paimon remembers that Dvalin first got into trouble hundred of years ago...
Media:vo wqdy001 22 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Look, there are lots of monsters gathered over there!
Media:vo wqdy001 24 dainsleif 01.ogg Dainsleif: I wouldn't call not having to gaze upon such a creature a "shame," exactly. Still, I do believe that you will come across one eventually.
Media:vo wqdy001 24 dainsleif 02.ogg Dainsleif: *sigh* How good it would be if all perils one encounters in their journeys could simply be solved by going around them.
Media:vo wqdy001 24 dainsleif 03.ogg Dainsleif: Once upon a time, yes... I simply have the experience from adventuring together with that traveling companion.
Media:vo wqdy001 24 dainsleif 04a.ogg Media:vo wqdy001 24 dainsleif 04b.ogg Dainsleif: (She/He)... *sigh*
Media:vo wqdy001 24 dainsleif 05a.ogg Dainsleif: No longer travels.
Media:vo wqdy001 24 dainsleif 06.ogg Dainsleif: I'm afraid that traveling can be... too exhausting at times.
Media:vo wqdy001 24 dainsleif 07.ogg Dainsleif: I... still have some things left unfinished. Once they are done, I too will return home to rest.
Media:vo wqdy001 24 dainsleif 08.ogg Dainsleif: Home...
Media:vo wqdy001 24 dainsleif 09.ogg Dainsleif: Well, it won't be too late to think about where you stay once your journey reaches its end.
Media:vo wqdy001 24 dainsleif 10.ogg Dainsleif: While you're still traveling, you should...
Media:vo wqdy001 24 dainsleif 11.ogg Dainsleif: A familiar feeling, you say? It could be someone you know well, or perhaps a monster.
Media:vo wqdy001 24 dainsleif 12.ogg Dainsleif: Whichever it is, we should see it for ourselves, and thus see clearly.
Media:vo wqdy001 24 dainsleif 13.ogg Dainsleif: We can reach the top of that cliff from over there. Let's go.
Media:vo wqdy001 24 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So in the end, we still couldn't find that Abyss Herald. Bummer.
Media:vo wqdy001 24 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: N—No... You're right. If it's a really powerful monster, it would be best to go around it...
Media:vo wqdy001 24 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Uh, you know, Dain, you keep talking about that person this, and that person that...
Media:vo wqdy001 24 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Where are they now, anyway?
Media:vo wqdy001 24 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh, is that how it is... Well, why are you traveling alone, then?
Media:vo wqdy001 24 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Yup, and it's good to have a home to come back to, isn't it? We camp out a lot when we travel.
Media:vo wqdy001 24 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Hey Traveler, once you find your sibling, we should find a place to stay too, shouldn't we?
Media:vo wqdy001 24 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Mondstadt's Fisherman's Toast is pretty tasty, but Liyue's Wanmin Restaurant is great too...
Media:vo wqdy001 24 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Eh, either way, we should settle down in a place where there's good food!
Media:vo wqdy001 24 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Eh? What's familiar?
Media:vo wqdy001 24 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Dain moves really fast, doesn't he...
Media:vo wqdy001 24 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Let's use that wind current nearby to catch up.
Media:vo wqdy001 25 dainsleif 01.ogg Dainsleif: Can you still sense that familiar feeling that you spoke of earlier?
Media:vo wqdy001 25 dainsleif 02.ogg Dainsleif: Indeed, there doesn't seem to be anything strange about this place. It doesn't look any different from the last time I was here...
Media:vo wqdy001 25 dainsleif 03.ogg Dainsleif: My traveling companion brought me here on our previous journey.
Media:vo wqdy001 25 dainsleif 04.ogg Dainsleif: Me? I... no longer remember.
Media:vo wqdy001 25 dainsleif 05.ogg Dainsleif: I merely followed my traveling companion around on that journey. That's all there was to it.
Media:vo wqdy001 25 dainsleif 06.ogg Dainsleif: ...Hmm?
Media:vo wqdy001 25 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: But... it doesn't feel like there's anything around here. No monsters, no people, nothing.
Media:vo wqdy001 25 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So, Dain, what about you? What's your favorite place?
Media:vo wqdy001 26 dainsleif 01.ogg Dainsleif: A Ruin Guard's footprint... A Ruin Guard was wandering around here?
Media:vo wqdy001 26 dainsleif 02.ogg Dainsleif: No peace to be found, even for a single dandelion...
Media:vo wqdy001 27 dainsleif 01.ogg Dainsleif: ...
Media:vo wqdy001 27 dainsleif 02.ogg Dainsleif: Perhaps that dandelion bears some sort of "scent" that only you recognize.
Media:vo wqdy001 27 dainsleif 03.ogg Dainsleif: As for why... has it perhaps experienced something related to you?
Media:vo wqdy001 27 dainsleif 04.ogg Dainsleif: Do not rush.
Media:vo wqdy001 27 dainsleif 05.ogg Dainsleif: Vexation and anxiety are the enemy of rational thought. Your journey has only just begun, has it not?
Media:vo wqdy001 27 dainsleif 06a.ogg Media:vo wqdy001 27 dainsleif 06b.ogg Dainsleif: At least you now know that (she/he) is still on this world.
Media:vo wqdy001 27 dainsleif 07a.ogg Media:vo wqdy001 27 dainsleif 07b.ogg Dainsleif: At this time, the most important thing is the journey to find (her/him) itself.
Media:vo wqdy001 27 dainsleif 08.ogg Dainsleif: Yes, and this is something you must keep in mind as the meaning behind your journey.
Media:vo wqdy001 27 dainsleif 09.ogg Dainsleif: May your find your kin at the end of that journey. Well then, let us part ways here for now.
Media:vo wqdy001 27 dainsleif 10.ogg Dainsleif: Only for now. Don't worry, we will meet again.
Media:vo wqdy001 27 dainsleif 11.ogg Dainsleif: After all... I did take 500 Mora... and those three answers you gave me.
Media:vo wqdy001 27 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What's gotten into you? You were just spacing out!
Media:vo wqdy001 27 paimon 02a.ogg Media:vo wqdy001 27 paimon 02b.ogg Paimon: Eh? You mean your (sister/brother)?
Media:vo wqdy001 27 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: But, how could that be... You only touched that dandelion for a second!
Media:vo wqdy001 27 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Uh, you're saying some real confusing stuff. Paimon doesn't get it at all...
Media:vo wqdy001 27 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Eh? You're leaving? Already?
Media:vo wqdy001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: The Angel's Share? Well, Master Diluc probably has his eye on that stranger too, then.
Media:vo wqdy001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Anyway, let's go to the Angel's Share and have a look.
Media:vo wqdy001 3 wagner 01.ogg Wagner: What? You need something?
Media:vo wqdy001 3 wagner 02.ogg Wagner: I remember him. He showed up a few days ago, asking to buy a bunch of forging materials.
Media:vo wqdy001 3 wagner 03.ogg Wagner: Can't say I've heard of any of the materials he mentioned, though.
Media:vo wqdy001 3 wagner 04.ogg Wagner: He then had a look at the weapons in my shop before leaving. I've heard that he can be found drinking at the Angel's Share.
Media:vo wqdy001 3 wagner 05.ogg Wagner: If the Knights or the Guild want to get a hold of him, that's the only place to be, haha.
Media:vo wqdy001 4 charles 01.ogg Charles: What will it be? grape juice or apple cider?
Media:vo wqdy001 4 charles 02.ogg Charles: That I have. He comes here every night — just to drink, though. Doesn't order anything else.
Media:vo wqdy001 4 charles 03.ogg Charles: He even sometimes mixes his own drinks after he orders them.
Media:vo wqdy001 4 charles 04.ogg Charles: I don't know anything else about him, but from his selections and mixes, I'd say that he's quite the connoisseur.
Media:vo wqdy001 4 charles 05.ogg Charles: Why, I just gave it to you — "quite the connoisseur."
Media:vo wqdy001 4 charles 06.ogg Charles: If you're looking for that gentleman, he ordered some new bottle of wine in advance yesterday, so he should be here today, too.
Media:vo wqdy001 4 charles 07.ogg Charles: There's too many raucous patrons on the first floor, so if you want to wait, best to go to the second.
Media:vo wqdy001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey Charles, have you seen a blond stranger who wears an eyepatch around here by any chance?
Media:vo wqdy001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: And what's Master Diluc's opinion?
Media:vo wqdy001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Investigating everything as always — guess that's Diluc for you...
Media:vo wqdy001 5 charles 01.ogg Charles: Ah, welcome sir. The wine that you previously ordered is here.
Media:vo wqdy001 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: He's really here!? Let's go downstairs and have a look.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 03.ogg ???: A traveler... you say? Hmph. Why are you traveling?
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 04.ogg ???: ...
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 05.ogg ???: Well, that's as good a reason as any... Sit down over there, then.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 06.ogg ???: Hmm. That little one beside you...
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 07.ogg ???: It's indeed a good thing to have someone accompany you on your travels.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 08.ogg Dainsleif: My name's Dainsleif. I suppose you have some business with me?
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 09.ogg Dainsleif: Sure.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 10.ogg Dainsleif: But I will require advance payment.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 11.ogg Dainsleif: 500 Mora, and three answered questions.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 12.ogg Dainsleif: The 500 is a one-time fee, and we'll settle the questions in a moment.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 13.ogg Dainsleif: That's it.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 14.ogg Dainsleif: Ah, thank you. Now, as for my questions, I'd like you to answer them here and now...
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 15.ogg Dainsleif: The answer to a question says nothing about right and wrong. Only about differences in attitude.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 16.ogg Dainsleif: I only wish to know what your choices are. You need only answer.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 17.ogg Dainsleif: Question one.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 18.ogg Dainsleif: The crisis Mondstadt faced was resolved by an alliance between yourself and that... Anemo Archon who calls himself Venti. Who, in your view, was the key to ending that crisis?
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 19.ogg Dainsleif: I know everything that I should.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 20.ogg Dainsleif: Haha... Well...? Answer the question.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 21.ogg Dainsleif: Is that your answer? Hm... I see.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 22.ogg Dainsleif: Question number two.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 23.ogg Dainsleif: Rex Lapis, who has defended Liyue Harbor for millennia on end, used his Gnosis to lay down a Contract to End All Contracts, of which the stipulations are still unknown.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 24.ogg Dainsleif: Who do you think will defend Liyue Harbor in the future, now that they've lost their deity?
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 25.ogg Dainsleif: So that's your answer... I see.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 26.ogg Dainsleif: Now for my final question.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 27.ogg Dainsleif: This world has people who gained Visions, and those who did not.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 28.ogg Dainsleif: Which of the two do you think hold more importance in the eyes of the gods?
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 29.ogg Dainsleif: So... this is your answer, then... I understand.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 30a.ogg Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 30b.ogg Dainsleif: As I thought... you really are similar to (her/him).
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 31a.ogg Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 31b.ogg Dainsleif: It seems that you're different from (her/him)...
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 32.ogg Dainsleif: ...
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 33.ogg Dainsleif: I'll take that 500 Mora... and now I also understand your views on this world. As we agreed, you may now commission me.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 34.ogg Dainsleif: That said, I only take commissions related to the Abyss Order.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 35.ogg Dainsleif: Like you, I am currently on a journey. You intend to find your sibling, while I wish to oppose the Abyss.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 36.ogg Dainsleif: Ugh... Those creatures that serve the Abyss are the fangs and claws by which the Order spreads chaos in this world.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 37.ogg Dainsleif: I have come to Mondstadt this time while on the trail of an Abyss Herald...
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 38.ogg Dainsleif: An even more twisted Abyssal being, one that commands the Abyss Mages.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 39.ogg Dainsleif: There's some reason behind that, I'm afraid.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 40.ogg Dainsleif: It's possible that they may have been under orders to avoid your path.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 41a.ogg Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 41b.ogg Dainsleif: (That manner... it's just like (hers/his).)
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 42.ogg Dainsleif: Well then, let's go see for ourselves, shall we? According to the leads I have on hand, the Abyss Order has re-infiltrated the Temple of the Falcon.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 dainsleif 43.ogg Dainsleif: Let's meet up at the temple. Perhaps your questions about the Abyss will be answered there.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow, he's got no intention of paying us any mind, huh...
Media:vo wqdy001 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So... guess we've broken the ice... What a weird guy.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 paimon 03a.ogg Paimon: That's not true, and you know it!
Media:vo wqdy001 6 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: Uh-huh, we're the best of friends!
Media:vo wqdy001 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: (And he was so cold just a moment before... Paimon's got a baaaad feeling about this!)
Media:vo wqdy001 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Well, now Paimon's got a really bad feeling. That kind of compensation can't be right...
Media:vo wqdy001 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: An Abyss Herald?
Media:vo wqdy001 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Ooh, that's right! We've just been fighting against the Fatui in Liyue, who are human too...
Media:vo wqdy001 6 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: We haven't encountered the non-human Abyss Order at all.
Media:vo wqdy001 6 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: That does sound pretty dangerous... Maybe they're looking for a better time to ambush us or something...
Media:vo wqdy001 6 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Uh-huh! We're super-duper strong!
