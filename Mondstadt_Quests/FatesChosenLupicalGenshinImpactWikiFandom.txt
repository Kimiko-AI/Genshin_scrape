 "The red one, burny girl..."
 Cheer up...
 Quest DescriptionYou are yet again led to Wolvendom. Are these Wolfhook seeds solid evidence? Are Razor and his wolf pack really behind the attack? Or are the Wolfhooks indicative of something else?
 Razor...
 That wasn't Amber?
Media:vo dialog rzlq004 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Traveler, go and find some Wolfhooks. I need to talk with Razor.
Media:vo dialog rzlq004 razor 01.ogg Razor: Looks like this. Can be used to stop bleeding.
Media:vo rzlq004 10 ambor 01.ogg Amber: It's true. Wolfhook seeds have a liquid coating that not only functions as a mild painkiller, but also has a hemostatic effect...
Media:vo rzlq004 10 ambor 02.ogg Amber: ...I read that in a book.
Media:vo rzlq004 10 ambor 03.ogg Amber: ...I have no idea.
Media:vo rzlq004 10 ambor 04.ogg Amber: Right. And if that lot does come back, I doubt they will try their luck against a member of the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo rzlq004 10 ambor 05.ogg Amber: Your wolf friend is not clear of my suspicion just yet. But (Traveler), we'll still need you to fetch those seeds.
Media:vo rzlq004 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Where are we?
Media:vo rzlq004 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Aren't those wolfhook seeds?
Media:vo rzlq004 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Why?
Media:vo rzlq004 10 razor 01.ogg Razor: (Traveler), help me. Collect these.
Media:vo rzlq004 10 razor 02.ogg Razor: Crush them. Put on wound. Bleeding stop.
Media:vo rzlq004 10 razor 03.ogg Razor: Hooks help seeds move. Liquid stops pain and bleeding.
Media:vo rzlq004 10 razor 04.ogg Razor: Animal doesn't feel hooks, they take seeds far away.
Media:vo rzlq004 10 razor 05.ogg Razor: ...Purple teacher told me so.
Media:vo rzlq004 10 razor 06.ogg Razor: I stay here, take care of this one. I answer red girl's questions.
Media:vo rzlq004 12 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Razor was just telling me about the wolven code of conduct. Mind-blowing stuff.
Media:vo rzlq004 12 ambor 02.ogg Amber: Enough!
Media:vo rzlq004 12 hopkinsthemarvelous 01.ogg Hopkins the Marvelous: We've looked everywhere and haven't seen any other wolves.
Media:vo rzlq004 12 hopkinsthemarvelous 02.ogg Hopkins the Marvelous: Wh—What are you doing here?
Media:vo rzlq004 12 hopkinsthemarvelous 03.ogg Hopkins the Marvelous: Huh!?
Media:vo rzlq004 12 hopkinsthemarvelous 04.ogg Hopkins the Marvelous: So, it was you. I should have known wolves aren't smart enough to be behind this.
Media:vo rzlq004 12 hopkinsthemarvelous 05.ogg Hopkins the Marvelous: I can't believe you would help wolves plot against humans!
Media:vo rzlq004 12 hopkinsthemarvelous 06.ogg Hopkins the Marvelous: They throw you some scraps and you treat them like kin? Have you forgotten what you are?
Media:vo rzlq004 12 jotun 01.ogg Jotun: Yep, that's wolves for you. The one we managed to capture must have been sick or something.
Media:vo rzlq004 12 jotun 02.ogg Jotun: It's him! The one who was raised by wolves!
Media:vo rzlq004 12 jotun 03.ogg Jotun: The Knights of Favonius are gonna let this guy off!?
Media:vo rzlq004 12 lupiboreas 01.ogg ???: What is this disturbance to which I awaken?
Media:vo rzlq004 12 lupiboreas 02.ogg ???: This is no offering to Boreas...
Media:vo rzlq004 12 lupiboreas 03.ogg ???: Not only do you come for my kind, so too do you fail to recognize your own transgression...
Media:vo rzlq004 12 lupiboreas 04.ogg ???: I will not stand for such impertinence!
Media:vo rzlq004 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We're back! Have we got enough?
Media:vo rzlq004 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yeah! You can't talk about Razor like that!
Media:vo rzlq004 12 razor 01.ogg Razor: Yes. Enough.
Media:vo rzlq004 12 razor 02.ogg Razor: Thank you.
Media:vo rzlq004 12 razor 03.ogg Razor: Revenge.
Media:vo rzlq004 12 razor 04.ogg Razor: We. Did. Not. Raid. Village.
Media:vo rzlq004 13 lupiboreas 01.ogg Wolf of the North: You seek to protect these outsiders, Razor?
Media:vo rzlq004 13 lupiboreas 02.ogg Wolf of the North: You cannot tame my fury.
Media:vo rzlq004 13 lupiboreas 03.ogg Wolf of the North: You must clear their name with your sword.
Media:vo rzlq004 13 lupiboreas 04.ogg Wolf of the North: Show me what your humans have taught you. Bare your claws of steel.
Media:vo rzlq004 13 razor 01.ogg Razor: Please! Calm!
Media:vo rzlq004 14 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Hey... Razor, what's that look for? Why don't you come to the city for a few days?
Media:vo rzlq004 14 ambor 02.ogg Amber: You're not safe in the wild anymore. But I know that you don't wanna hurt them.
Media:vo rzlq004 14 ambor 03.ogg Amber: Hey!? We've been with you all this time, and you still don't even know my name!?
Media:vo rzlq004 14 lupiboreas 01.ogg Boreas: Hmph...
Media:vo rzlq004 14 lupiboreas 02.ogg Boreas: It's just like he said. An outside wolf pack coming in and breaking the rules. They will reap what they have sown.
Media:vo rzlq004 14 lupiboreas 03.ogg Boreas: But Razor — you must not get involved. This is for the wolves to settle between themselves.
Media:vo rzlq004 14 lupiboreas 04.ogg Boreas: You fight not with claws, but with the sword. You strike not with teeth, but with lightning...
Media:vo rzlq004 14 lupiboreas 05.ogg Boreas: You are human, Razor.
Media:vo rzlq004 14 lupiboreas 06.ogg Boreas: You are no wolf. This is a matter for the wolves, and the wolves alone.
Media:vo rzlq004 14 lupiboreas 07.ogg Boreas: And you, you are Razor's Lupical amongst humans. Your nobility stands out against others of your kind.
Media:vo rzlq004 14 lupiboreas 08.ogg Boreas: If you ever wish, you may train with me.
Media:vo rzlq004 14 lupiboreas 09.ogg Boreas: I have nothing further to say. May we meet again, Razor, and company...
Media:vo rzlq004 14 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yeah! You have a friend in Mondstadt anyway right?
Media:vo rzlq004 14 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Y'know... that red, burny friend of yours?
Media:vo rzlq004 14 razor 01.ogg Razor: Please. Calm down.
Media:vo rzlq004 14 razor 02.ogg Razor: I am not like them! I don't belong.
Media:vo rzlq004 14 razor 03.ogg Razor: I'm fine. Don't worry. But I'm not city human...
Media:vo rzlq004 14 razor 04.ogg Razor: But also not wolf...
Media:vo rzlq004 14 razor 05.ogg Razor: Thank you. (Traveler), Paimon and... other red girl.
Media:vo rzlq004 14 razor 06.ogg Razor: Goodbye.
Media:vo rzlq004 2 ambor 01.ogg Amber: This is starting to make sense. Is this the wolf boy you were talking about?
Media:vo rzlq004 2 ambor 02.ogg Amber: With what?
Media:vo rzlq004 2 ambor 03.ogg Amber: I understand. But first, I have a few questions—
Media:vo rzlq004 2 ambor 04.ogg Amber: Blood? I hope the wolves didn't attack those idiots...
Media:vo rzlq004 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Chill out Razor, it's only us.
Media:vo rzlq004 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: ...So you don't know each other after all?
Media:vo rzlq004 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Correct! His name is Razor.
Media:vo rzlq004 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Those guys from earlier?
Media:vo rzlq004 2 razor 01.ogg Razor: Who's there?
Media:vo rzlq004 2 razor 02.ogg Razor: You... are also knight?
Media:vo rzlq004 2 razor 03.ogg Razor: No. This girl is also red, but no so burny like other girl.
Media:vo rzlq004 2 razor 04.ogg Razor: Help me out.
Media:vo rzlq004 2 razor 05.ogg Razor: No time. I sent Lupical away. People coming, bad people.
Media:vo rzlq004 2 razor 06.ogg Razor: *sniff* I smell blood. Quick.
Media:vo rzlq004 4 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Blood droplets!
Media:vo rzlq004 4 ambor 02.ogg Amber: That's strange, where does the word come from? Surely it wasn't made up by the wolves?
Media:vo rzlq004 4 ambor 03.ogg Amber: ...Who's "he"?
Media:vo rzlq004 4 ambor 04.ogg Amber: Hey, wait! This is your chance to prove your innocence!
Media:vo rzlq004 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Loopy what now? Are you gonna tell us what it means yet?
Media:vo rzlq004 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Sounds like gibberish to me.
Media:vo rzlq004 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wouldn't that be Barbatos though? He is the ruler of Mondstadt.
Media:vo rzlq004 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: He's already gone!
Media:vo rzlq004 4 razor 01.ogg Razor: Not human blood, wolf blood. Lupical blood...
Media:vo rzlq004 4 razor 02.ogg Razor: Lupical is family fate gave me. When wolf accepts human as its own. Or human accepts wolf. That is Lupical.
Media:vo rzlq004 4 razor 03.ogg Razor: It's just the name he gave.
Media:vo rzlq004 4 razor 04.ogg Razor: Guardian of this land.
Media:vo rzlq004 4 razor 05.ogg Razor: Enough. Another clue. Follow me.
Media:vo rzlq004 6 ambor 01.ogg Amber: I do agree that it's awful. But that doesn't change the fact that—
Media:vo rzlq004 6 ambor 02.ogg Amber: That's now the second time you've brought that up. Tell us who that is.
Media:vo rzlq004 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: How terrible...
Media:vo rzlq004 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whose code?
Media:vo rzlq004 6 razor 01.ogg Razor: This is him. We find his blood. Bad men did this.
Media:vo rzlq004 6 razor 02.ogg Razor: We didn't attack village! Not us!
Media:vo rzlq004 6 razor 03.ogg Razor: A black wolf and his pack, not from here. They try to take over land. They broke the code.
Media:vo rzlq004 6 razor 04.ogg Razor: Guardian of this land.
Media:vo rzlq004 6 razor 05.ogg Razor: I take Lupical further in. Follow me, maybe you see.
Media:vo rzlq004 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What's this?
Media:vo rzlq004 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: They're sooo huge...
Media:vo rzlq004 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa, if that one from earlier was two meters high...
Media:vo rzlq004 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Imagine how high this one must be.
Media:vo rzlq004 cs razor 01.ogg Razor: Please! Calm!
