 ...
 A flash of fire... a Vision, perhaps?
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 11a.ogg Donna: Who knows? Now that you mention it, a Pyro Vision does seem like a good explanation.
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 11a 1.ogg Donna: It lit up the whole area in an instant. I remember that very well.
 Ahem! *cough*
 Argh!
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 07b.ogg Charles: Hey. Look, do you want to hear the story or not?
Media:vo dlclq001 1 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: Wha—What did the bartender just say?
 Became his sidekick?
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 11b.ogg Lawrence: Heh... I would probably have just gotten in the way as far as the Darknight Hero is concerned.
 Diluc!? YOU are the Darknight Hero?
 Do you have any information regarding the "Darknight Hero"...
 Familiar? Could it be someone you know?
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 11b.ogg Donna: Hmm... That I really do not know.
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 11b 1.ogg Donna: Perhaps it was... fate?
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 11b 2.ogg Donna: You know? When you meet someone and it feels like... like you've known them your whole life?
 Has anyone ever seen him?
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 13a.ogg Charles: I'm told that there have been a handful of sightings. But in the depths of night, no one can get a good look at him.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 13a 1.ogg Charles: Perhaps that's why he only appears at night.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 13a 2.ogg Charles: Nevertheless, the sightings confirm that the Darknight Hero is more than just a groundless rumor.
 Have you been dealing with them alone the whole time?
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 10a.ogg Diluc: I assume so, unless you're aware of any other "Darknight Heroes" around these parts.
 Heard anything about a "Darknight Hero"?
 I'm trying to find out about the "Darknight Hero."
 It seems you have history with the Knights.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 13b.ogg Diluc: What's past is past. I would prefer not to discuss it.
 Just as I thought — it was you all along!
Media:vo dlclq001 2 margaret 03b.ogg Margaret: ...I'm joking. Don't take everything so seriously.
 Paimon, he literally just said it's NOT a scary story.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 paimon 03a.ogg Paimon: Huh? Did the bartender just say something?
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 07a.ogg Charles: You weren't even listening?
 Pie?
 Quest DescriptionRecently, rumors about a certain Darknight Hero have been circulating around Mondstadt...
 Ran away?
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 11a.ogg Lawrence: I wasn't the bad guy! Why would I need to run away?
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 11a 1.ogg Lawrence: ...Still, I did leave the scene. I didn't want to be a nuisance to the Darknight Hero.
 Shut it, Paimon!
 So this is a job for the mighty Diluc then.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 13a.ogg Diluc: *sigh* That's not my point. I am not doing this to impress anyone.
 So... you just wanted to flaunt your wealth.
 Sorry...
 The Darknight Hero! I knew it was you all along!
 Well...
 What do you know of the "Darknight Hero"?
 Why don't you get the Knights of Favonius to help?
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 10b.ogg Diluc: Hmph. Who would be helping whom is debatable.
 Why would he hide his identity?
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 13b.ogg Charles: I doubt anyone knows but him.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 13b 1.ogg Charles: Maybe he enjoys being a man of mystery.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 13b 2.ogg Charles: After all, it's a good way to get the ladies' attention.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 13b 3.ogg Charles: Any guy in the tavern could tell you that.
 You think the Darknight Hero might be one of the Knights?
 You're kidding, right?
Media:vo dlclq001 2 margaret 03a.ogg Margaret: *giggle* You're right, I'm not. I was joking.
???: *footsteps*
Anna: Darknight H– *achoo* Hero? Sorry, I've never heard of him.
Anna: My health is poor, *cough* I don't go out at night.
Beatrice: But I can't seem to recall much more than simply having heard the name. Sorry.
Beatrice: Hmm... That name does seem to ring a bell...
Blanche: Certainly not one of our customers, anyway.
Blanche: Darknight Hero? Doesn't ring a bell.
Eury: Is that from a fairytale, or a novel or something?
Flora: Huh? What's the Darknight Hero?
Flora: Is it a fairytale?
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 01.ogg Charles: So you've got a taste for adventure too, huh?
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 02.ogg Charles: I must say, the patrons have been in a bit of a buzz lately.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 03.ogg Charles: Though the topic on everyone's lips is more of an urban legend than actual news.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 04.ogg Charles: Even minding my own business I still end up hearing all about it.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 05.ogg Charles: Hahaha, it's not a particularly scary story, no... At least, not for most people...
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 06.ogg Charles: It's the tale of... the Darknight Hero!
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 07a.ogg Charles: You weren't even listening?
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 07b.ogg Charles: Hey. Look, do you want to hear the story or not?
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 08.ogg Charles: Anyway, the Darknight Hero.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 09.ogg Charles: It is said that he appears in the middle of the night to fight evil and uphold justice.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 10.ogg Charles: But to be honest, I don't have much interest in such rumors.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 11.ogg Charles: Unless of course he can help take care of the more belligerent patrons after they've had a few too many...
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 12.ogg Charles: I would happily take that as proof of his existence.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 13a 1.ogg Charles: Perhaps that's why he only appears at night.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 13a 2.ogg Charles: Nevertheless, the sightings confirm that the Darknight Hero is more than just a groundless rumor.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 13a.ogg Charles: I'm told that there have been a handful of sightings. But in the depths of night, no one can get a good look at him.

Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 13b.ogg Charles: I doubt anyone knows but him.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 14.ogg Charles: Hehe, anyway... That's more or less everything I know.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 charles 15.ogg Charles: If you want to know more, ask around in the plaza. Ah, I need to serve some customers.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh... It's not one of those scary urban legends, is it?
Media:vo dlclq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: If so, Paimon needs to take a deep breath first!
Media:vo dlclq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Argh!!!
Media:vo dlclq001 1 paimon 03a.ogg Paimon: Huh? Did the bartender just say something?
Media:vo dlclq001 1 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: Wha—What did the bartender just say?
Media:vo dlclq001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: "Darknight Hero"... seems like your standard cookie-cutter urban legend.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: But just a little darker.
Media:vo dlclq001 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Wonder who it could be. Once you're ready, let's head out to the plaza and ask around!
Media:vo dlclq001 2 margaret 01.ogg Margaret: You want to find out about the Darknight Hero?
Media:vo dlclq001 2 margaret 02.ogg Margaret: Look no further. It's me! I am the Darknight Hero.
Media:vo dlclq001 2 margaret 03a.ogg Margaret: *giggle* You're right, I'm not. I was joking.
Media:vo dlclq001 2 margaret 03b.ogg Margaret: ...I'm joking. Don't take everything so seriously.
Media:vo dlclq001 2 margaret 04.ogg Margaret: Heh. Jokes aside, I do think that the Darknight Hero and I have one thing in common.
Media:vo dlclq001 2 margaret 05.ogg Margaret: It's... the way he sticks to his principles... coming out here night after night, fighting for justice, keeping Mondstadt safe...
Media:vo dlclq001 2 margaret 06.ogg Margaret: N—No, I just mean, he must be seriously rich.
Media:vo dlclq001 2 margaret 07.ogg Margaret: People only start worrying about spiritual fulfillment once they have enough material wealth.
Media:vo dlclq001 2 margaret 08.ogg Margaret: It's the same in every hero story, isn't it?
Media:vo dlclq001 2 margaret 09.ogg Margaret: Heh. No, it's nothing like that. I just have too much time on my hands these days.
Media:vo dlclq001 2 margaret 10.ogg Margaret: Why don't you ask the guards at the city gate?
Media:vo dlclq001 2 margaret 11.ogg Margaret: They do night shifts all the time, they must know something.
Media:vo dlclq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Heh...
Media:vo dlclq001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What's that?
Media:vo dlclq001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wow, so you're a nocturnal vigilante too?
Media:vo dlclq001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Why is that?
Media:vo dlclq001 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Same difference, you are the boss of the Cat Tail after all...
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 01.ogg Lawrence: You want to know about... him?
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 02.ogg Lawrence: In fact, I'm one of the few who has seen him with my own two eyes.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 03.ogg Lawrence: Whoa— S—Slow down, let me start from the beginning.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 04.ogg Lawrence: Well, I was patrolling one night, when suddenly I heard something. I rushed over to check it out.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 05.ogg Lawrence: I saw a gang of suspicious looking fellows who looked like they were up to no good.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 06.ogg Lawrence: So I quickly hid.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 07.ogg Lawrence: That was when... he appeared.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 08.ogg Lawrence: He was dressed in black from head to toe, perfectly hidden in the night.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 09.ogg Lawrence: The way he crept up on those bad guys, it must have felt like a living nightmare.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 10.ogg Lawrence: Guess what I did next?
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 11a 1.ogg Lawrence: ...Still, I did leave the scene. I didn't want to be a nuisance to the Darknight Hero.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 11a.ogg Lawrence: I wasn't the bad guy! Why would I need to run away?
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 11b.ogg Lawrence: Heh... I would probably have just gotten in the way as far as the Darknight Hero is concerned.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 12.ogg Lawrence: ...So instead, I headed to the Knights of Favonius' residence.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 13.ogg Lawrence: Correct. I thought, "Surely someone with such a strong sense of justice and who voluntarily protects Mondstadt is exactly the kind of person you'd find in the Knights of Favonius."
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 14.ogg Lawrence: *sigh* But it seems I was wrong.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 15.ogg Lawrence: I checked everywhere, and there were no signs of anyone having left the building.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 16.ogg Lawrence: Yes. But I just can't understand... Why would someone like that not want to join the Knights?
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 17.ogg Lawrence: I'm sure they would warmly welcome someone of his abilities.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 18.ogg Lawrence: Hey, don't be like that! At least by talking to me you've ruled out a few more people...
Media:vo dlclq001 3 lawrence 19.ogg Lawrence: Anyway, try asking at the Flower Shop. I heard a girl there's been talking about the time he rescued her.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Great! This is the guy we need to talk to.
Media:vo dlclq001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So... just who is the Darknight Hero?
Media:vo dlclq001 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hid? You're supposed to be a guard!
Media:vo dlclq001 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wow...
Media:vo dlclq001 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So you're saying whoever it is can't be from the Knights of Favonius after all?
Media:vo dlclq001 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: So the point you're trying to make is... You don't know who the Darknight Hero is either?
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 01.ogg Donna: What's wrong with me...
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 02.ogg Donna: Why can't I get him out of my mind...
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 03.ogg Donna: MY HERO! ...Oh, sorry! Just hearing his name gets me lost in thought... Hang on, how did you know who I was talking about?
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 04.ogg Donna: Is it that obvious?
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 05.ogg Donna: Oh no, what am I going to do...? If Master Diluc ever finds out—
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 06.ogg Donna: Ugh... Well, I guess I might as well spill the beans then.
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 07.ogg Donna: I used to think Diluc was the one for me.
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 08.ogg Donna: But ever since the time I was rescued by the Darknight Hero... I—I just don't know anymore...
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 09.ogg Donna: It all happened so fast... I was so scared...
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 10.ogg Donna: All I remember is seeing a flash of fire... but I felt safe. I only saw his silhouette but it felt so... familiar.
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 11a 1.ogg Donna: It lit up the whole area in an instant. I remember that very well.
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 11a.ogg Donna: Who knows? Now that you mention it, a Pyro Vision does seem like a good explanation.
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 11b 1.ogg Donna: Perhaps it was... fate?
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 11b 2.ogg Donna: You know? When you meet someone and it feels like... like you've known them your whole life?
Media:vo dlclq001 4 donna 11b.ogg Donna: Hmm... That I really do not know.
Media:vo dlclq001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ah, hello? We'd like to ask you about the Darknight Hero—
Media:vo dlclq001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? What's Diluc got to do with this?
Media:vo dlclq001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wowee, you saw the Darknight Hero? For real? What's he like?
Media:vo dlclq001 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oookay then! Well, thanks for the intel Donna. See you around!
Media:vo dlclq001 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So, based on what we know so far...
Media:vo dlclq001 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: All we need to find is a wealthy, Vision-wielding vigilante who is not one of the Knights.
Media:vo dlclq001 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Nope, still no idea.
Media:vo dlclq001 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: But we already asked so many people. Guess we got to see for ourselves.
Media:vo dlclq001 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Let's take a look around the city at nighttime — if we're lucky, we just might bump into him.
Media:vo dlclq001 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's getting dark. Let's stick around Mondstadt. Maybe if we're lucky we'll meet the Darknight Hero.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: After managing to steer clear of the guards' patrol route... I never anticipated I'd run into you instead.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: "Darknight Hero"...? Sounds awfully derivative to me. Please tell me you didn't come up with that.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: I do not concern myself with idle chatter... Though, I suppose I may take the idleness of others as a sign that peace prevails.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: Please, stop calling me that. Seriously, it makes me uncomfortable.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: Pie?
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: ...
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 07.ogg Diluc: It was the Abyss Order.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 08.ogg Diluc: I don't know what the devil they're plotting this time. It seems they're performing some initial reconnaissance.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 09.ogg Diluc: Considering that I've proven myself to be one step ahead of them on countless occasions, their persistence is... unusual.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 10a.ogg Diluc: I assume so, unless you're aware of any other "Darknight Heroes" around these parts.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 10b.ogg Diluc: Hmph. Who would be helping whom is debatable.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 11.ogg Diluc: The Knights are, for the most part, an utterly incompetent bunch.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 12.ogg Diluc: I cannot trust them to take this matter over.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 13a.ogg Diluc: *sigh* That's not my point. I am not doing this to impress anyone.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 13b.ogg Diluc: What's past is past. I would prefer not to discuss it.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 14.ogg Diluc: Well, I hope this conversation has been of service to you — because I would like to ask for a favor in return.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 15.ogg Diluc: You must keep my identity a secret.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 16.ogg Diluc: Above all, it is crucial that you do not let the Knights of Favonius know I am connected to any of this.
(A bunch of hilichurls approach the city)
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 17.ogg Diluc: They appear to just be small-timers. You should have no trouble dealing with them.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 18.ogg Diluc: I cannot afford delays on account of a few lackeys. I shall have to let you take care of them.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 diluc 19.ogg Diluc: Remember — don't tell a soul!
(Diluc leaves you with the hilichurls)
Media:vo dlclq001 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: How is this the first you've heard of the name? Every man and his dog in Mondstadt is yapping about the Darknight Hero!
Media:vo dlclq001 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huzzah! The Great Mystery of the Darknight Hero of Mondstadt... We solved it!
Media:vo dlclq001 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Now then, Mr. Darknight Hero—
Media:vo dlclq001 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hah, not surprised. It's the stupidest superhero name Paimon's ever heard. You should come up with something more original.
Media:vo dlclq001 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Like...
Media:vo dlclq001 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Emm... "Captain Pie..."
Media:vo dlclq001 7 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Captain Pyro!
Media:vo dlclq001 7 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Tell us Captain Pyro, what happened here today?
Media:vo dlclq001 7 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Them again?
Media:vo dlclq001 7 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Ooh, what is it Master Diluc? Your wish is our command~
Media:vo dlclq001 7 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: What's that sound? Yikes, have the Abyss Order sent backup already?
Media:vo dlclq001 7 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Hey! You're just gonna leave us like this!?
Media:vo dlclq001 9 huffman 01.ogg Huffman: Greetings. I thought I heard something, so I came to check it out.
Media:vo dlclq001 9 huffman 02.ogg Huffman: Did you see anything out of the ordinary?
Media:vo dlclq001 9 huffman 03.ogg Huffman: The Darknight Hero? You saw him?
Media:vo dlclq001 9 huffman 04.ogg Huffman: You! The hero who safeguards Mondstadt from the shadows! On behalf of the Knights of Favonius, I thank you for your service to this city!
Media:vo dlclq001 9 huffman 05.ogg Huffman: Wait a second... Aren't you the Traveler that just arrived in the city?
Media:vo dlclq001 9 huffman 06.ogg Huffman: Rumors were circulating about the Darknight Hero long before you ever arrived here.
Media:vo dlclq001 9 huffman 07.ogg Huffman: ...Why would you lie to me about that?
Media:vo dlclq001 9 huffman 08.ogg Huffman: Hmm. Never mind, you don't seem like bad folks.
Media:vo dlclq001 9 huffman 09.ogg Huffman: But I do hope you will visit the Knights of Favonius soon, where we can discuss the Darknight Hero situation in more detail.
Media:vo dlclq001 9 huffman 10.ogg Huffman: Some things are best not discussed in public.
Media:vo dlclq001 9 huffman 11.ogg Huffman: Duty calls. I must be going. Stay safe, Traveler!
(After Huffman leaves)
Media:vo dlclq001 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Nope. Nuh-huh. Not here. Nothing. Zilch.
Media:vo dlclq001 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: ...Unless you're looking for the Darknight Hero, in which case—
Media:vo dlclq001 9 paimon 03a.ogg Media:vo dlclq001 9 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: Oh, ahh... The Darknight Hero, is ahh... (him/her)!
Media:vo dlclq001 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Heh... it's nothing, really... you're too kind...
Media:vo dlclq001 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh... Ah...
Media:vo dlclq001 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Seems like Huffman has something he really wants to say to you about the Darknight Hero.
Media:vo dlclq001 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Better head over to the Knights of Favonius and see if you can find him.
Media:vo dlclq001 cs paimon 01.ogg Paimon: The Darknight Hero is Master Diluc!?
Nimrod: I've heard the name... I think. I'm not sure. Sorry.
Norma: Never heard of him. Sorry, maybe someone else knows something.
Quinn: Darknight Hero? Definitely heard him mentioned, yep. Nothing specific though.
Sara: But I don't tend to listen in on their conversations, so I'm afraid I know nothing.
Sara: I think I've heard customers talk about that.
Swan: I haven't heard a thing... *sigh* I'm really out of the loop.
