 Excuse me then.
 I'll check them out in a moment...
 I'll have a look.
 Quest DescriptionDuring the Windblume Festival, the area around Mondstadt will play host to all sorts of interesting activities. The Knights of Favonius' Lizzie would like to introduce you to one of the highlights of this event — "Floral Freefall."
 Seems that you'd be more into that than me.
 Sounds like something I'd enjoy.
 They're not as fun as I imagined.
 They're not bad.
Lizzie: Haha, if it weren't for my duties as a hostess, I'd be on my merry way there.
Lizzie: Hahaha, you might as well try a brand-new event that I'm promoting now — "Floral Freefall"!
Lizzie: Have fun!
Lizzie: Hey there! Have you tried any of the events that I recommended?
Lizzie: Jump down from way up high and float through the air, screaming at the top of your lungs — YAHOO~!
Lizzie: Just like before, if your score is high enough, you can claim a reward.
Lizzie: Sure, go try it out! When our future events begin, I will introduce them to you as well.
Lizzie: This event is really thrilling! If you're into adventuring, it's sure to be something right up your alley!
