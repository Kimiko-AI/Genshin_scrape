 Quest DescriptionYou came to Stormterror's Lair to once again attempt Dvalin's rescue. However, it is surrounded by wind barriers made by Stormterror, and the dark forces at work have no intention of letting you break through those barriers so easily.
(After defeating the hilichurls)
Media:vo mdaq065 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's a storm barrier!
Media:vo mdaq065 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It looks so dangerous...
Media:vo mdaq065 2 qin 01.ogg Jean: Enemy attack! Prepare yourselves!
Media:vo mdaq065 2 venti 01.ogg Venti: Let me at it.
Media:vo mdaq065 2 venti 02.ogg Venti: Although this wooden lyre is all I have...
Media:vo mdaq065 2 venti 03.ogg Venti: I don't need the lyre to break through this kind of storm barriâ€” Ah, wait, what is that?
(A group of hilichurls appears)
Media:vo mdaq065 3 qin 01.ogg Jean: Wait. What's going on? Something's not right.
Media:vo mdaq065 3 qin 02.ogg Jean: There shouldn't be any hilichurl camps in the vicinity of Stormterror's Lair...
Media:vo mdaq065 3 venti 01.ogg Venti: The stage will need to be cleared before I can begin my performance.
Media:vo mdaq065 3 venti 02.ogg Venti: Generally speaking such chores are not the concerns of the performer himself...
Media:vo mdaq065 4 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: The Abyss Order must be manipulating them behind the scenes, yet they shouldn't have been able to determine that we would come.
Media:vo mdaq065 4 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: They're presumably spreading their forces to halt our plans.
Media:vo mdaq065 4 venti 01.ogg Venti: Ahh...
Media:vo mdaq065 4 venti 02.ogg Venti: The hilichurls usually do not venture into areas with high elemental concentrations.
Media:vo mdaq065 4 venti 03.ogg Venti: It puts a heavy burden on their bodies.
Media:vo mdaq065 4 venti 04.ogg Venti: Without further ado...
Media:vo mdaq065 4 venti 05.ogg Venti: I suppose I can play faster if my only audience is the wind.
(Venti disperses the wind barrier by playing the lyre)
Media:vo mdaq066 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It actually opened! You're not entirely useless, Tone-Deaf Bard!
Media:vo mdaq066 5 qin 01.ogg Jean: This is it. We are now entering Stormterror's Lair.
Media:vo mdaq066 5 qin 02.ogg Jean: Watch yourselves. Let's move.
