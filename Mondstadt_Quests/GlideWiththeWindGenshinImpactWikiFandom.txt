 ...Maybe you can cut me some slack?
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 10.ogg Amber: No with a capital N-O! Do not challenge the authority of examiner Amber!
 I keep getting carried away and gliding too high.
 It reads like a fairytale...
 It's fine. I can do this.
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 11.ogg Amber: I'm sure (Traveler) will glide through it!
 People in Mondstadt really understand the romance in learning to glide.
 Pretty good.
 Quest DescriptionAmber wishes to discuss the matter of how you've been using your Wind Glider...
 Well, guess I'd better get started.
"How can we reach the heavens?"
"It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world"
"We understand now! All we needed was a stronger wind to fly"
"What you lacked was not wind, but courage"
"You have yet to find that which is most important"
After Amber leaves, you begin to read the Gliding Instruction Manual with Paimon:
When the first wisp of wind brushed across the land
Birds that yearned for the sky had wings
But no way to fly
They asked the Anemo God:
"How can we reach the heavens?"
To which the Anemo God replied:
"You have yet to find that which is most important"
As the God spoke, the wind thrust the seeds of a dandelion
High into the sky
The birds thrust out their wings
But the breeze was all too mild
Leaving them to stumble across the earth
So they went to the gorge
Where the wind showed off its wild and incomparable strength
They threw themselves off the cliff
And flapped their wings amongst the howling winds
Until they were able to fly freely in the sky
To the Anemo God they went, to gleefully say:
"We understand now! All we needed was a stronger wind to fly"
In reply the Anemo God said:
"What you lacked was not wind, but courage"
"It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world"
And flapped their wings amongst the howling winds
As the God spoke, the wind thrust the seeds of a dandelion
Birds that yearned for the sky had wings
But no way to fly
But the breeze was all too mild
High into the sky
In reply the Anemo God said:
Leaving them to stumble across the earth
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Hey (Traveler)! I've been looking for you everywhere! How's that wind glider I gave you last time?
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 02.ogg Amber: Seems like it's really growing on you!
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 03.ogg Amber: But then again, you don't have a gliding license, do you?
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 04.ogg Amber: Isn't it obvious? You gotta have a gliding license to legally glide in Mondstadt.
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 05.ogg Amber: Yeah, you've been gliding all over the place... Everyone's noticed!
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 06.ogg Amber: No way! The Knights of Favonius have strict rules.
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 07.ogg Amber: You need to pass an exam, and only then will the Knights issue your license.
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 08.ogg Amber: Today I'm here as an examiner, to oversee (Traveler)'s official gliding exam!
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 09.ogg Amber: I gave you your wind glider, so this is my responsibility â€” at least, that's what Acting Grand Master Jean would say.
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 10.ogg Amber: No with a capital N-O! Do not challenge the authority of examiner Amber!
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 11.ogg Amber: I'm sure (Traveler) will glide through it!
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 12.ogg Amber: I mean... The whole city saw how well you flew the day that Stormterror attacked, so I'm sure you'll have no problems!
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 13.ogg Amber: But we do need to respect the rules and glide properly.
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 14.ogg Amber: Here. Take this gliding manual. No need to memorize it, just be familiar with everything in there.
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 15.ogg Amber: For example: only one person per wind glider, no carrying anything over the set weight limit, no taking off using an Anemo Slime, and so on and so forth.
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 16.ogg Amber: Anyway, be sure to read it, okay? I had to read a load of big, thick books too when Lisa was teaching me magic...
Media:vo ablq001 1 ambor 17.ogg Amber: Great. Come find me when you're done, I'll be at Windrise.
Media:vo ablq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: A gliding license? Hmm... What's that?
Media:vo ablq001 1 paimon 02a.ogg Paimon: Oh... but (Traveler) and Paimon have been gliding for ages now. This is the first we've heard about it!
Media:vo ablq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Eh-he.
Media:vo ablq001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Sooo... You came looking for us because you wanna give us a gliding license?
Media:vo ablq001 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: An exam! What a pain in the butt. Then again, since Amber is the examiner...
Media:vo ablq001 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Wow, that's a big old book... Paimon thinks we best get started!
Media:vo ablq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: *sigh* The Knights of Favonius gliding manual does NOT sound like a fun read...
Media:vo ablq001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm... That's a cool story... But is the Knights' gliding manual really written in that style?
Media:vo ablq001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh. Anyway, let's go find Amber.

You open the instruction manual expecting it to be a tedious chore, but to your surprise, you are met with a charming tale about baby birds learning to fly...
