 A cliff?
 Goodbye.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 diluc 02c.ogg Diluc: Nothing more? We'll meet at Starsnatch Cliff then.
 Goodbye.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 qin 02c.ogg Jean: May the wind guide us in saving Dvalin.
 Goodbye.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 venti 02c.ogg Venti: I should prepare to meet my old friend.
 In the sky? You could play the lyre as you're gliding through the air...
Media:vo mdaq061 4 qin 06c.ogg Jean: Even Amber would never think of doing such a thing...
 Let me give it a try...
(The player is prompted to drop the tears onto the Partially Repaired Holy Lyre der Himmel)
 Near the sea?
 Quest DescriptionAfter completing the retrieval of the tears, you meet up with the rest of the group.
 Tell me about Angel's Share.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 diluc 02a 1.ogg Diluc: Some of Dawn Winery's wine is sold at Angel's Share, a local tavern.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 diluc 02a 2.ogg Diluc: I work the bar there sometimes. If you ever need to talk to me, feel free to find me there.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 diluc 02a 3.ogg Diluc: Otherwise, you might need to make an appointment with my butler.
 Tell me about Dvalin.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 venti 02a 1.ogg Venti: Dvalin used to be my friend... I still regard him as such.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 venti 02a 2.ogg Venti: We used to listen to the songs of the wind and sing Ode to the Dandelion together...
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 venti 02a 3.ogg Venti: That's why I remember him as someone gentle.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 venti 02a 4.ogg Venti: Huh? Of course, you're already my friend.
 Tell me about the Holy Lyre.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 qin 02b 1.ogg Jean: Barbatos' sacred relic, Mondstadt's treasure... The Holy Lyre.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 qin 02b 2.ogg Jean: No wonder it has the power to purify evil...
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 qin 02b 3.ogg Jean: I hope it will help us save Dvalin, like Venti says.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 qin 02b 4.ogg Jean: If it can, then it truly is a blessing bestowed upon us by Lord Barbatos.
 Tell me about the Knights.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 qin 02a 1.ogg Jean: The Knights of Favonius were all very busy dealing with the aftermath of the incident. I'm a bit ashamed of myself for it...
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 qin 02a 2.ogg Jean: If only I was a stronger leader...
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 qin 02a 3.ogg Jean: Or at least good enough to boost the morale and the strength of our troops like our Grand Master does...
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 qin 02a 4.ogg Jean: No, I cannot feel sorry for myself. We need to solve our problems first. Right?
 Tell me about wine.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 venti 02b 1.ogg Venti: Mondstadt is famous for its wine. It's the city's most prized treasure, I'd say.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 venti 02b 2.ogg Venti: Its dandelion wine is the best!
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 venti 02b 3.ogg Venti: Actually, the scent of dandelion in the wind alone is enough to get you drunk.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 venti 02b 4.ogg Venti: Ah, I almost forgot that you're underage. Such a shame...
 Why are you helping us?
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 diluc 02b 1.ogg Diluc: I mostly decided to do it on a whim. Though I must say, that bard is quite intriguing.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 diluc 02b 2.ogg Diluc: Besides, it's bad for my business if we keep letting Stormterror do whatever it pleases.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 diluc 02b 3.ogg Diluc: Let me be clear though. I did it for you, not for the Knights.
Jean: I know I'm not here on official business, so why did I sound so stern just now? It seems I struggle to break out of work mode.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Although we may be able to negotiate with Stormterror, we'll most likely have to fight. Please be ready for it.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 diluc 02a 1.ogg Diluc: Some of Dawn Winery's wine is sold at Angel's Share, a local tavern.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 diluc 02a 2.ogg Diluc: I work the bar there sometimes. If you ever need to talk to me, feel free to find me there.
Media:vo dialog mdaq061 diluc 02a 3.ogg Diluc: Otherwise, you might need to make an appointment with my butler.

Media:vo dialog mdaq061 venti 02c.ogg Venti: I should prepare to meet my old friend.
Media:vo mdaq060 2 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Interesting. It's like filtering wine. The process is... refreshing.
Media:vo mdaq060 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Woohoo!
Media:vo mdaq060 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Dvalin Protection Squad! Assemble!
Media:vo mdaq060 2 qin 01.ogg Jean: It is hard to believe such a thing is possible, until you've seen it with your own eyes.
Media:vo mdaq060 2 venti 01.ogg Venti: Let's put our crystals together.
Media:vo mdaq060 2 venti 02.ogg Venti: Oh...
Media:vo mdaq060 2 venti 03.ogg Venti: The color of these crystals looks... muddy.
Media:vo mdaq060 2 venti 04.ogg Venti: Dvalin... You're going through so much pain...
Media:vo mdaq060 2 venti 05.ogg Venti: ...Let's start purifying these crystals first. Please, (Traveler).
(The red Teardrop Crystals are restored to a green color)
Media:vo mdaq060 2 venti 06.ogg Venti: I think we should have enough tears now. So next we...
Media:vo mdaq060 2 venti 07.ogg Venti: Use the crystal on the Holy Lyre like last time.
Media:vo mdaq061 4 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: If the winery was destroyed, it's not something I couldn't eventually fix, but... I'd still rather not go through the hassle.
Media:vo mdaq061 4 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: If you go east from Starfell Lake, there are mountains south of the beach.
Media:vo mdaq061 4 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: If you head to where the cliff juts out â€” that place is known as Starsnatch Cliff.
Media:vo mdaq061 4 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: What do you think, bard? Meets the requirements, no?
Media:vo mdaq061 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It worked!
Media:vo mdaq061 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon understands. Sea or high places, right?
Media:vo mdaq061 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Then the best location to play the lyre would be...
Media:vo mdaq061 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: ..Oh! You mean that beach you were snoring away on and Paimon had to wake you?
Media:vo mdaq061 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hee-hee! Yes, Ma'am!
Media:vo mdaq061 4 qin 01.ogg Jean: It seems completely different from before.
Media:vo mdaq061 4 qin 02.ogg Jean: Now, where should we summon Stormterror?
Media:vo mdaq061 4 qin 03.ogg Jean: It must be away from the city, else there will be casualties should we fail.
Media:vo mdaq061 4 qin 04.ogg Jean: Perhaps here at the winery...
Media:vo mdaq061 4 qin 05.ogg Jean: ...
Media:vo mdaq061 4 qin 06c.ogg Jean: Even Amber would never think of doing such a thing...
Media:vo mdaq061 4 qin 07.ogg Jean: Very well. Then let's meet at Starsnatch Cliff when we are ready.
Media:vo mdaq061 4 qin 08.ogg Jean: Please don't be late.
Media:vo mdaq061 4 qin 09.ogg Jean: Ah, sorry. I didn't mean to...
(Obtain Completely Repaired Holy Lyre der Himmel, quest ends)
Media:vo mdaq061 4 venti 01.ogg Venti: The lyre's Anemo power seems fully restored. We should be able to use it now.
Media:vo mdaq061 4 venti 02.ogg Venti: It's all thanks to you, (Traveler).
Media:vo mdaq061 4 venti 03.ogg Venti: The wind that blows at sea or in high places should be able to carry a bard's words far away.
Media:vo mdaq061 4 venti 04.ogg Venti: It's never going to work if the air is too dry or suffocating.
Media:vo mdaq061 4 venti 05.ogg Venti: Lemme think... Starsnatch Cliff...
Media:vo mdaq061 4 venti 06.ogg Venti: ...Alright, let's do it there.
Venti: Great job, (Traveler). Now, look at what I can do!
