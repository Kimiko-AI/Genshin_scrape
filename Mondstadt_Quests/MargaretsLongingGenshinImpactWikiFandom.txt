Media:vo qinlq002 3 paimon 01c.ogg Paimon: Paimon thought Prince would be in the city.
Media:vo qinlq002 3 paimon 01c 1.ogg Paimon: If you got things you need to do, you can always come back and look later.

Media:vo qinlq002 4 paimon 01a.ogg Paimon: Hmm... His senses are keener than we thought! He can't have gone far though, why not track him with your Elemental Sight?
Media:vo qinlq002 4 paimon 01a 1.ogg Paimon: Next time, try creeping up from behind... quietly does it...
Media:vo qinlq002 4 paimon 01a 2.ogg Paimon: Or if you're feeling patient, use some fish as bait and catch him off guard.

Media:vo qinlq002 4 paimon 01c.ogg Paimon: Drat! He's run off again.
Media:vo qinlq002 4 paimon 01c 1.ogg Paimon: But where is he going? Hmm, Paimon wonders if...

Media:vo qinlq002 5 margaret 01a.ogg Margaret: Prince! Where did you go running off to? Thank goodness you're safe...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 paimon 01a.ogg Paimon: He made sure we had our work cut out for us looking for him.
Media:vo qinlq002 5 margaret 01a 1.ogg Margaret: Oh Princey, how could you leave me like that...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 paimon 01a 1.ogg Paimon: Looks like those two need some time to themselves...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 paimon 01a 2.ogg Paimon: And here are your astral iron strings, Venti.
Media:vo qinlq002 5 venti 01a.ogg Venti: You found them! Wonderful! I was not optimistic they would turn up.

Media:vo qinlq002 5 margaret 01b.ogg Margaret: Prince! Good boy, that's my Prince, I knew you'd come home to me...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 paimon 01b.ogg Paimon: *panting* Gah! After all that searching...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 margaret 01b 1.ogg Margaret: Oh Princey, how could you leave me like that...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 paimon 01b 1.ogg Paimon: Looks like those two need some time to themselves...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 venti 01b.ogg Venti: Look at you... Did Prince take you on a bit of a wild goose chase, then?
Media:vo qinlq002 5 venti 01b 1.ogg Venti: Heh... Cheer up, even if you didn't catch him, he's back here thanks to you.
Media:vo qinlq002 5 venti 01b 2.ogg Venti: And he still has the astral iron strings with him!
 Quest DescriptionWhile Jean is ill from overwork, you've been tasked with handling some citizens' commissions on her behalf. Where has Margaret's pet cat Prince run off to this time?
 Spoken just like a parent who chooses to spoil said rascal!
Media:vo dialog qinlq002 margaret 01.ogg Margaret: Prince should be somewhere around the Marketplace. Remember, he's got black fur.
Media:vo qinlq002 1 margaret 01.ogg Margaret: Haha, Prince is a mischievous little rascal alright!
Media:vo qinlq002 1 margaret 02.ogg Margaret: Everyone knows cats go crazy for a ball of string!
Media:vo qinlq002 1 margaret 03.ogg Margaret: Thank you all. Prince should be somewhere around the Marketplace. It's a black cat you're looking for.
Media:vo qinlq002 1 margaret 04.ogg Margaret: Oh— Take this fish, it's little Prince's favorite food. Maybe it will help you find him.
(Obtain Fish ×5)
Media:vo qinlq002 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Venti! Have you come to help?
Media:vo qinlq002 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: But Paimon just saw you talking to Margaret about Prince...
Media:vo qinlq002 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Indeed. Just like Barbatos...
Media:vo qinlq002 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: What would a kitty cat want with lyre strings anyway?
Media:vo qinlq002 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: What!?
Media:vo qinlq002 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: The strings contain Anemo energy?
Media:vo qinlq002 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: That'll help us! Traveler, it's time for you to use your Elemental Sight again!
Media:vo qinlq002 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Paimon's sure there must be some elemental footprints or something.
Media:vo qinlq002 1 venti 01.ogg Venti: ...So, yours is the cat that went missing.
Media:vo qinlq002 1 venti 02.ogg Venti: Me, here to help you? Why, on the contrary, it is I who needs helping!
Media:vo qinlq002 1 venti 03.ogg Venti: Aha! So, Prince is the name of the feline fiend who thieved my spare astral iron strings!
Media:vo qinlq002 1 venti 04.ogg Venti: Though it gladdens my heart to see that the free-spirited ethos of Mondstadt is alive and well in creatures great and small... Still, it's a bit audacious!
Media:vo qinlq002 1 venti 05.ogg Venti: Ahaha, yes, quite... quite... Ahem! Now, let's see about getting ourselves an audience with his little highness, Prince Rascal of Mondstadt!
Media:vo qinlq002 1 venti 06.ogg Venti: I have a performance tonight, and without my spare strings, I shall have to disappoint my audience.
Media:vo qinlq002 1 venti 07.ogg Venti: These lyre strings are made of astral iron, which contains Anemo energy. That makes them extremely durable, so I normally just roll them up in a ball to make them easier to carry.
Media:vo qinlq002 1 venti 08.ogg Venti: That's a trick of the trade from a traveling bard!
Media:vo qinlq002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, look! Over there... it looks just like the cat Margaret was describing.
Media:vo qinlq002 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So it must be Prince?
Media:vo qinlq002 3 margaret 01.ogg Margaret: Where have you been looking?
Media:vo qinlq002 3 margaret 02.ogg Margaret: Prince should be somewhere around the marketplace. Remember, he's got black fur.
Media:vo qinlq002 3 paimon 01a 1.ogg Paimon: See if you can approach him crouching from behind, that way your footsteps will be quieter.
Media:vo qinlq002 3 paimon 01a 2.ogg Paimon: It must be difficult not being able to float, hee-hee.
Media:vo qinlq002 3 paimon 01a 3.ogg Paimon: If you're anxious to find Prince, why not coax him to you with some Fish? Kitty cats do love eating fish.
Media:vo qinlq002 3 paimon 01a 4.ogg Paimon: If you've run out of Fish, go grab some more from the lake. Now, back to it!
Media:vo qinlq002 3 paimon 01a.ogg Paimon: Wow, Prince has very keen senses. It didn't take much to scare him off.
Media:vo qinlq002 3 paimon 01c 1.ogg Paimon: If you got things you need to do, you can always come back and look later.
Media:vo qinlq002 3 paimon 01c.ogg Paimon: Paimon thought Prince would be in the city.

Media:vo qinlq002 5 margaret 01a.ogg Margaret: Prince! Where did you go running off to? Thank goodness you're safe...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 margaret 01b 1.ogg Margaret: Oh Princey, how could you leave me like that...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 margaret 01b.ogg Margaret: Prince! Good boy, that's my Prince, I knew you'd come home to me...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 paimon 01a 1.ogg Paimon: Looks like those two need some time to themselves...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 paimon 01a 2.ogg Paimon: And here are your astral iron strings, Venti.
Media:vo qinlq002 5 paimon 01a 3.ogg Paimon: Ah what?
Media:vo qinlq002 5 paimon 01a 4.ogg Paimon: Oh, now Paimon gets why you didn't go looking for your strings by yourself...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 paimon 01a.ogg Paimon: He made sure we had our work cut out for us looking for him.
Media:vo qinlq002 5 paimon 01b 1.ogg Paimon: Looks like those two need some time to themselves...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 paimon 01b.ogg Paimon: *panting* Gah! After all that searching...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 venti 01a 1.ogg Venti: I daresay that a private performance played using these very same strings would not be an excessive way to show my gratitude! ...Ah, ah...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 venti 01a 2.ogg Venti: ACHOO!
Media:vo qinlq002 5 venti 01a 3.ogg Venti: *cough* Haha... Apologies. At this distance, my cat allergy seems to be rearing its head...
Media:vo qinlq002 5 venti 01a 4.ogg Venti: Hehe, anyway, thanks for the help, I'll be going now— a—achoo!
Media:vo qinlq002 5 venti 01a.ogg Venti: You found them! Wonderful! I was not optimistic they would turn up.
Media:vo qinlq002 5 venti 01b 1.ogg Venti: Heh... Cheer up, even if you didn't catch him, he's back here thanks to you.
Media:vo qinlq002 5 venti 01b 2.ogg Venti: And he still has the astral iron strings with him!
Media:vo qinlq002 5 venti 01b.ogg Venti: Look at you... Did Prince take you on a bit of a wild goose chase, then?
