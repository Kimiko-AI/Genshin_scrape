 And if I hadn't been there...?
 I'm watching you.
 No sudden moves.
 Quest DescriptionTo heal Uwe, you accompany Barbara to search the Whispering Woods for Small Lamp Grass.
 What if you'd been on your own?
 Why did you choose to heal that guy even though you knew he was suspicious?
Barbara starts to heal Uwe...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Don't look so serious, I know what you're thinking.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: I've heard a lot about the criminal methods of the Treasure Hoarders around Mondstadt.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Usually, if I come across a person like this, I'd simply ask them to seek help from somebody at the Church.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: But this fellow is in serious condition, he needs urgent healing...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: After all, I've got an Honorary Knight at my side to protect me, right?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: Hmm, let's gather the Small Lamp Grass and head back so we can heal him.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: This should do the trick, hold on a moment...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: Alright, that should do it. But just to be safe, you should probably pay a visit to the Church.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: Um... It crossed my mind.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: The fact was, you needed healing, right?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: And you hadn't done anything wrong. You just asked me for help.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: Whatever your true identity, in my eyes, you were merely a person in need of healing.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 13.ogg Barbara: Oh... Well, the best thing would be for you to come back to Mondstadt with us. The Church can help with your treatment, you're not fully healed yet...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 14.ogg Barbara: Hehe, what a strange character... but I hope his wounds will be okay.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 15.ogg Barbara: At least we got a hold of some Sweet Flowers! We were running out of time for me to whip you up some Chilibrew.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 barbara 16.ogg Barbara: Wow... this is a great batch! That's everything we need. It's getting late, let's get back to Mondstadt.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 01.ogg Uwe: Sister Deaconess... you're back!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 02.ogg Uwe: You adventurers... really are jumpy these days.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 03.ogg Uwe: Haha... no need. I should be able to recover by myself.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 04.ogg Uwe: Uh... S—Sister Deaconess...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 05.ogg Uwe: Why... weren't you suspicious of me? Like the adventurer here?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 06.ogg Uwe: Surely you've heard about the Treasure Hoarders and their methods... haha...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 07.ogg Uwe: Feigning injury by the roadside, begging for healing to get close to travelers, then striking at the opportune moment... Y'know, stuff like that...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 08.ogg Uwe: And... that's just one of their methods. Weren't you... worried that I might've been looking to harm you?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 09.ogg Uwe: And yet... Why did you still help me?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 10.ogg Uwe: Sister Deaconess...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 11.ogg Uwe: The truth is... I am a Treasure Hoarder. My plan was to feign injury in order to take advantage of the situation...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 12.ogg Uwe: But I ran into a group of monsters — I barely made it out. Then I realized I actually had to seek help from someone, anyone...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 13.ogg Uwe: But travelers all kept their distance, none of them believed me... Until you showed up.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 14.ogg Uwe: I—I can't thank you enough for healing me. I feel strong enough to carry on now... I won't trouble you anymore.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 15.ogg Uwe: Please! I've taken up enough of your time.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 16.ogg Uwe: Oh, these are for you. I'm afraid I have nothing of value to give, but... I picked these Sweet Flowers from nearby.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 17.ogg Uwe: Take them, as thanks for healing me. I will remember your kindness.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 18.ogg Uwe: In the future, if you have any trouble with... Treasure Hoarders... just mention my name, Uwe. I guarantee, they won't dare touch the hem of your jacket!
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 19.ogg Uwe: I must go. Farewell.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900801 uwe 20.ogg Uwe: Y—You got a problem? Stop looking at me like that...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Well, we're back. Whew... that was pretty tiring.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: I'm a deaconess, healing the wounded is something I must do.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Besides... I have a Vision. Even if he did try anything, I'd have been able to handle it.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: Not to mention, I had the Honorary Knight with me. If there'd been any danger... you would definitely have protected me, right?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: If I was alone... Mm...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: Well, for a Vision-bearer, I'm more adept at healing. If there were too many enemies, I guess I would've been defeated after a while...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: However, because I would've been alone... I wouldn't have risked an ambush by stopping to heal him myself. I would've just left some herbs with him instead.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 08.ogg Barbara: I'm good at remembering self-defense tactics like that.
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: After all, as Sister Victoria always says... don't go around healing people in the wild...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: Then again... What's the point of having a Vision if I can't stretch the rules once in a while? Hehe...
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 11.ogg Barbara: Oh — the Chilibrew! It shouldn't take long to make... Why don't you wait for me in the garden next to the Adventurers' Guild?
Media:vo bblcop001 1900802 barbara 12.ogg Barbara: I'll bring it straight over when it's ready.
