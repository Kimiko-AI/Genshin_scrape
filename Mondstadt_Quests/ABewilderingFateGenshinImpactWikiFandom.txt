 ...You mean Klee?!
 About Mona's background and her quandary...
 An intimidating resolution.
 As you said, this journey was all gain and no loss.
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 14a.ogg Mona: Thank you. Our traveling together was fate  and of the good kind, I'd say.
 Dendro Slimes must have done this.
 Does that really count as "temporary"?
 Guess you've got to keep working at it, then.
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 14b.ogg Mona: Yes... I don't really know what to do, but... I'll do my best.
 I can't read the stars...
 I can't tell fortunes...
 I haven't had a chance to look yet.
 I think she can do it.
 I'll take her to go have a look.
 It's a bomb again, isn't it?
 Of course.
 Quest DescriptionOn your journey, you witness Mona's strength as an astrologist, as well as her constraints. At last, you arrive at your destination – Mondstadt.
 Save a little here, scrimp a little there, and you'll be fine.
 See, I said this was a mistake.
 That was always the plan.
 There must be some mistake!
 There's no point getting mad at Klee.
 This has to be the work of Dendro Slimes.
 This might be her best option.
 Too embarrassing?
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 17a.ogg Mona: Yes. How can I maintain a proper astrologist's mentality if I stay with all these philistines?
 Too expensive?
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 17b.ogg Mona: Yes— I mean, no! You really have no way with words.
 T—That's all?
 We're getting nowhere fast.
 What a touching conclusion...
 Why do you always bury important things outdoors?
 Yup. Dendro Slimes.
Media:vo dialog mnlq003 mona 01.ogg Mona: That box is really important to me...
Media:vo dialog mnlq003 mona 02.ogg Mona: If anything were to happen to it, I wouldn't be able to report back to that old crone...
Media:vo dialog mnlq004 mona 01.ogg Mona: Cut that racket out! I'm doing experiments here!
Media:vo dialog mnlq004 mona 02.ogg Mona: Oh, it's you, (Traveler). I'm currently running some tests related to your situation. I should see some results soon, so please wait patiently.
Media:vo dialog mnlq004 mona 03.ogg Mona: Don't worry about me fainting from hunger. In any case, I've figured out a way to make some money...
Media:vo mnlq003 10 goth 01.ogg Goth: No need, no need, you have my utmost thanks.
Media:vo mnlq003 10 goth 02.ogg Goth: Oh, I'm Goth, the owner of this house. I passed by the Adventurers' Guild a while back, and Katheryne told me about the matter.
Media:vo mnlq003 10 goth 03.ogg Goth: I never thought that this troublesome seal would be dispelled so quickly!
Media:vo mnlq003 10 goth 04.ogg Goth: Of course, of course. The facilities inside were just being left there, anyway. I would be glad to have someone make use of them.
Media:vo mnlq003 10 goth 05.ogg Goth: To express my thanks, I shall rent this building to you at the lowest possible price!
Media:vo mnlq003 10 goth 06.ogg Goth: Help? Yes, of course, I understand. I am most thankful to you for that, so rest assured that I will give you the best rates!
Media:vo mnlq003 10 goth 07.ogg Goth: Great! Then we are agreed. I will go prepare the documentation, please wait here.
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 01.ogg Mona: The person who placed this seal... is by no means simple. Breaking this seal by force is nigh on impossible.
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 02.ogg Mona: Interesting. I suppose it's worth using my astrology on.
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 03.ogg Mona: Let me see... Hmm, I see, so if you first... ...and then you...
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 04.ogg Mona: Alright, it's open.
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 05.ogg Mona: You are...?
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 06.ogg Mona: Does that mean I can stay here?
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 07.ogg Mona: R—Rent?
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 08.ogg Mona: I didn't hear anything about rent, and I helped out, too...
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 09.ogg Mona: I... I mean...
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 10.ogg Mona: *sigh* I guess I don't have any other choice. I'll rent this place.
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 11.ogg Mona: Thanks for your help. Also, well, I'm very sorry, but I won't be able to do what I agreed to help you with just yet.
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 12.ogg Mona: Without the necessary tools, and without new knowledge, it will take me some time to see your destiny clearly.
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 13.ogg Mona: But I promise that I'll do a reading for you first thing once I'm ready!
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 14a.ogg Mona: Thank you. Our traveling together was fate  and of the good kind, I'd say.
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 14b.ogg Mona: Yes... I don't really know what to do, but... I'll do my best.
Media:vo mnlq003 10 mona 15.ogg Mona: I wish you both safe travels! As for me... I need to think of the future as well.
Media:vo mnlq003 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Holey moley, that's amazing!
Media:vo mnlq003 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Now we just need to go back to Katheryne, and you'll be able to stay here!
Media:vo mnlq003 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Paimon thinks Mona's misunderstood something, but...
Media:vo mnlq003 10 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: How is she going to make a living if she doesn't use astrology to make money?
Media:vo mnlq003 10 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Maybe we should come back to check on her once in a while. It would be really bad if she fainted from hunger in there...
Media:vo mnlq003 2 klee 01a.ogg Media:vo mnlq003 2 klee 01b.ogg Klee: Wow, it's you, (Mister/Miss) Honorary Knight! And Paimon too! You're back!
Media:vo mnlq003 2 klee 02.ogg Klee: Successor...?
Media:vo mnlq003 2 klee 03.ogg Klee: An ocean of stars? What's that? Does it have fish in it?
Media:vo mnlq003 2 klee 04.ogg Klee: I should be the one saying that! I didn't get what you said at all!
Media:vo mnlq003 2 klee 05.ogg Klee: That's right! Oh, so you're Mommy's friend! But she's gone very far away...
Media:vo mnlq003 2 klee 06.ogg Klee: Mystical... arts? I... don't get it. Mommy only taught me to make Jumpy Dumpties.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 klee 07.ogg Klee: Ooh, I know this one! So you're here for that box. I'll look. Wait here!
Media:vo mnlq003 2 klee 08.ogg Klee: Hmm... Not this one...
Media:vo mnlq003 2 klee 09.ogg Klee: Hmm... Hm... Or this one...
Media:vo mnlq003 2 klee 10.ogg Klee: No, no, it's not this one either...
Media:vo mnlq003 2 klee 11.ogg Klee: Ah! I remember now. I buried it together with my new treasure, at Windrise!
Media:vo mnlq003 2 klee 12.ogg Klee: Wait for me. I'll be right back!
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 01.ogg Mona: Are you ready? Don't shame your master now — we're about to meet that successor.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 02.ogg Mona: I guess... Wait, no! It won't do if you have no idea at all, even if you are a fake disciple.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 03.ogg Mona: We have a rule that forbids us from teaching outsiders, but I suppose... I suppose I could teach you.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 04.ogg Mona: My astrology is based on hydromancy, and as the name suggests, I use the reflections in water bodies to observe the true starry sky.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 05.ogg Mona: Allow me to demonstrate. Watch closely now.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 06.ogg Mona: From the present station and movement of the stars... I see, so that successor is a young... female... Knight of Favonius.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 07.ogg Mona: We will meet her here presently.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 08.ogg Mona: Well, that's all the information we need.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 09.ogg Mona: *sigh* It seems that even basic astrology can't be grasped in one go.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 10.ogg Mona: Never mind. I'll explain in detail later — she's here.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 11.ogg Mona: That's her! The successor to great knowledge!
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 12.ogg Mona: That's right. I am the astrologist who has plumbed the depths of the ocean of stars. Surely, you have long calculated my arrival as well.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 13.ogg Mona: Fish...? No, don't play dumb. Is this some kind of game?
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 14.ogg Mona: But my predictions can't be mistaken... Well, let's make sure. Your mother's name is Alice, isn't it?
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 15.ogg Mona: My readings told me as much. But before she left, she must have imparted her mystical arts to you, surely?
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 16.ogg Mona: Yes. As well-versed in astrology as she was, my master knew only astrology. Alice, on the other hand, was skilled in a great many other mystical fields.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 17.ogg Mona: Yes. It seems she has inherited the blood, but not the knowledge... what a miscalculation. There can be no contest like this.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 18.ogg Mona: Ah, yes. So, before Alice left, did she tell you about a fifty-year agreement, and about a certain box?
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 19.ogg Mona: I'll help her pack these things back in. You go after her.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 mona 20.ogg Mona: *sigh* Looking at how rash she is, I worry for the box...
Media:vo mnlq003 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Doesn't that sound like... Lisa?
Media:vo mnlq003 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So Klee's mother is the friend and rival of Mona's teacher?
Media:vo mnlq003 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Well... Klee's so young, so even if she'd heard this deep knowledge, she might not have understood.
Media:vo mnlq003 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Klee, don't just run off! Don't you need the things in your pack?
Media:vo mnlq003 4 klee 01.ogg Klee: We're heeere! This is it. Let's dig it up!
Media:vo mnlq003 4 klee 02.ogg Klee: It can't be. I put up a sign here. There's no mistake–
Media:vo mnlq003 4 klee 03.ogg Klee: Argh! Dendro Slimes!
Media:vo mnlq003 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: *sigh* We can talk later, let's take them out first!
Media:vo mnlq003 6 klee 01.ogg Klee: Found it! It's this box.
Media:vo mnlq003 6 klee 02.ogg Klee: Retrieval complete! Let's bring it back!
Media:vo mnlq003 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Glad it wasn't damaged in the explosions.
Media:vo mnlq003 7 klee 01.ogg Klee: We did. It's in perfect shape!
Media:vo mnlq003 7 klee 02.ogg Klee: Well... it's because I borrowed this box to store my treasures.
Media:vo mnlq003 7 klee 03.ogg Klee: But since you're here for the box, I took all my treasures out. That's why it's empty.
Media:vo mnlq003 7 klee 04.ogg Klee: Oh. You want the thing that used to be in the box? ...You should've said so.
Media:vo mnlq003 7 klee 05.ogg Klee: No! It's not broken at all!
Media:vo mnlq003 7 klee 06.ogg Klee: It's the book in your hand.
Media:vo mnlq003 7 klee 07.ogg Klee: Am... Am I in trouble?
Media:vo mnlq003 7 klee 08.ogg Klee: Ah! It was you who said you wanted the box. You didn't say anything about the thing inside!
Media:vo mnlq003 7 klee 09.ogg Klee: I don't know anything. I'm leaving! Bye!
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 01.ogg Mona: You're back at last. The wait was exceedingly dull.
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 02.ogg Mona: I had intended to read a book to pass the time, but this one was just some ridiculous diary. Nothing of note in it at all.
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 03.ogg Mona: It dropped from Klee's backpack, so I thought it might contain some ancient knowledge, but...
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 04.ogg Mona: Never mind that. So, did you find the box?
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 05.ogg Mona: That's wonderful— Wait a moment... W—Why isn't it locked?! And... why is it empty!?
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 06.ogg Mona: Borrowed?!
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 07.ogg Mona: You used it to store your things?! T—Then where are the original contents of the box? That's what I want.
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 08.ogg Mona: You haven't... broken it, have you?
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 09.ogg Mona: Phew...
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 10.ogg Mona: Whaaaaaaat—?!
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 11.ogg Mona: T—This... So this book, this diary... is that hag's... It's her diary from 50 years ago?!
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 12.ogg Mona: The thing she wanted back after 50 years was the dark history of her youth?
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 13.ogg Mona: Ah, I'm finished! No wonder... No wonder that old woman said that I should not look at it no matter what, or she'd rip me to shreds...
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 14.ogg Mona: Impossible. Astrology can see through all lies — you've seen it yourself.
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 15.ogg Mona: *sigh* After having spent all my Mora to come to Mondstadt, not only have I gained no knowledge, but now I can't return... How did it come to this...
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 16.ogg Mona: That's... too difficult. And even if I wanted to stay in Mondstadt, it would be...
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 17a.ogg Mona: Yes. How can I maintain a proper astrologist's mentality if I stay with all these philistines?
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 17b.ogg Mona: Yes— I mean, no! You really have no way with words.
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 18.ogg Mona: S—Stop talking about it! I... I guess I'll have to...
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 19.ogg Mona: I'll just have to stay in Mondstadt temporarily. Once that old crone's reached the end of her days, I'll be free.
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 20.ogg Mona: But what will I do about my astrology research? ...No, wait, I don't even have a place to stay.
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 21.ogg Mona: The Adventurers' Guild? Ah, right, you can do commissions for them in exchange for... you know what I mean, don't you?
Media:vo mnlq003 7 mona 22.ogg Mona: Oh. Um, thanks. I... Never mind, it's nothing.
Media:vo mnlq003 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ehhh?!
Media:vo mnlq003 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Umm... Well, if you don't say anything, your master won't find out, will she?
Media:vo mnlq003 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: That's so sad... Maybe you could forget everything in that book, and then go back?
Media:vo mnlq003 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Well, then you'll just have to go back to face your master.
Media:vo mnlq003 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: About that, we can go ask Katheryne at the Adventurers' Guild. Let's see if she can help.
Media:vo mnlq003 8 katheryne 01.ogg Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild.
Media:vo mnlq003 8 katheryne 02.ogg Katheryne: I see. I understand the situation.
Media:vo mnlq003 8 katheryne 03.ogg Katheryne: There is a magic laboratory in Mondstadt that has been sealed by some unknown person.
Media:vo mnlq003 8 katheryne 04.ogg Katheryne: Although we have a few specialists who could break that seal, they all have their own labs, and aren't that interested in the matter.
Media:vo mnlq003 8 katheryne 05.ogg Katheryne: I believe that if the astrologist you mentioned can break that seal, the owner of that house wouldn't mind if she stayed there.
Media:vo mnlq003 8 katheryne 06.ogg Katheryne: Alright. Then, allow me to tell you where the house is.
