 Sorry, I'm dealing with something else right now.

(Does not accept the quest)
 You must be looking for these.
Dr. Edith: Hmm, I wonder why my delivery hasn't arrived...
Dr. Edith: Oh! I never expected you to be the one delivering this!
Dr. Edith: This is a huge help. Please, take these.
Dr. Edith: Traveler! How can I help?
Dr. Livingstone: But I just need a moment of your time. Could you give this to Dr. Edith for me?
Dr. Livingstone: I was planning to deliver it myself but something else came up...
Dr. Livingstone: Luckily I have you to help. I am very grateful.
Dr. Livingstone: Okay then. To be fair, you do seem to be getting more on your plate each day!
Dr. Livingstone: Traveler! Fancy meeting you here. I'm sure you are very busy, as always.
