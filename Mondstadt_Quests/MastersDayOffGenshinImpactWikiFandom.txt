 Actually, Dandelion Knight suits you better.
 Actually, I knew nothing about this whole thing either.
Media:vo qinlq005 8 qin 04a.ogg Jean: Either way, it is good to be here together with everyone. It has lifted my spirits.
 All those last-minute urgent orders... It was you all along!
 Are you having a good time?
 Has there been a bar fight!?
 He could be luring Jean into a trap...
 How is Jean doing?
 I could get used to Jean the Lionfang Knight...
 I'm sure you must be exhausted, too.
Media:vo qinlq005 1 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Oh it's nothing, looking after patients is all in a day's work for me.
 Jean is still recovering, right?
 Jean, Vennessa would be so proud of who you are right now.
 Let the Wind lead.
 Me?
 Quest DescriptionToday's commissions are done and dusted. Time to check up on Jean at the Cathedral.
 So... You gave me the credit to hide your own shyness?
 The organizer?
 There you are.
 Uh... This explains a lot!
 We'll go. Jean needs to rest.
 Why did you say I was the organizer?
 Will she be okay out there on her own, in her condition?
 You can always rely on other knights.
 You can always rely on us.
 You should go back and rest.
 You'd better believe it!
 You're looking more upbeat now.
Media:vo qinlq005 8 qin 04b.ogg Jean: It is good to be here together with everyone. It has lifted my spirits.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 ambor 01.ogg Amber: (Traveler)...
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 ambor 02.ogg Amber: Two things! One, this Sweet Madame! Two, this Sticky Honey Roast!
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 ambor 03.ogg Amber: Did you make them?
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 ambor 04.ogg Amber: Mmm... I refuse to believe it! Where did you suddenly learn to cook so well?
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 ambor 05.ogg Amber: I'm going to finish eating this, and then you're going to teach me everything you know! Don't you dare try and run off!
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 ambor 06.ogg Amber: *om nom nom*
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Jean is not as strong as she comes off. It's so good that you're here for her.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Whew... This is quite a lot of excitement, considering that the idea was to relax and take it easy.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Ahh... Is there anything without alcohol?
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: Oh, y'know, I normally mix a few things together but I always add some bright red—
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: ...Hehe, chilis! I add chili peppers.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: That's glass number thirty-seven.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: I am keeping count of this bard's alarming pace of progress through my wine.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Only the Knights drink for free tonight. It seems he didn't get the message.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: When he sobers up, I will present him with the bill.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: ...I'm joking, of course. I highly doubt he could afford it anyway, so I shall spare him the bill.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: But I must say, the sheer volume of alcohol this fellow can put back is just not normal.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Hey! Having a good time?
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: The thing is, Jean knows all of us so well now...
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: When someone organizes a surprise party for you, the closer you are to them, the more bashful you tend to feel about the whole thing.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: So instead, we just gave you all the credit. After all, you did do more than your fair share of work anyway.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Haha... You think so?
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Hehe... I'm only indulging you since it's such a special day today.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 lisa 01.ogg Lisa: "Leaving the hustle and bustle of the banquet behind them, the two of them stood there, together in the quiet of the night, while the rest of the world melted away around them..."
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 lisa 02.ogg Lisa: Sounds like the sort of thing you'd find in a romantic novel, no?
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 lisa 03.ogg Lisa: I'm not trying to get you to recite poetry to me or anything...
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 lisa 04.ogg Lisa: I'm just saying, Jean went upstairs to the balcony. Alone. Now's your chance... Hehe.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Would a drink help you relax?
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What do you normally drink?
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Red? Let me guess... tomatoes? No, watermelon?
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Chili peppers!? In a drink?
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Of course! This party was clearly Kaeya's idea! Shy Kaeya? This is gold!
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: So you admit it!
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Venti can drink a frightening amount...
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: That would be the drink talking...
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: What's Diluc doing?
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Diluc... You're a meanie!
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Amber! You look like you're about to burst into tears, whatever is the matter?
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Has... Amber been drinking?
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 venti 01.ogg Venti: My word, the Dawn Winery's wine is every bit as delectable as they say!
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 venti 02.ogg Venti: I would never be able to afford this normally, so in the spirit of enjoying the moment while it lasts... Another glass for the bard, please!
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 venti 03.ogg Venti: Ah, hello! I didn't see you there.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 venti 04.ogg Venti: I blame the wine for monopolizing my attention! Much like my ballads, it deserves to be enjoyed for generations to come.
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 venti 05.ogg Venti: What is this floating sensation I feel? Have I discovered the true meaning of Anemo power?
Media:vo dialog qinlq005 venti 06.ogg Venti: I hereby declare that every son and daughter of the City of the Wind must be compelled to taste this finest of wines... Here's to good wine!
Media:vo ktlq005 cs qin 01.ogg Jean: Lady Vennessa, I hope your watch over Mondstadt remains unclouded.
Media:vo ktlq005 cs qin 02.ogg Media:vo ktlq005 cs qin 03.ogg Media:vo ktlq005 cs qin 04.ogg Jean: I do not know if I, or the rest of the world, as you had hoped for have become stronger... Huh?
(Traveler and Paimon talk to Jean)
Media:vo qinlq005 1 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Welcome back. You must be exhausted.
Media:vo qinlq005 1 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Oh it's nothing, looking after patients is all in a day's work for me.
Media:vo qinlq005 1 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Jean has regained consciousness and should be back to her normal self soon enough.
Media:vo qinlq005 1 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: But she just left the Cathedral. I tried to tell her she needs more rest, but she wouldn't listen.
Media:vo qinlq005 1 barbara 05.ogg Barbara: She tried to act like she was fine and kept saying she wanted to get some fresh air. I bet you she's gone to Lady Vennessa's place again.
Media:vo qinlq005 1 barbara 06.ogg Barbara: Oh, that huge tree at Windrise. That place is dedicated to Mondstadt's hero, Vennessa.
Media:vo qinlq005 1 barbara 07.ogg Barbara: Jean goes there whenever she feels lost and confused, deep down inside.
Media:vo qinlq005 1 barbara 08.ogg Barbara ...Jean uh, mentioned it to me, y'know, before she left.
Media:vo qinlq005 1 barbara 09.ogg Barbara: That's what I'm worried about, too. But I still have work to do here...
Media:vo qinlq005 1 barbara 10.ogg Barbara: Great! That puts my mind at rest. May the Anemo Archon protect you... and Jean.
Media:vo qinlq005 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whew, think we're finally finished with the commissions we were doing for Jean. A day in the life of Jean really is hard work...
Media:vo qinlq005 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wonder how she's feeling now? Let's head to the Cathedral and pay her a visit.
Media:vo qinlq005 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hi Barbara, we're back.
Media:vo qinlq005 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: That's great news! Let's go and see her.
Media:vo qinlq005 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Where?
Media:vo qinlq005 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Barbara, that's some pretty personal stuff... How do you know so much about Jean's innermost thoughts?
Media:vo qinlq005 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Don't worry, we'll take over nursing duty for now.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 abyss 01.ogg Abyss Mage: Hmph... Caught red-handed.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 abyss 02.ogg Abyss Mage: Finally, an opportunity comes to get rid of the Master in her moment of weakness... and then you two show up and ruin everything.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 abyss 03.ogg Abyss Mage: Hmm, since this opportunity has slipped away, I shall now be slipping away in a similar fashion...
Media:vo qinlq005 4 abyss 04.ogg Abyss Mage: Looks like our fates are intertwined. To think you chased me this far!
Media:vo qinlq005 4 abyss 05.ogg Abyss Mage: Hehe, come on! Face my brave subordinates. I put a spell on them to calm their fear of water.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 abyss 06.ogg Abyss Mage: Hehehe, face the fury of my flames! Just one is enough to reignite the fiery fury of the rest!
(The Abyss Mage reveals himself)
Media:vo qinlq005 4 abyss 07.ogg Abyss Mage: Looks like our fates are intertwined. To think you pushed me this far! Fine — let me deal with you myself!
(After defeating the Abyss Mage)
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hi Jean, are you feeling better now?
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Are you sure? We saw you beneath the tree just now, leaning on your sword — it looked like you were struggling.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Are you sure you aren't pushing yourself too hard?
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: You truly revere Vennessa, huh?
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Dandelion Knight — isn't that your title?
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Oooh, that makes sense now.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: You too want to be as gentle as the Dandelion Knight and yet as fierce as the Lionfang Knight?
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Paimon thinks so too!
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Jean?
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: How did they know about Jean's condition?
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Choosing this moment to strike is a low blow, even for this lot.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Jean, you're still recovering...
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: *sigh* Jean, you can't keep doing this to yourself. Why can't you trust us to handle it?
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Fine, but at least let us go with you.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Are you hurt!?
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Ugh, darn him and his traps!
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: No! You're in no state to handle this alone. We're coming too!
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Thanks, you're amazing!
(As you explore the domain)
Media:vo qinlq005 4 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: The main thing is that you're safe. Now, isn't it time to get back to Mondstadt and rest, Acting Grand Master?
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 01.ogg Jean: Much better. I was not expecting you to come here. Thank you for your concern.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 02.ogg Jean: Oh... Thank you, that means a lot to me. Hearing that boosts my spirits.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 03.ogg Jean: But I must find a way to cope with minor setbacks like this on my own. Otherwise, how can I be the protector that Mondstadt needs me to be? The protector that Vennessa was...
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 04.ogg Jean: I do. Vennessa was the first Grand Master, a kind yet formidable woman. I have always hoped to follow in her footsteps.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 05.ogg Jean: As the Lionfang Knight, she courageously overthrew the oppressive ruling aristocracy of her time. Then, she founded the Knights of Favonius and became known as the Dandelion Knight, spreading grace and compassion throughout the land.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 06.ogg Jean: Hmm... Actually, all of the Knights of Favonius' Masters throughout the ages have inherited the title of "Dandelion Knight" or "Lionfang Knight."
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 07.ogg Jean: Yes. I know it sounds like a huge honor, inheriting both these titles from Vennessa...
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 08.ogg Jean: But I see it more as a huge responsibility.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 09.ogg Jean: After all, it is a lot to live up to.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 10.ogg Jean: ...
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 11.ogg Jean: Who's there?
(An Abyss Mage shows itself)
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 12.ogg Jean: As long as my name is the Dandelion Knight, I swear I shall not be defeated by such despicable means!
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 13.ogg Jean: Stop! *cough*
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 14.ogg Jean: After him... *cough*
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 15.ogg Jean: No. I must got after him...
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 16.ogg Jean: I do trust you... But to let an enemy get away like this would be a major dereliction of duty.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 17.ogg Jean: Thank you for your understanding. I will graciously accept your help.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 18.ogg Jean: How badly are you hurt? One of my own being injured because of me is the last thing I would wish for.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 19.ogg Jean: ...Let me handle this alone.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 20.ogg Jean: ...Okay. But before we move out, at least let me heal everyone with my Dandelion Breeze.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 21.ogg Jean: Phew... Thanks to Barbara's help, my condition is better than I thought.
Media:vo qinlq005 4 qin 22.ogg Jean: Yes. I should at least go and thank Barbara again. I hope she is not upset with me.
Media:vo qinlq005 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh?
Media:vo qinlq005 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: For goodness sake... What is happening to the world!? Swan used to be the most honest fellow, now he's dumping things onto Jean...
Media:vo qinlq005 5 qin 01.ogg Jean: Swan? Were you waiting for me? Has something happened?
Media:vo qinlq005 5 qin 02.ogg Jean: Well, if you say so Swan, I will go. I should not let the other knights down.
Media:vo qinlq005 5 qin 03.ogg Jean: It's fine. Now that I have had the chance to stretch my legs, I feel much better.
Media:vo qinlq005 5 qin 04.ogg Jean: Well... Swan was clearly agitated. Maybe it is an emergency after all. Let's go and see what this is all about, shall we?
Media:vo qinlq005 5 swan 01.ogg Swan: Master, you've finally returned! The Anemo Archon protects you.
Media:vo qinlq005 5 swan 02.ogg Swan: Yes... At the Angel's Share. Don't worry, it's nothing big, but...
Media:vo qinlq005 5 swan 03.ogg Swan: Ah... I know I said it's nothing big, but... Alright, how can I put this... They just really need the Acting Grand Master.
Media:vo qinlq005 5 swan 04.ogg Swan: Great! Thank you so much, you really saved me this one.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 ambor 01.ogg Amber: It's a thank-you party for you!
Media:vo qinlq005 7 ambor 02.ogg Amber: We can only imagine how much pressure you must be under as Acting Grand Master, and you do so much work all over Mondstadt...
Media:vo qinlq005 7 ambor 03.ogg Amber: Jean?
Media:vo qinlq005 7 ambor 04.ogg Amber: Huh? Is this Jean when she's... shy? I've never seen her like this!
Media:vo qinlq005 7 ambor 05.ogg Amber: Hehehe. Well, it's nothing compared to the amount of work you do for all of us, day-in and day-out.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 ambor 06.ogg Amber: It was no different from what we see on patrol. A couple of hilichurls. Didn't take much to get rid of them.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 ambor 07.ogg Amber: Agreed! Now — let the party begin!
(The party starts)
Media:vo qinlq005 7 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Jean, when we heard the news about your illness, we were all so worried about you.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Alright, alright! Jean's supposed to be taking it easy, stop crowding her!
Media:vo qinlq005 7 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: ...Despite my initial reluctance to sponsor a Knights of Favonius event in any way...
Media:vo qinlq005 7 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: I, like any other citizen of Mondstadt, owe Jean my gratitude for her hard work.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: We thought that since you so rarely take any time off, we'd take this chance to throw you a party. Enjoy yourself, Jean.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: After all, you'll never let us do this once you're back at work, haha.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Fear not. We wanted to make sure you could relax and enjoy yourself...
Media:vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: So while you were away, we all pitched in and finished off your work for you. Every last task.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Haha... Actually, (Traveler) was the key organizer behind all of this.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: See all this food and drink? (Traveler) made sure it all arrived on time.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 07a.ogg Media:vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 07b.ogg Kaeya: Not only that but (he/she) cooked each one of these beautiful dishes (himself/herself).
Media:vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: So relax already. There's no need to be so modest!
Media:vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Of course, we also have Master Diluc to thank for the venue. Otherwise, we would be looking at quite an alarming bill right about now.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 lisa 01.ogg Lisa: It's easy to forget that outside of work, Jean is just a normal person, like anyone else.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 lisa 02.ogg Crowd: *sigh*
Media:vo qinlq005 7 lisa 03.ogg Lisa: I spend so much time doing library admin. A few more pieces of paper to deal with was really nothing to worry about.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 lisa 04.ogg Lisa: Enough already! No more thinking about work today! Enjoy yourself while you've got the chance.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: ...Are you kidding me?
Media:vo qinlq005 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: It looks like everyone seems to be partying hard...
Media:vo qinlq005 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Paimon thinks we should join in the fun. Let's go and mingle!
Media:vo qinlq005 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh, and Paimon thinks she saw Jean go upstairs by herself... Let's make sure the woman of the hour doesn't get left out.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 qin 01.ogg Jean: Oh? What's all this?
Media:vo qinlq005 7 qin 02.ogg Jean: A thank-you party?
Media:vo qinlq005 7 qin 03.ogg Jean: Ahh...
Media:vo qinlq005 7 qin 04.ogg Jean: I... Uh...
Media:vo qinlq005 7 qin 05.ogg Jean: I... This is just all such a surprise!
Media:vo qinlq005 7 qin 06.ogg Jean: Thank you, everyone. This really means so much to me.
Media:vo qinlq005 7 qin 07.ogg Jean: But... there are so many things I still need to do...
Media:vo qinlq005 7 qin 08.ogg Jean: Did you really? ...Even the issue with the food deliveries?
Media:vo qinlq005 7 qin 09.ogg Jean: And the tax returns?
Media:vo qinlq005 7 qin 10.ogg Jean: Well... What about Margaret's missing cat?
Media:vo qinlq005 7 qin 11.ogg Jean: It is my honor to work alongside you all. Praise be for the Anemo Archon's guidance...
Media:vo qinlq005 7 qin 12.ogg Jean: Speaking of work... It must have been hard work to put all this together, where did you find the time?
Media:vo qinlq005 7 qin 13.ogg Jean: Oh Master Diluc, I—
Media:vo qinlq005 7 venti 02.ogg Venti: That rascally Prince was apprehended by the brilliant (Mr./Ms.) (Traveler)! And (he/she) also reclaimed my precious astral iron strings while (he/she) was at it.
Media:vo qinlq005 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh, it seems like something's bothering Jean.
Media:vo qinlq005 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What's that?
Media:vo qinlq005 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Jean, Vennessa would be so proud of who you are right now.
Media:vo qinlq005 8 qin 01.ogg Jean: Oh, it is you.
Media:vo qinlq005 8 qin 02.ogg Jean: Yes, I am just... getting some air.
Media:vo qinlq005 8 qin 03.ogg Jean: (Traveler), I want to thank you again—
Media:vo qinlq005 8 qin 04a.ogg Jean: Either way, it is good to be here together with everyone. It has lifted my spirits.
Media:vo qinlq005 8 qin 04b.ogg Jean: It is good to be here together with everyone. It has lifted my spirits.
Media:vo qinlq005 8 qin 05.ogg Jean: And it has taught me something.
Media:vo qinlq005 8 qin 06.ogg Jean: I am definitely more of a Dandelion Knight than a Lionfang Knight.
Media:vo qinlq005 8 qin 07.ogg Jean: The Lionfang Knight represents Vennessa's past — a past in which she fought hard for Mondstadt.
Media:vo qinlq005 8 qin 08.ogg Jean: But it was the Dandelion Knight that represented her hopes for the future — a future belonging to the newly formed Knights of Favonius...
Media:vo qinlq005 8 qin 09.ogg Jean: I do believe that Vennessa watches over us, whether from high up above, or from the wind all around us.
Media:vo qinlq005 8 qin 10.ogg Jean: Let the Wind lead. The winds of freedom will guide us along the path that lies ahead. I hope you will continue to join us on that path, (Traveler).
You enjoy a spirited and cheerful party—
