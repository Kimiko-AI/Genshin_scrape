Media:vo hyeq002 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Shall we read another one, (Traveler)?
(Return to letter selection)

Media:vo hyeq002 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Do you want to keep reading them? Or have you got the gist now, (Traveler)?
 Let's read one more letter.
Media:vo hyeq002 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Okay. Remember, we're trying to figure out when each letter was written.

 (At least we got to see the Diluc of the past.)
 (It was worth it for that experience.)
 A Letter With Clear Handwriting
 A Letter With Clear Handwriting
A Letter With Clear Handwriting: Master,
A Letter With Clear Handwriting: Master Kaeya took leave and stayed at Dawn Winery for a few days.
A Letter With Clear Handwriting: In a rare turn of events, he decided to stay in his original bedroom. He would pace about the grounds when idle, and even asked Adelinde to make him his favorite dishes.
A Letter With Clear Handwriting: Ah, it really does take me back.
A Letter With Clear Handwriting: I shall be honest with you, but I was quite surprised to hear Master Kaeya say that he wanted to stay for a few days.
A Letter With Clear Handwriting: We did not refuse him, however. We believe that even if you were here, you would not refuse him outright.
A Letter With Clear Handwriting: Dawn Winery has always been a more quiet location, perhaps because all who stay here are rather peaceable people.
A Letter With Clear Handwriting: The house is made by those who live in it, and Master Kaeya's uncommon arrival did end up livening the place up significantly.
A Letter With Clear Handwriting: I hope that you are doing well in your travels abroad. Everyone here at the winery misses you.
A Letter With Clear Handwriting: May you remain safe and in good health.
 A Letter With Elegant Handwriting
 A Letter With Elegant Handwriting
A Letter With Elegant Handwriting: Dear Diluc,
A Letter With Elegant Handwriting: Welcome back to Mondstadt, Sir.
A Letter With Elegant Handwriting: It has been some time since the incident. We discovered that Eroch had betrayed us, and he has been punished severely.
A Letter With Elegant Handwriting: I hope that this news will put your mind at ease.
A Letter With Elegant Handwriting: In other news, our people have discovered that the Abyss Order has stepped up its activities between Wolvendom and Stone Gate lately.
A Letter With Elegant Handwriting: Also â€” a mysterious individual that people are calling the "Darknight Hero" has suddenly started showing up out of nowhere all around Mondstadt City. He typically acts in the dead of night, and his intentions are currently unclear.
A Letter With Elegant Handwriting: Please stay safe, and notify the Knights as soon as possible should you see anything suspicious. We will send support immediately.
A Letter With Elegant Handwriting: Whether you are presently in our ranks or not, all faithful knights will remember your contributions to the Knights of Favonius.
A Letter With Elegant Handwriting: May you remain in good health.
 A Letter With Rough Handwriting
 A Letter With Rough Handwriting
A Letter With Rough Handwriting: Diluc,
A Letter With Rough Handwriting: Jean wrote to me lately with shocking news. If I don't miss my guess, she wrote to you too. Her sentiments are those of the Knights as a whole.
A Letter With Rough Handwriting: Crepus was a good man, and I thought very well of him. It grieves me greatly to know that he met with such a fate.
A Letter With Rough Handwriting: As for the defeat of the drake, the honors for that accomplishment should go to your father. I do not accept Eroch's theft of the credit for that deed, which was bought with your father's sacrifice.
A Letter With Rough Handwriting: Stolen credit will not be accepted within the Knights of Favonius under any circumstances. I will not permit it.
A Letter With Rough Handwriting: I have already given Jean the authority to punish Eroch with all necessary severity. The Knights will inform you of the results.
A Letter With Rough Handwriting: I've heard that you've been taking some time off outdoors and may not be easy to reach, so there is no guarantee that my letter will reach you. As such, I'll stop here for now.
A Letter With Rough Handwriting: If it does reach you, then I wish you good health and safety in your travels. Contact us if you need anything.
A Letter With Rough Handwriting: I hope that falcon of yours will help put this letter in your hands. I mean, I don't write in person very often, you know?
A Letter With Rough Handwriting: These may seem like pointless words to you right now, but remember: even the greatest of disasters must come to an end.
A Letter With Rough Handwriting: Mondstadt waits for your return, and if you're willing, the Knights will always welcome you. (If you're not, forget I said anything, yeah?)
 A Neatly Written Letter
 A Neatly Written Letter
A Neatly Written Letter: Dear Mr. Diluc,
A Neatly Written Letter: It is my pleasure to investigate the ley lines alongside you.
A Neatly Written Letter: As you know, my focus is on alchemy, so my knowledge of the ley lines remains quite shallow, and I fear that I will only be able to share what little understanding I have.
A Neatly Written Letter: According to many pre-existing documents, the ley lines can be seen as a medium for storing information. Under certain circumstances, they can record activities that occur in the area around them.
A Neatly Written Letter: All this information goes through a recording and storage process. After a certain period of time, they may be released once again by the ley lines.
A Neatly Written Letter: If I may be so bold as to make a guess, there should be a method to activate the ley lines. Those who grasp such methods can control the times at which ley line information is recorded and released.
A Neatly Written Letter: Judging from the runic symbols and some other clues, I surmise that there are particular members of the Abyss Order who may have a very small chance of being able to achieve this.
A Neatly Written Letter: If you believe that this requires further investigation, these entities may serve as your point of entry.
A Neatly Written Letter: I wrote a paper a few years ago in which I covered my brief foray into questions concerning the flow of ley lines and other such topics. You will find a copy of this paper enclosed.
A Neatly Written Letter: I hope that it can help to clear up some of your doubts.
 A New Letter
 A New Letter
A New Letter: Dear Darknight Hero, the Knights of Favonius have stepped up the guard details throughout Mondstadt without making any major movements. The Abyss Order will not have noticed.
A New Letter: I am scouting around Dragonspine. The monsters here are scattered and separated. Clearly, they haven't been assembled by the Abyss Order.
A New Letter: There are no signs of enemy activity in the south of Mondstadt either.
A New Letter: If you can confirm that the other locations are also free of monsters, we will be able to conclude that the Abyss Order has nothing to do with the recent ley line disorder.
 A Tidily Written Letter
 A Tidily Written Letter
A Tidily Written Letter: To the heir of the Ragnvindr Clan,
A Tidily Written Letter: I apologize for sending this letter without notice. You may not remember me, but we've met a few times.
A Tidily Written Letter: We've met near the square, when I sat at the table adjacent to yours at the Good Hunter, and I've seen you in your tavern...
A Tidily Written Letter: You were always busy with a great many things, especially back when you were much chattier than you are now. You spoke cheerfully and often with your brother and friends then.
A Tidily Written Letter: It's probably no surprise that you did not notice me then. But I've always had my eye on you, child.
A Tidily Written Letter: I recall with crystal clarity how my little Klee once made a complete mess of your vineyard while she was trying to catch Crystalflies there...
A Tidily Written Letter: But you didn't get angry. In fact, you personally escorted Klee back and even gave her a few bottles of fresh grape juice.
A Tidily Written Letter: Now I think that might jog your memory, yes?
A Tidily Written Letter: Klee recently told me that she "hasn't seen that strange man with the red hair in aaages," so I decided to look into it out of curiosity.
A Tidily Written Letter: My deepest condolences regarding your father.
A Tidily Written Letter: In many of the stories I've been told, you are the model knight: proud, driven, a knight of noble character and lineage.
A Tidily Written Letter: But I know that you're gentler than you appear. If you weren't, you wouldn't have treated Klee the way you did.
A Tidily Written Letter: And since you helped my child out, I hope you won't mind if I treat you as if you were my own.
A Tidily Written Letter: Therefore, I sincerely hope that you will leave the dark place that you are presently in, and that you will not wallow in grief and remorse.
A Tidily Written Letter: Partings are most painful things, but they also encourage us to grow. A bird that has lost the roof over its head will fly further than others of its kind.
A Tidily Written Letter: Go out and see the world. That's the best course of action I can envision. Only by feeling, observing, and listening can your heart be healed.
A Tidily Written Letter: Parents all wish that they can accompany their children forever, and the skies, seas, and stars bear witness to that oath.
A Tidily Written Letter: Everything that was your father now finds new life with you. That which you will experience in this world may have been things that your father experienced once upon a time.
A Tidily Written Letter: I hope that the wind will bring you all manner of wondrous things in your journeys to come.
A Tidily Written Letter: In any case, keep your chin up, young child.
 Are you in a hurry?
 But Diluc seems to have found some peace since then.
 Do you still have other business to attend to?
 Even if we hadn't gone to Falcon Coast...
 I'm all set.
 It almost sounds like you're doing the Knights of Favonius a favor.
 It's been a long time since Diluc's presence last overawed you, huh.
 Let's read one more letter.
 Maybe we could help meet those guests?
 Paimon, you need to calm down.
 Quest DescriptionYou and Paimon patrolled the area near the abnormal ley line deposit for several days. It is time now, it seems, to report back to Adelinde.
 So this is a joint initiative between you and the Knights.
 That battle was a lot of fun.
 That battle went very smoothly.
 Things that involve fighting?
 Wait, let me think...
Media:vo hyeq002 4 paimon 05b.ogg Paimon: Bad idea? Yeah, you're probably right... Okay, let's just tidy them up a little.
 We help Diluc out.
 We probably would have been fighting monsters somewhere else...
 We really shouldn't be reading other people's mail...
Media:vo hyeq002 4 paimon 05a.ogg Paimon: That's true. In that case, let's just tidy them up a little.
 Well, in for one Mora, in for the lot...
 What is it that you need our help with?
 Why didn't you stay there to keep guard?
 You don't look like you just got back from the city...
 You seem to be in a huge rush...
A Letter With Clear Handwriting: Ah, it really does take me back.
A Letter With Clear Handwriting: Dawn Winery has always been a more quiet location, perhaps because all who stay here are rather peaceable people.
A Letter With Clear Handwriting: I hope that you are doing well in your travels abroad. Everyone here at the winery misses you.

Diluc swiftly goes upstairs...
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 adelinde 01.ogg Adelinde: Please make yourselves comfortable in the Winery.
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 adelinde 02.ogg Adelinde: And thanks again for helping with the letter.
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 adelinde 03.ogg Adelinde: Hello, Master Kaeâ€” Ahem, I mean Captain Kaeya.
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 adelinde 04.ogg Adelinde: I don't believe we were expecting you. Has something urgent come up?
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 adelinde 05.ogg Adelinde: Really? What can I say, Captain Kaeya... You and the Darknight Hero have never been seen in the same place at the same time, and you often show up at the Dawn Winery â€” just like the Darknight Hero.
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 adelinde 06.ogg Adelinde: So is it safe to say that... you are the Darknight Hero?
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 adelinde 07.ogg Adelinde: I'm sorry, Captain Kaeya, but the Dawn Winery is having a fire safety inspection today.
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 adelinde 08.ogg Adelinde: You'll have to come back another day.
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 adelinde 09.ogg Adelinde: Captain Kaeya, your words are as profound and enigmatic as ever. I'm just a maid, none of that means anything to me.
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 adelinde 10.ogg Adelinde: Master is currently out at a business meeting with his commercial partners. I don't know where they are exactly.
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 adelinde 11.ogg Adelinde: I will pass your message on to him word for word when he gets back, but I can't guarantee that the meaning behind the words will be fully conveyed.
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 adelinde 12.ogg Adelinde: Captain Kaeya, you are too funny. You know we don't do retail.
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 adelinde 13.ogg Adelinde: Still, thank you so much for visiting.
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Oh, Adelinde, don't be such a stranger, hehe.
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: The Knights of Favonius have received word of another sighting of the Darknight Hero. Now, the witness wasn't able to see where the suspect was headed, however...
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: I just have a gut feeling that he's in the Dawn Winery area.
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Hahaha, now that you mention it, it makes sense. I almost can't believe it â€” I am the legendary Darknight Hero!
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Seriously? Shouldn't you at least ask me to stay for dinner, as a courtesy?
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: *sigh* Then again, I do have a pile of admin work waiting for me today...
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: In that case, please pass a message on to Diluc for me. Tell him that the hazard zone has been established, the public shouldn't notice anything, and the enemy is unlikely to detect it right away.
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Oh? But these are code words he grew up using. If he doesn't understand them... then perhaps it was a wasted childhood.
Media:vo dialog hyeq002 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Oh, by the way, is there anything new at the Winery? While I'm here, I'd like to pick up some choice wine to take home.
Media:vo hyeq002 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We've been fighting here for a while now.
Media:vo hyeq002 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon's starting to wonder if we should've left the ley line deposit alone... Maybe then, the monsters would have stopped coming...
Media:vo hyeq002 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Also, Paimon still doesn't have a clue what's going on here... Shall we just go ask Diluc?
Media:vo hyeq002 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Yeah, c'mon, let's get back to the Dawn Winery, (Traveler).
Media:vo hyeq002 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: These letters cover a whole load of different events. Paimon never knew Diluc's past was so complicated...
Media:vo hyeq002 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We're really gonna have to study all the details to figure out how everything fits together.
Media:vo hyeq002 12 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Which letter do you wanna read next, (Traveler)?
Media:vo hyeq002 2 adelinde 01.ogg Adelinde: You're finally back.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 adelinde 02.ogg Adelinde: I didn't think you'd be gone for so long. Sorry if it was too much trouble.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 adelinde 03.ogg Adelinde: Sorry, I'm not sure of Master's whereabouts either. But I did hear that he recently visited Angel's Share.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 adelinde 04.ogg Adelinde: After dealing with this kind of trouble, Master is always careful to tie up all loose ends. It's become something of a routine.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 adelinde 05.ogg Adelinde: He should be back very soon. You needn't worry. In the meantime, please make yourself comfortable in the Winery.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 adelinde 06.ogg Adelinde: Oh, thanks for your concern. But I've actually been instructed by Master to meet with some special guests here.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 adelinde 07.ogg Adelinde: Certain guests may need reminding to stay away for the time being.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 adelinde 08.ogg Adelinde: Master hopes that under the present circumstances, these guests will keep an appropriate distance from the Winery, so as not to make a difficult situation even more complicated.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 adelinde 09.ogg Adelinde: That's very kind of you indeed, but you've already helped Master Diluc out a great deal. You can let me take care of these time-consuming chores.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 adelinde 10.ogg Adelinde: There is one small thing you could do for me, though. Please take this letter and place it on the table to your right as you enter the door.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 adelinde 11.ogg Adelinde: There are a few archived letters on that table already. Just put this one at the very top of the pile.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 adelinde 12.ogg Adelinde: Yes, it's from one of his informants. Only those in Master's inner circle are permitted to handle it or serve as custodian.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 adelinde 13.ogg Adelinde: Of course. Master Diluc greatly values your friendship. Thanks again for the help.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: That's okay. We did offer to help.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So anyway, is Master Diluc back yet? We didn't see him at Falcon Coast.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: After all that, we managed to completely miss him...
Media:vo hyeq002 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh well. Let's just wait for him at the Winery this time.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: By the way, Adelinde, how come you're always standing here at the door lately? Usually, you're busy indoors.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hopefully you haven't been standing there waiting for Master Diluc this whole time...? 'Cause that would be reeeally tiring!
Media:vo hyeq002 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Huh? Well, Paimon didn't understand any of that, but... it sounds like a really important job.
Media:vo hyeq002 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Is this a letter for Master Diluc?
Media:vo hyeq002 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Ooh, that means we're part of Diluc's inner circle!
Media:vo hyeq002 26 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Let's sort Diluc's letters for him.
Media:vo hyeq002 26 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Well, since he said he doesn't mind, why don't we read them as we go?
Media:vo hyeq002 27 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: There, it's done.
Media:vo hyeq002 27 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: The ley line deposit will disappear before long.
Media:vo hyeq002 27 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Sidekicks, hmm...
Media:vo hyeq002 27 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: It's been a long time since I last worked with others. It's not so bad.
Media:vo hyeq002 27 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: If the opportunity arises, let's team up again in the future.
Media:vo hyeq002 27 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: All thanks to the power of teamwork!
Media:vo hyeq002 27 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: See, even Captain Pyro needs his trusty sidekicks sometimes. It can't be Master Diluc saving the day by himself every single time. Many hands make light work!
Media:vo hyeq002 4 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: You're here? You move fast.
Media:vo hyeq002 4 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: What are you agonizing over?
Media:vo hyeq002 4 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: There's no need to be nervous.
Media:vo hyeq002 4 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: ...And I can see from the looks on your faces that they've grabbed your interest.
Media:vo hyeq002 4 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: These letters deal with events that are past and gone. I only held onto them in case any of the information they contain proves useful later down the line.
Media:vo hyeq002 4 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: I just dug them out to confirm a few details, I've been following some rather unique developments recently.
Media:vo hyeq002 4 diluc 07.ogg Diluc: You were involved in the events in question anyway. You can read them if you want to. It's not a bad thing to be curious.
Media:vo hyeq002 4 diluc 08.ogg Diluc: ...
Media:vo hyeq002 4 diluc 09.ogg Diluc: Very perceptive. Yes, I did make a trip to the Stormbearer Mountains.
Media:vo hyeq002 4 diluc 10.ogg Diluc: I'll fill you in later.
Media:vo hyeq002 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa, there are so many letters here.
Media:vo hyeq002 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It looks like Diluc read them just before he left. He must have been in a hurry...
Media:vo hyeq002 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Adelinde asked us to put this one at the top of the pile, but how are we supposed to tell the order of the other ones?
Media:vo hyeq002 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Guess we'll have to read them to get an idea of when they came in.
Media:vo hyeq002 4 paimon 05a.ogg Paimon: That's true. In that case, let's just tidy them up a little.
Media:vo hyeq002 4 paimon 05b.ogg Paimon: Bad idea? Yeah, you're probably right... Okay, let's just tidy them up a little.
Media:vo hyeq002 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Whoa! There he is!
Media:vo hyeq002 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Ms. Adelinde asked us to put these letters in a pile, and we can't tell which order they should go in...
Media:vo hyeq002 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: But it's your personal mail, so it'd be rude for us to read them without your permission.
Media:vo hyeq002 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Hey, that's a good point... Actually, you kinda smell like wild mountain fruit... Oh! Did you go to those mountains where the Valberries come from?
Media:vo hyeq002 4 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: No fair! We still have some super important things to discuss with Diluc... not to mention a whole bunch of questions!
Media:vo hyeq002 4 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Ugh... Alright, let's just sort these letters for him.
Media:vo hyeq002 4 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Well, since he said he doesn't mind, why don't we read them as we go?
Media:vo hyeq002 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh, Paimon's not sure what this one's about...
Media:vo hyeq002 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Shall we read another one, (Traveler)?
Media:vo hyeq002 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Do you want to keep reading them? Or have you got the gist now, (Traveler)?
Media:vo hyeq002 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Okay. Remember, we're trying to figure out when each letter was written.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Is there a problem?
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: "Old outfit"? You've seen it before?
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Huh. I'm surprised it made such an impression.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: The same reason as ever. Just stopping another Abyss Order plot.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: They launched an offensive on several fronts at once. Unfortunately for them, they were still no match for me.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: We were fighting in an area on Falcon Coast, and everything was recorded by the unusually active ley lines.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 07.ogg Diluc: They must have become unstable again recently, causing them to let out all kinds of information from that time. Hence why you saw what you saw.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 08.ogg Diluc: For starters, you only need to deal with the monsters and the ley line deposit will stay dormant, as long as it isn't disturbed again.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 09.ogg Diluc: On the other hand, if I'd done nothing at all, the Knights of Favonius would have taken over straight away. Knowing how they work, they'd be sure to send a large contingent to guard the site.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 10.ogg Diluc: Depends. Most of the knights are away on expeditions, so they don't have a lot of people to spare.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 11.ogg Diluc: If the ley line anomaly was just a diversion tactic, the Abyss Order could have been poised to attack somewhere else entirely, while the knights were scrambling to send what limited forces they have to Falcon Coast.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 12.ogg Diluc: But anyway, I have no interest in talking to the Knights of Favonius. I prefer to get to the bottom of things myself rather than waste time negotiating with them.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 13.ogg Diluc: And it was easy enough for me find out the Abyss Order's plans. Take a few Abyss Mages hostage, and they soon start talking.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 14.ogg Diluc: As for the Knights of Favonius, I've sent someone to enlist their cooperation where it's needed.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 15.ogg Diluc: It's their job to handle situations like this. They ought to be present when things come to a head.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 16.ogg Diluc: I don't like working closely with the Knights of Favonius because of our differences in philosophy, but that doesn't mean we can't watch each others' backs when it counts.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 17.ogg Diluc: The best way to deal with any threat is to utilize all the force at your disposal.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 18.ogg Diluc: Anyway, thank you for your help, Adelinde brought me up to speed with everything. In return, I have a gift for your trouble.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 19.ogg Diluc: This is my personal favorite grape juice, made of the highest-quality grapes. I happened to have an unopened batch, so I brought you a bottle to try.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 20.ogg Diluc: I didn't know you were such fans of grape juice. Next time you want some, don't bother waiting for the discount â€” just go down to the cellar and help yourselves.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 21.ogg Diluc: It's on the house.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 22.ogg Diluc: Haha... If you're free tonight, you're welcome to stay for dinner. Adelinde is already making it.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 23.ogg Diluc: There are, however, a few things I need to take care of before dinnertime.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 24.ogg Diluc: Yes. Passiveness is not my style.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 25.ogg Diluc: Though I had my suspicions at the start, everything I've come across so far in my investigation suggests that the Abyss Order was not behind this.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 26.ogg Diluc: Since this arose from natural causes, it's time to wrap things up.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 27.ogg Diluc: ...
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 28.ogg Diluc: Well said.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 diluc 29.ogg Diluc: In that case, let's get going.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Alright then, let's put the letters in the right order.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: If there's one thing we can take away from these, it's that Master Diluc has had a pretty difficult past...
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Not only was he misunderstood by the Knights of Favonius, but he's faced all kinds of other obstacles, too...
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Sounds like it's tough being Captain Pyro.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Always fighting alone, because for one reason or another, it wasn't convenient for the people around him to help out.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Yeah, that's true.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Plus, he's got us now. We can give him all the help he could ever want!
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Oh â€” out of friendship, of course! Definitely not just for the grape juice!
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Wait... what?
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Master Diluc... you're wearing your old outfit again? And you've tied your hair back...
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: You look so formal all of a sudden!
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Yep, it was by that ley line anomaly... That was your past self, right?
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Do you mind telling us about it? What happened back then? Why were you fighting there?
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Wouldn't that have been a good thing?
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Whoa... seems like you have even more control over things now than you used to, Diluc.
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Grape juice?
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: The packaging is so fancy! It must be really expensive?
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Woohoo! Paimon's gonna tell everyone we meet that we're VIPs at Dawn Winery!
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: This one bottle must be worth at least... like, fifty thousand Mora? Hee-hee, and he gave it to us for free...!
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: Thank you, Master Diluc!
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 21.ogg Paimon: (Traveler)... Um, so what should we do...?
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 22.ogg Paimon: Right, sure! After all, he did just give us this amazing grape juice...
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 23.ogg Paimon: Wait, no... what was it... After all, "even when the odds of success are nine to one, you must never lower your guard."
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 24.ogg Paimon: Okie-Dokey, Captain Pyro! You can take it a little easier this time!
Media:vo hyeq002 7 paimon 25.ogg Paimon: Come on, let's go! This is the final battle, then we can put all this trouble behind us!
