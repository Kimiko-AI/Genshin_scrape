 (It feels like he's just leaving her high and dry...)
 ...
 Any adverse side effects?
 Can you eat that, I wonder?
 Four times? Sounds tasty.
 Hey there. It's us again.
 I'm curious about Albedo's secret stash myself.
 If the lady wishes it, we shall do it.
 Into forging, are you?
 Is smithing part of an alchemist's qualifications, too?
 Quest DescriptionAfter your journey up Dragonspine, you and Paimon prepare to head back to the adventurer camp in the foothills to have a look. There, you meet Sucrose, who asks for your help in investigating Albedo's "secret."
 Sucrose has commissioned us to probe you for secrets.
 Sucrose says that you conceal some unspeakable secret.
 To think that a human could make such a weapon...
 Wait, you're the thief they were talking about?
 Well, we weren't fooling him either way.
 You didn't filch anything from them, did you?
 You're giving it to me?
Media:vo dialog eqxs001 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Albedo's secret must be something truly extraordinary. But if that's the case, why the secrecy in the first place?
Media:vo eqxs001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? Look at that, (Traveler)! Looks like someone made camp here. Are other people adventuring nearby?
Media:vo eqxs001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's see how our fellow explorers are doing?
Media:vo eqxs001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, it's Sucrose!
Media:vo eqxs001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Are you here to explore the Snowy Mountain too?
Media:vo eqxs001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: But you were standing over there, staring in to space...
Media:vo eqxs001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Yeah, weren't you doing research in the city? How come you're here?
Media:vo eqxs001 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Sure didn't.
Media:vo eqxs001 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Secrets? Ooh, what secrets?
Media:vo eqxs001 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Don't have anything on us but that!
Media:vo eqxs001 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: But isn't he your teacher? What would a teacher have to hide from his students?
Media:vo eqxs001 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Wait. How're you so sure?
Media:vo eqxs001 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Hmm... You do have a point.
Media:vo eqxs001 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Hmm... What do you think?
Media:vo eqxs001 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Alright, alright. Let's take a little trip, shall we?
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Aah! Y—You scared me... Please, don't scare me like that! I was giving my research report some much-needed consideration.
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: N—Not at all! I was just thinking of a name for a new subspecies of Sweet Flower I propagated. It has seeds that are four times as large as normal.
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Oh, are you interested? Wonderful! Next time, please allow me to show you the fruits of my work!
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: It's a shame. If I wasn't coming to this mountain, I would've brought some samples with me...
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: Timaeus and I were helping Albedo organize research data. Timaeus just left in fact. You didn't run into him?
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: He said that he wasn't as sharp as Albedo when it came to data — by quite a long shot, in fact.
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: The significance of some things Albedo is able to grasp almost immediately, but we on the other hand take considerable time. I fear that this must be the difference in our knowledge and experience showing...
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: Timaeus seemed rather depressed about the matter. He said he was going to take a walk, so I'm currently settling the leftover affairs myself.
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: I was originally going to take a look around myself after finishing up here, but unexpectedly, I gleaned some interesting data from these reports!
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 10.ogg Sucrose: But, well... *sigh* Guess my search for secrets will have to wait...
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 11.ogg Sucrose: Hmm... Actually, do you two have time right now?
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 12.ogg Sucrose: Then could I ask you for a favor? In truth, I feel like Albedo is... concealing something from myself and Timaeus.
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 13.ogg Sucrose: That's true, but I feel like he's always hiding something... It is my personal guess that it is some great secret of alchemy!
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 14.ogg Sucrose: Timaeus and I are both passionate researchers of alchemy. If it was anything else, Albedo wouldn't have an reason to hide it from us.
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 15.ogg Sucrose: Could you help me investigate what it is that Albedo's hiding? Please! I'm... I'm just too curious!
Media:vo eqxs001 2 sucrose 16.ogg Sucrose: Yes! Thank you, thank you!
Media:vo eqxs001 4 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Hmm? Why are you here?
Media:vo eqxs001 4 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Are you lost?
Media:vo eqxs001 4 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: A secret?
Media:vo eqxs001 4 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: Actually, you've arrived at just the right moment. I have business with you too, in fact.
Media:vo eqxs001 4 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: Here you go.
Media:vo eqxs001 4 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: As you can see, it is a sword.
Media:vo eqxs001 4 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: I did not make this sword. However, I did add some alchemical touches to it.
Media:vo eqxs001 4 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: Would you like to try it out?
Media:vo eqxs001 4 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: My research indicates that this sword has some... unique properties. Only you can use it.
Media:vo eqxs001 4 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: But I need to gather data from it quite urgently — so, could I bother you to use it in battle?
Media:vo eqxs001 4 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: Very astute of you. This sword has indeed had a curse laid upon it.
Media:vo eqxs001 4 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: An ordinary person would be unable to wield it at all. However, you are an exception.
Media:vo eqxs001 4 albedo 13.ogg Albedo: Or perhaps I should say that only you are immune to the curse. As such, who could I find to help me, of not you?
Media:vo eqxs001 4 albedo 14.ogg Albedo: We gain little from saying more. Go find some monsters nearby — after all, some things are best discovered through practice.
Media:vo eqxs001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Albedo!
Media:vo eqxs001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: No we're not!
Media:vo eqxs001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hey! What are you doing!?
Media:vo eqxs001 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Our mission calls for a delicate approach!
Media:vo eqxs001 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Uh... Sure, but still...
Media:vo eqxs001 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Huh? What's this?
Media:vo eqxs001 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Waaait a second. How can there be a sword that only one person can use?
Media:vo eqxs001 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Huh...?
Media:vo eqxs001 6 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: How about those over there?
Media:vo eqxs001 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Paimon still has a bad feeling about this...
Media:vo eqxs001 7 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Watch out!
Media:vo eqxs001 7 fierceman 01.ogg Ferocious Man: Over here! It's with this brat!
Media:vo eqxs001 7 fierceman 02.ogg Ferocious Man: Give it back, you thief!
Media:vo eqxs001 7 fierceman 03.ogg Ferocious Man: Enough talk! Hand it over!
Media:vo eqxs001 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Treasure Hoarders? There are Treasure Hoarders in a place this cold?
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: They certainly arrived quickly.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Goodness, no.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Why are you looking at me like that? Of course I didn't steal this sword.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: Not long ago, the Knights caught a band of Treasure Hoarders outside the city. The goods they were smuggling were also impounded.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: This sword was one of those items. We believed it to be stolen plunder, but no one came to claim it, nor could we find out where it came from, so it languished in our stores.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: I noticed it quite by chance while in our storehouse. To tell you the truth such an old sword would see little use outside of alchemy.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: Indeed, and I initially intended to perform some experiments on it, but I unexpectedly discovered its true origins in the process.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: This ancient-looking weapon once passed through the hands of a now-deceased blacksmith. It is a legendary magical sword.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: It is said that the smith vanished not long after creating this weapon, with the weapon subsequently becoming lost to time.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: Working backwards from its eventual fate as plunder, one can correctly guess that it was then stolen by the Treasure Hoarders, where it remained in obscurity till recently.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: Exactly.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: Do you know the story of Durin and this mountain?
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 13.ogg Albedo: Durin was the black dragon who menaced Mondstadt, before finally being defeated by the combined efforts of Dvalin and the Anemo Archon Barbatos.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 14.ogg Albedo: After a fierce battle, the vanquished Durin crashed to ruin here, falling into the thick snow.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 15.ogg Albedo: Snow gathers atop this mountain and never melts, which is a most curious phenomenon. Which leads one to wonder — was Durin's fall here purely by chance, or was it intent?
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 16.ogg Albedo: Perhaps this place was chosen as a gravesite precisely so that the snow's power could seal the corrosive toxin coming from Durin's body.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 17.ogg Albedo: It seems plausible that Barbatos would think of such a method.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 18.ogg Albedo: Well, these are just my postulations. I don't have any evidence. But what's for certain is that this mountain and Durin are deeply intertwined.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 19.ogg Albedo: In fact, I believe that the very sword in your hand has Durin's remains in it.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 20.ogg Albedo: Indeed. The dragon's eyes, claws, and scales, ground into dust before being used to coat the blade.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 21.ogg Albedo: In this way, Durin's corruption and venom entered into the sword, and became the source of its power.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 22.ogg Albedo: This is very advanced craftsmanship. I presume that having successfully forged the weapon, the smith must have tried it out themselves in their joy.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 23.ogg Albedo: But using this sword in battle would have allowed the corruption to seep through the blade's handle, and into their bodies.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 24.ogg Albedo: Ordinary mortals cannot withstand such power. The blacksmith must then have fled, driven mad by the curse, before meeting their end in some unknown place.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 25.ogg Albedo: You've purified Dvalin's Tears before, which is a very rare ability indeed.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 26.ogg Albedo: This ability has protected you from being corrupted or poisoned, and you can completely eliminate their effects.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 27.ogg Albedo: Which is why you, and only you, can properly wield this sword.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 28.ogg Albedo: As far as I'm concerned, this is where the real experiment begins.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 29.ogg Albedo: The sword is still very week at present. However, it is able to absorb energy, and through that, it is able to constantly become stronger.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 30.ogg Albedo: In some sense, you could even say that it is a living thing.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 31.ogg Albedo: Well then, Traveler, adventure with it to your heart's content. I need you to help it grow.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 albedo 32.ogg Albedo: I believe that we will soon have all the proof we need.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Now that's rich — Treasure Hoarders calling us thieves!
Media:vo eqxs001 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: They seem to have been talking about this sword. What's going on?
Media:vo eqxs001 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Eh? You claimed it for yourself, just like that?
Media:vo eqxs001 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: So... then what happened? You just took it with you?
Media:vo eqxs001 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: A magical sword!?
Media:vo eqxs001 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: The blacksmith who made this weapon... disappeared!? That's kinda spooky.
Media:vo eqxs001 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: No wonder its cursed!
Media:vo eqxs001 9 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Could it really have been intent?
Media:vo eqxs001 9 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Huh... Was Barbatos such a capable god?
Media:vo eqxs001 9 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: A dragon's remains!?
Media:vo eqxs001 9 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Eek...
Media:vo eqxs001 9 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Still, this sword really is huge... Yikes!
Media:vo eqxs001 9 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: I—It's glowing!
