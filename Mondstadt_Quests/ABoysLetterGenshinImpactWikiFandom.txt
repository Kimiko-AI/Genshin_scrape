 ...Just Dandelions?
 A letter for you, from Draff.
 About the letter...
 About the letter...
Draff: ...It's about something that happened a long time ago. I take it you didn't read it last time, then?
Draff: Don't bother reading it. It's boring and long-winded.
 Are you feeding the pigeons?
Timmie: I fed them already today. And I got them to fly away earlier, so they would be safe... from you.
Timmie: Now I'm writing a letter.
 Burn it.
Draff: Hahaha... That's the adventurer in you talking! Decisive and efficient in all things.
Draff: I'm no adventurer myself. Just a plain old hunter.
Draff: I'm not going to burn this, or even open it. I'm just going to hold onto it for now.
 Got them.
 I can't promise anything...
Grace: Ugh, you are insufferable...
Grace: ...But go on then.
 I promise.
 Let me keep it.
Draff: What for? Surely you don't think my old friend might still be alive...
Draff: ...Somewhere, out there, just waiting to be found...
Draff: Yes, I used to wonder the same thing myself. Even put it to the test, but...
Draff: In the end I just had accept the facts — my best friend is gone forever, never to return.
 Okay.
Draff: Thank you.
 Okay.
Grace: Wonderful, thanks.
 Okay... just don't send it?
Draff: Well, yes... As much as I'd like to, I simply can't.
Draff: There's nothing I can do. I suppose I'll just hold onto it for now.
 Please continue...
 Quest DescriptionDraff of Springvale seems to be fretting over a letter...
 Sure.
Timmie: Yay! Thank you! ...So you ARE nice sometimes...
 Timmie wants you to send this letter to his daddy.
 What are you doing?
Timmie: Writing a letter to Daddy.
 What's so bad about knowing the truth?
Grace: Hmm... Well, it makes sense for someone like you to think that way. You've been through a lot already, which has given you courage and resilience.
Grace: I have no doubt that whatever has shaped you into who you are today, it must have included some very painful experiences.
Grace: But Timmie is still so young. Maybe it is out of my own selfishness, but I won't have him taking on more than he can bear.
Grace: ...At the very least, I want him to have a happy childhood.
 What's wrong?
 Who's the kid?
Draff: If you must know, I mean that little boy who's always feeding the pigeons on the bridge.
Draff: Yes, Timmie. For certain reasons... it would be best if I avoided him at the moment.
Draff: Happy now? Now quickly, get this letter to Grace before she starts fretting.
 Why me?
Draff: Well, I'm hardly going to trust those pigeons with it after what happened last time.
Draff: Also, if I take the letter to Mondstadt myself, I'll have to face that kid...
Draff: *sigh* Don't ask... Just... Please. Do this for me.
 Why not do it yourself?
Grace: It's awkward, but... Although I keep saying to myself I won't tell him the truth...
Grace: ...Every time I hear him say he wants to write a letter to his father, my heart goes out to him.
Grace: I'm worried that one day I won't be able to stop myself from telling him the whole story
Grace: ...I won't let that happen.
Grace: So please go and check up on Timmie on my behalf.
 You can't hide it from him forever.
Grace: I know that, I do... But he's just so young...
Grace: I just hope... No, I insist that he has the chance of a happy childhood.
Grace: That way, whatever awful things he might experience in life, at the very least he will have some fond memories to look back on.
 You don't want Timmie to know the truth?
Grace: Correct. He's still just a child... I don't think it's wise to tell him everything.
Grace: As much as he says he's a big boy now, and even helps me look after Nora and Glory...
Grace: ...I'm just not sure he could cope with all the gruesome details. It's too much.
Grace: Maybe when he's older. But for now...
Grace: I'd rather he has the chance of a happy childhood. Even if that means not being completely honest with him.
Draff: *sigh* Don't ask... Just... Please. Do this for me.
Draff: *sigh* I wonder how the kid's getting along...
Draff: ...I thought you were supposed to be delivering my letter?
Draff: ...It's about something that happened a long time ago. I take it you didn't read it last time, then?
Draff: ...Somewhere, out there, just waiting to be found...
Draff: Also, if I take the letter to Mondstadt myself, I'll have to face that kid...
Draff: Anyway, enough about that. I will keep the letter. Please consider it sent.
Draff: Don't bother reading it. It's boring and long-winded.
Draff: Hahaha... That's the adventurer in you talking! Decisive and efficient in all things.
Draff: Happy now? Now quickly, get this letter to Grace before she starts fretting.
Draff: He would understand... My dear old friend.
Draff: Hmm...? Oh, hi. Perfect timing, do you still remember that letter from last time?
Draff: I'm no adventurer myself. Just a plain old hunter.
Draff: I'm not going to burn this, or even open it. I'm just going to hold onto it for now.
Draff: I... I can't send this.
Draff: If you can spare the time, please deliver this letter to Grace for me.
Draff: If you must know, I mean that little boy who's always feeding the pigeons on the bridge.
Draff: In the end I just had accept the facts — my best friend is gone forever, never to return.
Draff: Thank you.
Draff: Thanks for your help and please, please don't tell Timmie about this. I can trust you with that, right? ...Considering, here's your payment...
Draff: There's nothing I can do. I suppose I'll just hold onto it for now.
Draff: Timmie's still writing letters to his father... I assume you heard the whole story from Grace.
Draff: Well, I'm hardly going to trust those pigeons with it after what happened last time.
Draff: Well, yes... As much as I'd like to, I simply can't.
Draff: What for? Surely you don't think my old friend might still be alive...
Draff: Yes, I used to wonder the same thing myself. Even put it to the test, but...
Draff: Yes, Timmie. For certain reasons... it would be best if I avoided him at the moment.
Draff: You're back? Did you deliver the letter?
Grace: ...At the very least, I want him to have a happy childhood.
Grace: ...But go on then.
Grace: ...Every time I hear him say he wants to write a letter to his father, my heart goes out to him.
Grace: ...Except that once in a while, when they just couldn't bear it anymore, they'd meet up and binge drink apple cider. I joined them for a drink too, once or twice.
Grace: ...I won't let that happen.
Grace: ...I'm just not sure he could cope with all the gruesome details. It's too much.
Grace: ...Lord Barbatos, if you've been watching...
Grace: ...Please tell me what I'm supposed to do.
Grace: ...Something happened to the pigeons? Goodness. Never a dull day in Springvale.
Grace: ...Timmie's father is good friends with Draff. They do everything together — hunting, drinking, causing all sorts of trouble...
Grace: As much as he says he's a big boy now, and even helps me look after Nora and Glory...
Grace: But Timmie is still so young. Maybe it is out of my own selfishness, but I won't have him taking on more than he can bear.
Grace: But although it was long ago, it's something we will never forget.
Grace: But these days, he's so sullen and lifeless all the time.
Grace: Correct. He's still just a child... I don't think it's wise to tell him everything.
Grace: Draff brought him here as quickly as he could, and we did everything within our power to save him... But sadly, he didn't make it.
Grace: Each month he sends a letter and some money. But he can't face seeing Timmie.
Grace: Finally, when Timmie was born, his father reined it in. Went teetotal and everything. Started working hard to provide for his family and "set an example" for his son, as he puts it.
Grace: He became so obsessed with not setting a bad example for Timmie that he even managed to get Draff to give up alcohol.
Grace: Hmm... Well, it makes sense for someone like you to think that way. You've been through a lot already, which has given you courage and resilience.
Grace: Hmm? What are you doing here? You're not a carrier pigeon...
Grace: I don't know how many times they've been warned by the Knights. Or been lectured by Sister Victoria.
Grace: I have no doubt that whatever has shaped you into who you are today, it must have included some very painful experiences.
Grace: I just hope... No, I insist that he has the chance of a happy childhood.
Grace: I know that, I do... But he's just so young...
Grace: I won't deny that Timmie is growing up, though. He's increasingly curious, and asks more and more questions...
Grace: I'd rather he has the chance of a happy childhood. Even if that means not being completely honest with him.
Grace: I'm worried that one day I won't be able to stop myself from telling him the whole story
Grace: If you have the time, could you check up on Timmie for me?
Grace: It's awkward, but... Although I keep saying to myself I won't tell him the truth...
Grace: It's getting more and more difficult for me to face him.
Grace: Maybe when he's older. But for now...
Grace: Nora says Timmie always used to drag her out into the wild, saying he wanted to make a gift for his father or send a letter to him.
Grace: Oh, you read it? Not that it matters, it's nothing confidential.
Grace: Recently, he has started saying he wants to tell Timmie the truth about that fateful day... *sigh* I dread to think what he must have been through...
Grace: Since then, Draff's asked me to look after Timmie while he returns to Springvale to be a hunter.
Grace: So please go and check up on Timmie on my behalf.
Grace: Strange, it should be here by now... What if something's happened...
Grace: That way, whatever awful things he might experience in life, at the very least he will have some fond memories to look back on.
Grace: To put it in Draff's words, it's just something that happened a long time ago.
Grace: Ugh, you are insufferable...
Grace: Unfortunately, Timmie's father was seriously injured in a hunting accident one day...
Grace: Well, thanks for bringing the letter. One second, I've got a little something for you in return...
Grace: Wonderful, thanks.
Grace: You really want to know? Well, you seem trustworthy enough... But promise me you will keep it a secret.
Timmie: ...And we're all set! Yay! Daddy's going to be so happy when he gets my letter.
Timmie: ...I got it! Dandelions. Mommy says everyone in Mondstadt loves Dandelions.
Timmie: ...Still no news. Not even a word.
Timmie: Ah, it doesn't matter — as long as I get to help Daddy, I don't mind if it's busy.
Timmie: And Daddy works reeeeeally far away... The pigeon will have a long way to go already.
Timmie: And she also says that Mr. Draff knows Daddy. He must be able to send this letter.
Timmie: Anyway. Go get me some Dandelions! You promised. And I've nearly finished writing my letter.
Timmie: But I've waited and waited and I haven't had a single letter from him... Maybe Daddy's just too busy at work.
Timmie: But... I heard that you need to use a proper trained carrier pigeon when you wanna send a letter. And I don't know Daddy's address...
Timmie: But... Mommy also says that Mr. Draff and Daddy are both very busy in their work... Hmm, I wonder if I'll be busy like them when I grow up...
Timmie: Did you get my Dandelions?
Timmie: Do you have time to find me some Dandelions?
Timmie: I did wanna send something better, but if it's too heavy the pigeon won't be able to carry it.
Timmie: I fed them already today. And I got them to fly away earlier, so they would be safe... from you.
Timmie: In go the Dandelion Seeds... now I seal the envelope...
Timmie: Mommy says Daddy and him are best friends. He's sure to know how to get this letter to Daddy.
Timmie: Mommy says that Daddy will send a letter by pigeon when he has time.
Timmie: Now I'm writing a letter.
Timmie: Oh wait — I just remembered, Mommy says that Mr. Draff from Springvale keeps carrier pigeons.
Timmie: One more thing — no peeking!
