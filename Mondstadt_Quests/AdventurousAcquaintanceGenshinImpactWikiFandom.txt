 (Traveler)'s Adventure Team...
 ...You just want to stand there and watch?
 Are you sure it's okay to eat?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: I think so...? Should be... pretty much... basically the same as when I first came up with it. So... yup!
 Aren't you going to give me a hand!?
 As long as you don't cause too much trouble. (-1 heart)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 30.ogg Bennett: Oh, I, uh... I'll try, although most of the time it's completely out of my control...
 Can't wait!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 44.ogg Bennett: Awesome! I was worried that it wouldn't be your thing...
 Come on, I'm not as great as you make out...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 50.ogg Bennett: Don't be so modest! I've heard about all the great things you've done, not to mention the high praise you get from the Adventurers' Guild...
 Does defeating Stormterror count as an S-rank commission?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 58.ogg Bennett: Of course! Defeating Stormterror puts you on par with Guild Master Cyrus in my mind.
 How about a walk in the wild? (This dialogue option leads to What Is This, a Day Trip?.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 39.ogg Bennett: That's a good idea!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 40.ogg Bennett: For someone like me, I'm actually way more familiar with the wilderness than the city, especially around Mondstadt!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 41.ogg Bennett: I mean, I'm not on the same level as Fischl, who is also in the Adventurers' Guild. But that's expected, because she works in the Intelligence Department.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 42.ogg Bennett: Oh, I know this gorgeous place. It's sort of a dandelion-covered meadow.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 43.ogg Bennett: It's got a great Mondstadt feel. Do you want to check it out?
 Can't wait!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 44.ogg Bennett: Awesome! I was worried that it wouldn't be your thing...
 I can accompany you for a quick look. (-1 heart)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 45.ogg Bennett: Uh... okay, I'll try not to let you down, haha...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 46.ogg Bennett: Shall we?
(Proceed to What Is This, a Day Trip?)
 How about we hang out around town? (This dialogue option leads to Something... Other Than Adventure?.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 32.ogg Bennett: Cool, that would be nice! I was planning to stock up on some adventuring supplies anyway...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 33.ogg Bennett: Oh! Sorry, I'm back talking about adventuring again. You must think I'm so boring...
 It's okay, I like adventures too.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 34.ogg Bennett: Really!? Well, of course you do. You are a famous adventurer, after all.
 Let's change the topic. (-1)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 35.ogg Bennett: Oh, um... a—alright, haha...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 36.ogg Bennett: How about we go to the souvenir store?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 37.ogg Bennett: "With Wind Comes Glory" is my favorite shop ever. What can I say, Mondstadt's where I grew up.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 38.ogg Bennett: Let's go!
(Proceed to Something... Other Than Adventure?)
 I can accompany you for a quick look. (-1 heart)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 45.ogg Bennett: Uh... okay, I'll try not to let you down, haha...
 I do. (This dialogue option leads to Can't Make an Omelette Without Eggs.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 62.ogg Bennett: Hmm... the cautious choice. No wonder you're so good at this.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 63.ogg Bennett: Seems I really can learn a few things from you, hehe.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 64.ogg Bennett: In that case, as per your tradition, let's get cooking!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 65.ogg Bennett: Oh yeah — I actually invented a pretty nice dish recently!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 66.ogg Bennett: I can't say it's super tasty, but I think it'd be perfect for an adventure. So, how about I show you how to make it?
 Okay, how about I fetch the ingredients and you cook?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 67.ogg Bennett: Cool! I really miss that old feeling of working with a partner.
 Nice, and thank you!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 68.ogg Bennett: Oh wait till you see— Oh, uh... huh. Ingredients... seem to be in short supply, hehe...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 69.ogg Bennett: I'm really sorry... I probably need your help to get some.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 70.ogg Bennett: The ingredients needed for this dish are... Mint, Radish, and Slime Condensate. One of each, please.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 71.ogg Bennett: You got that, right? I'll wait for you near the pot at Good Hunter. Come find me when you're done collecting!
(Proceed to Can't Make an Omelette Without Eggs)
 I feel like this dish... reeks of misfortune.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: Huh? It's just an ordinary dish... hearing you say that is really kind of disappointing...
 I have my reasons...
 I'm looking forward to it.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 28.ogg Bennett: Really? Looking forward to hanging out with someone like me...?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 29.ogg Bennett: Seems like the rumors are all true! You really are a nice person able to bring people together, hehe.
 I've always wanted to go adventuring with you, too.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 51.ogg Bennett: Aw, shucks... hearing you say that has got me all flustered, hehe... but I'm happy to hear it!
 It won't bother me.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 27.ogg Bennett: That's good, that's good... I was afraid you'd back out.
 It's okay, I like adventures too.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 34.ogg Bennett: Really!? Well, of course you do. You are a famous adventurer, after all.
 Let me think about it.
 Let's change the topic. (-1)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 35.ogg Bennett: Oh, um... a—alright, haha...
 Nice to meet you, Bennett!
 Nice, and thank you!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 68.ogg Bennett: Oh wait till you see— Oh, uh... huh. Ingredients... seem to be in short supply, hehe...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 69.ogg Bennett: I'm really sorry... I probably need your help to get some.
 No, I usually leave straight away. (This dialogue option leads to Expansive Eya.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 72.ogg Bennett: Oh! I guess you're such a pro that you don't need to worry about that, huh? Awesome...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 73.ogg Bennett: Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!
(Proceed to Expansive Eya)
 Okay, how about I fetch the ingredients and you cook?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 67.ogg Bennett: Cool! I really miss that old feeling of working with a partner.
 Quest DescriptionYou make the acquaintance of a rather passionate adventurer at the front desk of the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild...
 Sure! Let's go on an adventure! (This dialogue option leads to Can't Make an Omelette Without Eggs or Expansive Eya.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 47.ogg Bennett: Really? I didn't mishear you, did I?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 48.ogg Bennett: You mean... go adventure with you, just like we'd do if I was on your adventure team?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 49.ogg Bennett: Wow! I never thought I'd get an opportunity like this!
 Come on, I'm not as great as you make out...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 50.ogg Bennett: Don't be so modest! I've heard about all the great things you've done, not to mention the high praise you get from the Adventurers' Guild...
 I've always wanted to go adventuring with you, too.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 51.ogg Bennett: Aw, shucks... hearing you say that has got me all flustered, hehe... but I'm happy to hear it!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 52.ogg Bennett: ...By the way, since we've got this rare chance to work together, let me share some recent intel with you!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 53.ogg Bennett: According to my friend Fischl in the guild, a mysterious and dangerous ruin has recently been discovered...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 54.ogg Bennett: Based on how the Guild ranks the difficulty of its commissions, it's probably ranked between a Rank B and a Rank A.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 55.ogg Bennett: Normally, I wouldn't feel confident about taking on this level of commission...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 56.ogg Bennett: After all, with my poor luck, it's safer for me to take on commissions that are a few notches lower than my actual ability, haha.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 57.ogg Bennett: But since you'll be joining me this time, it'll be a peace of cake, right?
 Does defeating Stormterror count as an S-rank commission?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 58.ogg Bennett: Of course! Defeating Stormterror puts you on par with Guild Master Cyrus in my mind.
 Would stealing the Holy Lyre Del Himmel count as an S-rank commission?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 59.ogg Bennett: There's no way the Guild would issue an illegal commission like that!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 60.ogg Bennett: Heh... By the way, this ruin might be a dangerous one, but that usually means there'll be some great treasure hidden inside. I can't wait!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 61.ogg Bennett: Oh, uh... do you usually make some food before you set out on an adventure?
 I do. (This dialogue option leads to Can't Make an Omelette Without Eggs.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 62.ogg Bennett: Hmm... the cautious choice. No wonder you're so good at this.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 63.ogg Bennett: Seems I really can learn a few things from you, hehe.

Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 73.ogg Bennett: Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!
(Proceed to Expansive Eya)
 That's just coincidence....
 We could just do something else instead. (This dialogue option leads to Something... Other Than Adventure? or What Is This, a Day Trip?.)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 19.ogg Bennett: Hmm? Something else?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 20.ogg Bennett: ...I guess you're right. Even just the chance to talk with you would be great, too. Yeah... let's forget about adventuring for now, hah...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 21.ogg Bennett: But, uh... what would we do instead?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 22.ogg Bennett: Apart from going on adventures... the only thing I do is take care of my dads in the Adventurers' Guild...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 23.ogg Bennett: So... I really can't think of anything else to do besides adventuring.
 Let me think about it.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 24.ogg Bennett: Alright! I feel like whatever we do, as long as you're involved, it'll be totally worth it!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 25.ogg Bennett: Uh... but don't forget, I'll be bringing my bad luck with me...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 26.ogg Bennett: So it probably won't be a very fun trip... haha...
 It won't bother me.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 27.ogg Bennett: That's good, that's good... I was afraid you'd back out.
 As long as you don't cause too much trouble. (-1 heart)
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 30.ogg Bennett: Oh, I, uh... I'll try, although most of the time it's completely out of my control...
 I'm looking forward to it.

Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 29.ogg Bennett: Seems like the rumors are all true! You really are a nice person able to bring people together, hehe.

 You are...?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: The name's Bennett. I'm your run-of-the-mill adventurer from Mondstadt!
 You're that excited to see me...?
 You... admire me?
Bennett cooks skillfully, but something doesn't feel right...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Ah, it's you! Didn't think I'd be running into you here... Hehe, I guess it's my lucky day...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: How're your adventures going lately? Did you come here to get a new commission from Katheryne, or to get paid?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: And where're you going after this? Bet you've got a really exciting adventure lined up, huh?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: The name's Bennett. I'm your run-of-the-mill adventurer from Mondstadt!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: Ah... I'm talking too much, aren't I... I'm sorry...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: I was just so excited to run into someone I admire so much... And, uh... maybe a little starstruck, too... haha...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: Of course! You're the mysterious Traveler, the hero who quelled the Stormterror crisis, and the leader of your own adventure team to boot!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: If I'm being honest... I'm totally jealous of all your achievements...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: Yeah, word's been spreading in adventurer circles for a long time now. Your adventure team shows up all over the continent...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: It might look like you're just handling a bunch of boring commissions, but then, as soon as something big goes down, you're always there!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 11.ogg Bennett: Anyway, I just really envy you. You're sort of like... the protagonist of this world, or something. Hahaha...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 12.ogg Bennett: Me, on the other hand, I'm just some unlucky guy. My adventure team even...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 13.ogg Bennett: Ah— never mind, I shouldn't get all down in the dumps in front of someone I admire. I should be open to see what I can learn!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 14.ogg Bennett: Speaking of which... I have a favor to ask...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 15.ogg Bennett: Um... When you go adventuring later, can I come and watch?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 16.ogg Bennett: Eh-hehe... Maybe you don't know. I'm a really unlucky person to have around...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 17.ogg Bennett: If you brought me along on an adventure, my bad luck would probably just screw everything up!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 18.ogg Bennett: I don't want to get you into any trouble, so just let me watch from the sidelines... that'd be good enough for me...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 19.ogg Bennett: Hmm? Something else?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 20.ogg Bennett: ...I guess you're right. Even just the chance to talk with you would be great, too. Yeah... let's forget about adventuring for now, hah...

Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 54.ogg Bennett: Based on how the Guild ranks the difficulty of its commissions, it's probably ranked between a Rank B and a Rank A.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 55.ogg Bennett: Normally, I wouldn't feel confident about taking on this level of commission...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 56.ogg Bennett: After all, with my poor luck, it's safer for me to take on commissions that are a few notches lower than my actual ability, haha.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 57.ogg Bennett: But since you'll be joining me this time, it'll be a peace of cake, right?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 58.ogg Bennett: Of course! Defeating Stormterror puts you on par with Guild Master Cyrus in my mind.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 59.ogg Bennett: There's no way the Guild would issue an illegal commission like that!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 60.ogg Bennett: Heh... By the way, this ruin might be a dangerous one, but that usually means there'll be some great treasure hidden inside. I can't wait!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 61.ogg Bennett: Oh, uh... do you usually make some food before you set out on an adventure?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 62.ogg Bennett: Hmm... the cautious choice. No wonder you're so good at this.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 63.ogg Bennett: Seems I really can learn a few things from you, hehe.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 64.ogg Bennett: In that case, as per your tradition, let's get cooking!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 65.ogg Bennett: Oh yeah — I actually invented a pretty nice dish recently!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 66.ogg Bennett: I can't say it's super tasty, but I think it'd be perfect for an adventure. So, how about I show you how to make it?
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 67.ogg Bennett: Cool! I really miss that old feeling of working with a partner.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 68.ogg Bennett: Oh wait till you see— Oh, uh... huh. Ingredients... seem to be in short supply, hehe...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 69.ogg Bennett: I'm really sorry... I probably need your help to get some.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 70.ogg Bennett: The ingredients needed for this dish are... Mint, Radish, and Slime Condensate. One of each, please.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904101 bennett 71.ogg Bennett: You got that, right? I'll wait for you near the pot at Good Hunter. Come find me when you're done collecting!

Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: It's done!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: I forgot the exact order you're supposed to add the ingredients in, but... it should be alright.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: I'll pack it up and leave it with you until we get to the ruins.
Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: I think so...? Should be... pretty much... basically the same as when I first came up with it. So... yup!
Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: Huh? It's just an ordinary dish... hearing you say that is really kind of disappointing...
Media:vo bntcop001 1904401 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: Well, now that the food is ready, let's head for those mysterious ruins!
