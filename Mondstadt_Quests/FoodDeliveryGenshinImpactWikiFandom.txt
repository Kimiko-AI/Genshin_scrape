Reckless Pallad: Yes, a long time ago! Took you long enough! There'll be no treasure left if I wait much longer.
Reckless Pallad: Mmm, this does smell delicious though...
Reckless Pallad: Well, I guess food is also a treasure worth waiting for. I'm sure I've got time to eat before treasure hunting.
Reckless Pallad: Thank you. Here's the cash.

 Order for delivery
 Quest DescriptionGood Hunter has a delivery service in order to fulfill customers' requests, but due to its popularity, the service is heavily understaffed. Sara is looking for someone to lend a hand.
 Sorry to bother you – did you order takeout?
 Takeout, get your takeout here...
 Your meal, ma'am.
 Your meal, sir.
Ernest: Aha! My Fried Radish Balls... and prepared just as I requested!
Ernest: Huh? Where did you come from? What do you want with me?
Ernest: Mmm... Yes, that rich eggy aroma just hits you straight away, but it's not overpowering thanks to the freshness of the carrot. I've missed my calling, should have been a chef!
Ernest: Mmm... Yes, the addition of eggs does indeed do wonders for the texture and aroma.
Ernest: Oh yeah! I know what I'm doing when it comes to food. *mwah!*
Ernest: Oh, and this is for you. Many thanks!
Lively Orlean: Can't be helped I suppose. Here's the money, take it back to Sara for me.
Lively Orlean: If I hadn't had such low blood sugar, I'd have taught them a lesson myself...
Lively Orlean: Mmm... Smells carroty and meaty... It's a shame it didn't get here sooner, I would have sent those slimes flying if I'd been fighting on a full stomach!
Lively Orlean: Thanks! Ugh, these slimes are such a pain.
Paimon: Hey! That was supposed to be for a customer... do you have no self-control? Go get another batch from Sara now. You'd better hope she's in a good mood!
Paimon: The food has gone cold, no one will want to eat this now! Go back and get a fresh batch from Sara — if you're lucky, she won't be too upset with you...
Reckless Pallad: I'm sure there's time for me to eat before treasure hunting.
Reckless Pallad: Mmm, this does smell delicious though...
Reckless Pallad: Takeout? Not mine.
Reckless Pallad: Thank you. Here's the cash.

Reckless Pallad: Where is the treasure hiding...
Reckless Pallad: Yes, a long time ago! Took you long enough! There'll be no treasure left if I wait much longer.
Sara: ...Don't give me that look, I know you're famished.
Sara: ...Oh, you're just here to eat, you say?
Sara: But I've lost the label for this Calla Lily Seafood Soup. All I know is that it's for someone in Springvale.
Sara: Could you take this Calla Lily Seafood Soup over to Springvale for me and find out who ordered it?
Sara: Ernest from the Dawn Winery often orders food from here to pair with his wine, and his orders always come with special requests.
Sara: Here, this Crab, Ham & Veggie Bake is for you. It's fresh out of the oven, eat it while it's hot.
Sara: Here, this Delicious Crab, Ham & Veggie Bake is for you. It's fresh out of the oven, eat it while it's hot.
Sara: Hey Traveler! What's happening—
Sara: I appreciate it!
Sara: I don't dare attempt the journey myself... Could you deliver this order to Orlean in Springvale for me?
Sara: I understand, really I do... But I promise you I will make you the best meal you ever tasted if you just lend me a hand first.
Sara: I'm counting on you!
Sara: It's ready! Now, get these Fried Radish Balls to Ernest, pronto!
Sara: Let me check... Perfect! Thanks!
Sara: Let me check... Yep! Thanks!
Sara: Let's see... Excellent! Thank you.
Sara: Miss Orlean from Springvale ordered a Sticky Honey Roast, but I hear Springvale's crawling with slimes these days...
Sara: Once you've done what I ask, I'll treat you to something from the Good Hunter special menu! Much obliged.
Sara: Rest assured there'll be a hearty meal waiting for you on your return!
Sara: So if you could just go ahead and grab me a couple of Bird Eggs, that would be great.
Sara: Sorry, I know you must be hungry – but could you do something for me?
Sara: Sorry, I know you must be hungry — but could you do something for me?
Sara: That'll do it. One moment...
Sara: There must be plenty around Windrise.
Sara: There must be plenty of Bird Eggs around Windrise.
Sara: There'll be a special Good Hunter surprise waiting for you when you get back!
Sara: There's been a steady increase in volume of delivery orders recently. I tend to divide them up by region and then label each dish with the name of the person who ordered it.
Sara: This time he wants Fried Radish Balls but with egg added in. Unfortunately, I'm fresh out of eggs!
Sara: Traveler! Perfect timing...
Sara: Welcome to Good Hunter— Oh, hello Traveler! You've come just at the right time.
Sara: You're back! Did the delivery go okay?
Sara: You're back! Did you make the delivery?
Sara: You're back! Did you manage to deliver it?
Terrified Schuster: Here's what I owe you. Mmm, smells gooood!
Terrified Schuster: I did! ...Oh, but this one isn't mine.
Terrified Schuster: I mustn't go adventuring on an empty stomach. Now, I'm going to savor every last bite of this...
Terrified Schuster: I wonder if there's anywhere safe to go adventuring...
Terrified Schuster: Once I've finished eating I can get on with my adventure...
Terrified Schuster: Wow, that was fast. I thought it would take longer.
Timid Morrow: Any later and Draff would have dragged me out on a hunt by now.
Timid Morrow: I wish every day didn't have to be a hunting day...
Timid Morrow: Ugh, whatever. Here's your money. Now get outta here, let me eat my food in peace.
Timid Morrow: Um... Not this, this one isn't mine.
Timid Morrow: Um... is it Calla Lily Seafood Soup?
Timid Morrow: Yay, it is mine then. But I'm not sure what took you so long...
Timid Morrow: Yikes... I need to eat up, Draff has nearly finished drinking.
