 Even more so than before, I'd say.
 Quest DescriptionSusan, who has just arrived in Sumeru, seems to be looking for some help...
 Sure.
 What are you doing?
Susan: Ah, the very thought of being trapped in one place for so long... I told my husband that we should visit various places here in Sumeru to relax a little...
Susan: Ah, wonderful. My beauty is indeed as radiant as ever, hahaha!
Susan: Alright then, I'm counting on you, Traveler.
Susan: And wouldn't you know it? No one was available to help me take some photographs. I had wanted to take some photos for my husband to see as well.
Susan: But he claimed that he was far too busy clearing his work backlog. He would not go out the door for the world! So there we go — that's why I'm here all by my lonesome.
Susan: But since you're here, Traveler, may I ask you to help me take some pictures?
Susan: Come! This is your reward for pictures of me. Here you go!
Susan: Have you finished taking the pictures? Let me have a look at them.
Susan: How will this angle do? Should it be a bit more centered?
Susan: My husband and I were stuck in Inazuma for such a long time due to the Sakoku Decree. But those days are over — we were finally able to travel to Sumeru!
Susan: Oh, are you the Traveler? Great! I was just looking for someone to help me out.
Susan: Oh, you and your silver tongue! Still, thank you, Traveler.
Susan: Okay, I'm ready now!
Susan: The scenery here is rather lovely. If only someone was around to take a picture for me...
