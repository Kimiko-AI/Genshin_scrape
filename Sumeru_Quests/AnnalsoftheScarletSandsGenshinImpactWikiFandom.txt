 But Deshret's Relics haven't been the only victims of your revenge.
 But by that same token, he should have also stopped asking you for materials.
 Can you try to believe in him... just one more time?
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 17b 1.ogg Dehya: I don't know, I really don't know... I don't think I can do it.
 Do you have any idea the amount of damage you've done?
 I'm on your side, Dehya.
 If your trust hasn't been misplaced...
 It was all motivated by revenge...
 Kusayla thought there was no escaping the records.
 Maybe there's another way of looking at all of this...
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 17a 1.ogg Dehya: Another way? I dunno... I knew him, and he was nothing more than a childish brute. I can't understand what's going through his head.
 No, I made a promise to Dunyarzad to support you.
 Quest DescriptionDuring your investigation, you accidentally stumbled upon Dunyarzad's father's name. After discussing the matter with Dehya, she decides that Dunyarzad should be informed of all that has transpired...
 Responding to violence with more violence will only cause more pain.
 So that's why they turned on each other...
 So you mean...
 Step DescriptionAs it turns out, Dehya's and Dunyarzad's fathers were old acquaintances. Desperate to keep Dehya from the life of a mercenary, her father worked himself to the bone. Yet, his repeated acts of savagery remain a mystery...
 That feels unlikely, though.
 That's what things are looking like at this point.
 Then he probably has many conflicting feelings as well.
 True friendship is built on trust.
Dehya explains the issue to Shahzaman, and admits her doubts to him.
Dehya manages to explain the results of the investigation to Dunyarzad.
Media:vo dhylq001 1 dunyarzad 23a.ogg Dunyarzad: (I sure hope they'll be okay...)
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: We're back, my lady.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Actually, we are still investigating. It's just that... we've discovered something strange.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Something like that, yeah.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: It's okay, my lady, it's not so much about me being upset with my father or anything like that... Ugh, how should I put this...
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: My lady, please prepare yourself for what we're going to tell you next. It concerns the master...
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: Yeah. It makes as little sense to us as it does to you.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: I've never doubted the master's integrity, so I'm having a real hard time rationalizing how he could ever support an infamous brigade like them.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: Maybe he's not actually aware of the full story, and just stumbled into the deal by accident...
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: Ah, about that... well, the Homyanis [sic] really needed bodyguards, so they reached out to the Blazing Beasts.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: Later, the master told me that I was one of the best mercenaries he'd ever seen, and that I should stick around to become one of his bodyguards.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 11.ogg Dehya: He offered me a pile of Mora, so I just signed on...
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 12.ogg Dehya: Err, maybe the Corps of Thirty just didn't have anyone available? Or maybe someone recommended us? I've never given it too much thought...
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 13.ogg Dehya: ...I think I get what you're saying. You think none of this was a coincidence.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 14.ogg Dehya: No no no, that's too much of a stretch. I cut all my ties with my father a long time ago. He has no control over my life anymore.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 15.ogg Dehya: Hmm...
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 16.ogg Dehya: So... the master was not likely an innocent victim in all of this?
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 17.ogg Dehya: But is that... really the right thing to do?
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 18.ogg Dehya: My father has committed many atrocities, and deserves all the punishment that he has coming to him. I have zero sympathy for him. You may call me an ungrateful child, but my feelings will remain the same.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 19.ogg Dehya: However... the Homayani family has treated me with nothing but generosity and kindness.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 20.ogg Dehya: If we decide to investigate this further, we could end up implicating the entire Homayani family. I would be biting the hand that's fed me over all these years...
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 21.ogg Dehya: You don't have to do that, my lady. I'm not conflicted because I'm afraid of taking responsibility... Besides, you're the one we should all be worried about right now.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 22.ogg Dehya: Thank you, everyone. That makes a lot of sense. I guess I should always remember the trust that I've placed in people.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dehya 23.ogg Dehya: In which case... my lady, could you ask the master to come out and have a chat with us?
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: Ah, you're back a lot sooner than I expected! You mustn't have run into any trouble, then. Well, how did it go? What did you come up with?
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: I see... the clues you found have led you back here in the city?
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: You all look a little dispirited. Whatever you found must not have been very encouraging after all.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 05.ogg Dunyarzad: Why don't you discuss it with me? Maybe I'll be able to say something to cheer you up.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 06.ogg Dunyarzad: So something IS wrong. Even the Traveler and Paimon have been uncharacteristically quiet...
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 07.ogg Dunyarzad: On any other day, Paimon would have already waved to me with a smile and shouted "Dunyarzad, we're baaaack!"
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 08.ogg Dunyarzad: So tell me, what happened?
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 09.ogg Dunyarzad: The master... You mean my father?
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 10.ogg Dunyarzad: Okay, I understand. Don't worry about me, I'll listen as attentively as I can.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 11.ogg Dunyarzad: My father... has been supplying goods to Dakan Al-Ahmar?
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 12.ogg Dunyarzad: I can't help but agree with the Traveler.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 13.ogg Dunyarzad: Thank you for sharing all this information with me.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 14.ogg Dunyarzad: Since you've told me everything you know... I should also tell you about some doubts that I've been harboring for quite a while.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 15.ogg Dunyarzad: In the past, I thought that my father hired a bodyguard for me so that I wouldn't run away and get lost.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 16.ogg Dunyarzad: However, there are plenty of capable mercenaries in the Corps of Thirty. Why did my father go out of his way to hire Dehya?
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 17.ogg Dunyarzad: Well, but that didn't really answer my question. Just think about it... why did my father specifically reach out to the Blazing Beasts?
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 18.ogg Dunyarzad: Precisely. At first glance, nothing seems strange or out of place, but there are many parts of the story that don't actually make any sense.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 19.ogg Dunyarzad: If my father had always been in contact with Dakan Al-Ahmar... then it would make sense for him to bring Dehya into our house.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 20.ogg Dunyarzad: But that still doesn't rule out the possibility that your father has still been trying to influence your life without you knowing.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 21.ogg Dunyarzad: It's okay, Paimon. I should actually be thanking you.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 22.ogg Dunyarzad: Regardless of his reasons, if my father has truly been funding a violent group of mercenaries, then it's my duty to bring him back to reason.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 23.ogg Dunyarzad: It's alright, Dehya. If anyone were to ask, you could always just say that I'm the one who instructed you to get to the bottom of this.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 dunyarzad 24.ogg Dunyarzad: Sure thing. I also hope he'll be able to give us a logical explanation. Let's meet at the usual place, then.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh, wâ€”well...
Media:vo dhylq002 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? You mean you feel the same way, Dunyarzad?
Media:vo dhylq002 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You mean, the goal all along was to get Dehya to be your bodyguard?
Media:vo dhylq002 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Sorry we put all this on you so suddenly, Dunyarzad...
Media:vo dhylq002 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Dehya...
Media:vo dhylq002 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hey, it's still too early to give up hope! What was that thing about friendship again...
Media:vo dhylq002 5 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Right, yeah, trust! You said that yourself, Dehya.
Media:vo dhylq002 5 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Besides, there's no point on getting all riled up before we've even confirmed all the facts!
Media:vo dhylq002 5 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: The... usual place? Ah, right!
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Thank you for coming, sir.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 02a.ogg Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 02b.ogg Dehya: Please allow me to introduce these two. This is (Traveler), and next to (him/her) is (his/her) travel companion, Paimon.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Well, we wanted to bring this transaction record to your attention. There's something on this record that we're all pretty curious about...
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: If you wouldn't mind, we'd like an explanation.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: Wait... me?
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: His... heartfelt efforts? I'm sorry sir, but I'm not sure I follow.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: I've made it this far in life without a single drop of my father's support.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: I have my own ideals and ways of looking at the world, as well as people and causes that I've chosen to cherish and fight for... None of these things have anything to do with him.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: I came here today to support you as the head of the Homayani family. No warning will change my stance on that.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: So that's what happened...
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 11.ogg Dehya: So what happened to him? He was perfectly fine when I left the brigade...
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 12.ogg Dehya: Ugh, he was always like that... Acting like he's oh-so-smart and self-righteous...
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 13.ogg Dehya: ...If you can, please tell me where he is now.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 14.ogg Dehya: None of the things he's doing right now make any sense if he's just trying to keep me from getting tangled up in his world...
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 15.ogg Dehya: If all he wants to do is steer clear of me, then maybe he shouldn't have brought me into this world in the first place.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 16.ogg Dehya: I'm just angry because I can't wrap my head around any of his actions.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 17a 1.ogg Dehya: Another way? I dunno... I knew him, and he was nothing more than a childish brute. I can't understand what's going through his head.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 17b 1.ogg Dehya: I don't know, I really don't know... I don't think I can do it.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 18.ogg Dehya: But I guess you do have a point... We haven't uncovered the whole truth yet. We still need to figure out his exact actions and reasoning for these last few years.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dehya 19.ogg Dehya: Understood, thank you sir. Then I guess this is bye for now, unless...
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: Really? I... never knew...
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: And that's why you offered her such generous compensation?
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: I'll stay and be with my father here... To be honest, I'm still a little dazed, and haven't finished processing everything quite yet.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: My father has indeed done something wrong, but if I think about it, I'm also not sure if there was a right way to handle this problem.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 dunyarzad 05.ogg Dunyarzad: I feel like... our only course of action is to turn everything we know over to the Corps of Thirty, and let them render judgment...
Media:vo dhylq002 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So he was the one who recommended Dehya to you!
Media:vo dhylq002 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wait, isn't that around the time that Dakan Al-Ahmar started becoming more aggressive?
Media:vo dhylq002 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh no, Dehya, please don't feel that way...
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 01a.ogg Shahzaman: Ah yes, my daughter has mentioned them from time to time. It's a privilege to finally meet them in person.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 02.ogg Shahzaman: But we may skip all the pleasantries for now, what is the important matter you wished to discuss with me today?
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 03.ogg Shahzaman: So that's what you've found, huh... Seems like I can't keep everything from you much longer.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 04.ogg Shahzaman: Well, it's a long and difficult story, and to be perfectly honest, I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 05.ogg Shahzaman: What I do know though, Dehya, is that the truth will bring you no solace. If anything, it will likely cause you a great amount of anguish.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 06.ogg Shahzaman: Yes. I understand perfectly why you came to see me, and I am touched by your collective commitment to do the right thing.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 07.ogg Shahzaman: But knowledge always comes at a price, and sometimes, as they say, ignorance is bliss.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 08.ogg Shahzaman: Your father Kusayla and I both believed that.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 09.ogg Shahzaman: Of course, you have the right to seek and learn the truth, but I must warn you...
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 10.ogg Shahzaman: That the facts of this matter may reduce everything you've built for yourself into sand blowing in the wind.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 11.ogg Shahzaman: If you must proceed, then Kusayla's heartfelt efforts will also fade into the wind like a fleeting mirage.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 12.ogg Shahzaman: *sigh* I understand. Then let me tell you a little story.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 13.ogg Shahzaman: Our family once needed to take a trip to the desert when Dunyarzad was just a baby. Along the way, we were attacked by bandits.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 14.ogg Shahzaman: They had superior numbers, and quickly overpowered our bodyguards. When all seemed lost, a group of passerby Eremites lent us their support.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 15.ogg Shahzaman: Those Eremites were Kusayla's brigade, Dakan Al-Ahmar.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 16.ogg Shahzaman: Kusayla's men told me that the attackers were Eremite mercenaries just like themselves. I was shocked. Why would Dakan Al-Ahmar go so far to save us, and not spare the fellow Eremites?
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 17.ogg Shahzaman: Kusayla was grinning and walked over to play with baby Dunyarzad. She was startled by his unfamiliar face and nearly started crying.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 18.ogg Shahzaman: He said that he had no particular reason to help us. He just took pity on us because he had a daughter about the same age.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 19.ogg Shahzaman: We started talking about our children, and I sensed that he was a devoted father.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 20.ogg Shahzaman: To repay his kindness, I hired his brigade to help out at our estate for a time, and offered everyone generous remuneration.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 21.ogg Shahzaman: It was many years before I saw him again. I almost didn't recognize him the next time he came knocking on my door.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 22.ogg Shahzaman: The man I knew to be strong and healthy had been reduced to a... shell of himself. He couldn't even walk anymore without his cane.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 23.ogg Shahzaman: I'm not too sure myself. The only thing that didn't change was his cheery disposition. He said there was absolutely nothing to worry about and that he had gotten into a fight, that was all.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 24.ogg Shahzaman: He then suddenly asked me if Dunyarzad, now that she had grown, would need a bodyguard of her own.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 25.ogg Shahzaman: At the time, Dunyarzad was going through a particularly severe bout of her Eleazar. There was no need for her to have a bodyguard when she could barely leave the house...
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 26.ogg Shahzaman: But he kept coming back to the topic... "C'mon, it never hurts to be safe." "How do you know a bodyguard won't come in handy one day?"
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 27.ogg Shahzaman: I was completely lost at first, until he recommended the "Blazing Beasts," and in particular, a mercenary named Dehya.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 28.ogg Shahzaman: Indeed. He didn't say it out loud, but it was clear that he saw Deshret's Relics as an evil group who would eventually corrupt every member in their ranks.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 29.ogg Shahzaman: He was already beyond redemption, but he hoped that he would be able to detach his daughter from the vicious world of mercenary life.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 30.ogg Shahzaman: If Dehya could stay in my house and keep working as a bodyguard, then gradually her affinity for the desert would decrease, and she'd be able to leave her previous life behind.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 31.ogg Shahzaman: Yes, but not just because of that. From the moment that he asked me for that favor, I also began to see Dehya as my own daughter.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 32.ogg Shahzaman: And that's also why I tried to persuade you to stay when you asked for permission to leave. I was willing to spend however much it took...
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 33.ogg Shahzaman: Kusayla saved my daughter and I all those years ago in the desert. I could never refuse him entrusting his daughter to me.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 34.ogg Shahzaman: Kusayla said that he'd reimburse me for a portion of Dehya's fees. I refused to take any Mora from him, but he'd always send me funds anyway.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 35.ogg Shahzaman: Eventually, I just accepted them as a token of his gratitude. That went on for a while, until I received another letter from him a few years ago.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 36.ogg Shahzaman: The letter contained a request to help him buy food, weapons, medicine, and even explosive materials.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 37.ogg Shahzaman: That's right. When I started to hear some nasty rumors, I became wary, and wanted to meet him face-to-face to discuss things.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 38.ogg Shahzaman: But by then, he was no longer receptive to my requests to talk. If I had to guess... it's probably because he doesn't want to put Dehya at risk.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 39.ogg Shahzaman: That thought occurred to me as well. I figured that he probably came to me for help because he had nobody else to turn to.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 40.ogg Shahzaman: After some deliberation, I decided to send him some food and medicine. I turned down all his requests for explosives and weaponry.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 41.ogg Shahzaman: I am aware that even such a reduced gesture of support could lead to others coming to harm, but I could not simply reject his plea for help.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 42.ogg Shahzaman: In the end, it probably was the wrong decision. I plugged my ears to the rumors and just chose the solution that made me feel least guilty about myself.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 43.ogg Shahzaman: I'll do my best to help. Of course, anything between the two of you would need to be resolved between you and him alone.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 44.ogg Shahzaman: I don't know Kusayla's exact whereabouts. Outside of supplying his brigade with some goods, I tried my best to avoid getting involved any further with him.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 45.ogg Shahzaman: However, there's a man on the list named Jawad. He used to be a mercenary in the desert, and is now a member of the Corps of Thirty.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 46.ogg Shahzaman: He's responsible for supplying weapons and liaising with Dakan Al-Ahmar's merchant caravan. I think he should know Kusayla's whereabouts.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 47.ogg Shahzaman: I've heard that he likes to have a few drinks alone and enjoy the cool wind at night outside of the tavern. Maybe you'll be able to find him there.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 48.ogg Shahzaman: Yes. I am prepared to accept whatever verdict they choose.
Media:vo dhylq002 6 sahzaman 49.ogg Shahzaman: It's time to face my mistakes...
Media:vo dhylq002 7 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: I know what you've been up to. Smuggling weapons to violent brigades in the desert while working for the Corps? Pretty bold if you ask me.
Media:vo dhylq002 7 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Don't worry about that for now. You know what kind of punishment you'll face once we report you to the Corps, I assume?
Media:vo dhylq002 7 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Let me tell you how it is. We're investigating Dakan Al-Ahmar, and we're gonna put an end to their operations.
Media:vo dhylq002 7 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: If you provide some help for us, then we might just put in a good word later to reduce the terms of your punishment.
Media:vo dhylq002 7 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: Shut it.
Media:vo dhylq002 7 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: My patience is running out. You should know when a mercenary is after something other than money.
Media:vo dhylq002 7 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: Sure, and then you can forget about any nice words from us.
Media:vo dhylq002 7 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: Really? And how do I know you're not leading us straight into a trap? Don't forget, you're the one with no bargaining chips.
Media:vo dhylq002 7 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: Now that's more like it. Let's move.
Media:vo dhylq002 7 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: And as for you... try to stick around the city until we get back. You don't want us to call the folks from the Corps and have them drag you back to the city.
Media:vo dhylq002 7 jawad 01.ogg Jawad: (Ah, that's the good stuff! Nothin' tastes better.)
Media:vo dhylq002 7 jawad 02.ogg Jawad: Huh? Who are you guys?
Media:vo dhylq002 7 jawad 03.ogg Jawad: Shh, keep your voice down! How do you know all that!?
Media:vo dhylq002 7 jawad 04.ogg Jawad: Come with me, we should take this elsewhere. I'll be happy to talk things over once we're somewhere private.
Media:vo dhylq002 7 jawad 05.ogg Jawad: This place should do... Alright, back to my question, how did you all know about me?
Media:vo dhylq002 7 jawad 06.ogg Jawad: Wait wait wait, there's no need to jump the gun! Let's talk this out. What are your terms?
Media:vo dhylq002 7 jawad 07.ogg Jawad: Uhh... Well, I was a little tight on money at the time, and Kusayla took good care of me in the past...
Media:vo dhylq002 7 jawad 08.ogg Jawad: I weighed it in my mind, and I couldn't find a reason to turn the opportunity down. I wouldn't only be helping my benefactor, but I could also make some quick Mora...
Media:vo dhylq002 7 jawad 09.ogg Jawad: Hey, why don't we discuss this a little first? Listen, I made quite a bit of Mora from my last run. Just give me a number and I'm sure we can...
Media:vo dhylq002 7 jawad 10.ogg Jawad: Alright, alright, sheesh. But ya gotta promise you'll put in some nice words for me later.
Media:vo dhylq002 7 jawad 11.ogg Jawad: They're always on the move. Here's the spot they were at last time I made my delivery to the desert.
Media:vo dhylq002 7 jawad 12.ogg Jawad: Feel free to go have a look. I'm just telling you, though, it's not on me if they're not there anymore.
Media:vo dhylq002 7 jawad 13.ogg Jawad: Hey, c'mon! Now you're just being unreasonable!
Media:vo dhylq002 7 jawad 14.ogg Jawad: Alright, I get it, I get it... Why don't you go take a look, and if they're not there anymore, I'll try to figure out something else for you all.
Media:vo dhylq002 7 jawad 15.ogg Jawad: (Ugh, just my luck. How did I get caught by her of all people?)
Media:vo dhylq002 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So what's in it for you anyway? Mora?
Media:vo dhylq002 8 bashar 01.ogg Bashar: Stay outta this! It's got nothing to do with you!
Media:vo dhylq002 8 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Hmm, seems like we're in luck. That should be their camp right up ahead.
Media:vo dhylq002 8 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Let's go. We'll finally get to the bottom of this ourselves.
Media:vo dhylq002 8 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: I'm here to see Kusayla. Tell him to get out here!
Media:vo dhylq002 8 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: Haven't you all done enough?
Media:vo dhylq002 8 idrisi 01.ogg Idrisi: Oh, so are you also here to stop us?
Media:vo dhylq002 8 tikriti 01.ogg Tikriti: Huh? Dehya? Why are you here?
Media:vo dhylq002 9 bashar 01.ogg Bashar: Shâ€”She's so strong...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 bashar 02.ogg Bashar: Seems like you've been out of the loop for a while. Guess that's for the best, though... at least that's what the old man wanted.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 bashar 03.ogg Bashar: We would prefer to call it "taking revenge." Every last person in Deshret's Relics must pay in blood for what they did!
Media:vo dhylq002 9 bashar 04.ogg Bashar: Ever since you were born, boss had been trying to shield you from this organization's sinister rules.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 bashar 05.ogg Bashar: Not only that, but he also banned all of us from committing any nefarious acts. He said he'd take care of the dues we had to pay regularly to headquarters...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 bashar 06.ogg Bashar: But in the end, he was just an ordinary person. What could he do?
Media:vo dhylq002 9 bashar 07.ogg Bashar: He was forced to go to headquarters again and again to account for missed dues and incomplete records. He'd come up with all kinds of excuses, and get beaten up as a result.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 bashar 08.ogg Bashar: Yep, it was all his doing. Had he not arranged them to come to you, you probably would have been reduced to a pulp before you ever left the desert.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 bashar 09.ogg Bashar: The boss can't have just died for nothing! Those heartless jerks at headquarters took him from us!
Media:vo dhylq002 9 bashar 10.ogg Bashar: We've suffered plenty of losses as well. To keep going, we need an enormous amount of supplies... from food and medicine to weaponry and explosives.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 bashar 11.ogg Bashar: All we can do is exchange our loot for Mora, and then use that to get supplies.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 bashar 12.ogg Bashar: We forged boss's handwriting and sent out many letters to his former friends. Thankfully, many people were willing to come to our aid.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 bashar 13.ogg Bashar: We were also able to attract many mercenaries who shared our goal. We've endured unspeakable pain to win many impossible battles...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 bashar 14.ogg Bashar: Deshret's Relics have become weaker and weaker, and now... we finally have an opportunity to directly strike their headquarters.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Enough fighting. We all know each other, and I don't want to take things too far.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Just bring Kusayla to me! There's no use hiding him anymore!
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Did you understand a single word I just said? Or do I need to bash your skull in some more?
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: What...?
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: When did he die? What happened to him?
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: Overwhelming strength, and unquestionable authority?
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: I... I never even knew this was a requirement...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: Wait, but that doesn't make any sense. I didn't know about any of this, and I'd never seen him get injured or beaten...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: So, even the Blazing Beasts were...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: ...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 11.ogg Dehya: I'll go with you.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 12.ogg Dehya: I grew up with these guys, and I know they're not bad people. It's just that some situations get so bad that it's difficult to tell good from evil...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 13.ogg Dehya: All I know is that Deshret's Relics must be destroyed.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 14.ogg Dehya: Furthermore... I want to go see the place for myself. I want to know if my father is still there...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 15.ogg Dehya: I know you don't want to get involved in this, so there's no need for you to tag along. I can do this on my own.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 16.ogg Dehya: Thank you. We'll be a lot stronger together with you.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 17.ogg Dehya: He can think whatever he wants...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 dehya 18.ogg Dehya: ...But the fact is, I owe him this much.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 01.ogg Idrisi: Alright, everyone, let's all just calm down for a second.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 02.ogg Idrisi: Um, Dehya, the boss can't come out and see you anymore.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 03.ogg Idrisi: He died a long time ago.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 04.ogg Idrisi: Let me start from the beginning. Dehya, do you know how the head of the Relics maintained order internally?
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 05.ogg Idrisi: Those were a part of it, yes. But just those on their own weren't enough. They had another tool at their disposal. They called it a person's "record."
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 06.ogg Idrisi: Regardless of whether they joined by their own will or were coerced, every person in Deshret's Relics were forced to leave a record of themselves at headquarters.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 07.ogg Idrisi: Whether it be their deepest sin, some unforgivable act, or their most immoral exploit, the record served both as a symbol of loyalty and the perfect material for blackmail.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 08.ogg Idrisi: That's precisely it. Every one of us have a record... me, Bashar, Tikriti, and all the boys who grew up with Dehya and ended up joining our ranks.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 09.ogg Idrisi: But you, Dehya... you were never asked to provide a record, were you?
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 10.ogg Idrisi: You were probably the only person in all of Deshret's Relics who didn't know about it.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 11.ogg Idrisi: Because you were too young at the time. How would you ever tell between wounds from a beating and wounds from battle?
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 12.ogg Idrisi: When you left home after that final argument with him, he seemed to age by a decade overnight. Even his hair went gray.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 13.ogg Idrisi: A few years ago, boss said he needed to make another trip to headquarters. He was already pretty weak then, and we all assumed he was going to get beaten again.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 14.ogg Idrisi: I suggested that he hand the role of leadership over to me, but he said there was no longer any need, since Dakan Al-Ahmar would soon be no more.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 15.ogg Idrisi: His words made no sense to me, but that night, we heard that a massive fire tore through headquarters, and razed everyone's "records" to ash.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 16.ogg Idrisi: From that point on, the sole purpose of Dakan Al-Ahmar became revenge.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 17.ogg Idrisi: The big fire that boss started was quite a blow to headquarters' strength. It's given us the opportunity to launch our attack.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 18.ogg Idrisi: Even though we're outnumbered, we've vowed to see our revenge through to the very end.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 19.ogg Idrisi: There were people from headquarters who changed their names and went into hiding. Some fled to other brigades, and others escaped to the rainforest.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 20.ogg Idrisi: But we won't let any of them escape our wrath. They'll all pay for what they've done.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 21.ogg Idrisi: Hah, we do know right from wrong. But we were sinners from the very beginning... We do not deserve the freedom that the boss won for us with his life.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 22.ogg Idrisi: Boss always loved his old-fashioned hero stories... those tales about sacrificing yourself to save the world.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 23.ogg Idrisi: We used to always laugh at him for it, but in the end, he really went and lived those stories out himself...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 24.ogg Idrisi: As for me, I never considered myself a hero. We're all the lowest of the low. We have no right to even imagine such an existence.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 25.ogg Idrisi: But maybe those hero stories he liked foreshadowed everything that was to come. The spirit of the hero touched all those he had saved, and more and more people joined his cause...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 26.ogg Idrisi: Maybe we were all just acting along with the play in the beginning, but as we acted the parts and recited the lines, we were drawn in, and now we want to see the story through to the end...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 27.ogg Idrisi: I'm sorry, Dehya. I know you always found us insufferable ever since you were young. Just think of this as a madman ranting.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 idrisi 28.ogg Idrisi: Haha, I bet boss would lose his mind if he ever knew you'd join us at the very last moment like this.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So is that when you guys started acting up?
Media:vo dhylq002 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: ...And that was why he became a shell of himself, and couldn't walk without a cane.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Uh... Paimon doesn't know what to say anymore.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? Dehya, you want to go with them?
Media:vo dhylq002 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Yeah, Paimon feels like we'd only regret it if we don't see this through to the end...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 tikriti 01.ogg Tikriti: ...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 tikriti 02.ogg Tikriti: A few years ago, Kusayla broke up Dakan Al-Ahmar, and went to the Deshret's Relics headquarters by himself.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 tikriti 03.ogg Tikriti: We all knew he was doing that for you. He wanted to get you out of this world, no matter what it took.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 tikriti 04.ogg Tikriti: Everyone gained their freedom that night. Many members fled... not just from our ranks, but from the other brigades as well.
Media:vo dhylq002 9 tikriti 05.ogg Tikriti: But how could we leave with a clear conscience? All of us, who knew exactly what had happened...
Media:vo dhylq002 9 tikriti 06.ogg Tikriti: Considering all the losses and injuries we've sustained... We can't afford to turn down someone as powerful as you.
Media:vo dialog dhylq002 jawad 01.ogg Jawad: Oh, don't worry, I'm not goin' anywhere...
You go to the back of the tavern.
