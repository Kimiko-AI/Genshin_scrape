 (An outcast that even the sages are still wary of?)
 (Great, we've finally convinced her.)
 (Huh? King Deshret's resurrection is a misinformation campaign?)
 Alright.
 Before I knew it, I really started getting into the role.
 But in reality...
 Can't we just call her Nahida?
 Did I push too hard?
 Divine my prospects in health.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06a 1.ogg Nabiya: Health prospects? No problem at all.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06a 2.ogg Nabiya: ...
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06a 3.ogg Nabiya: Hummm... The gods have spoken. The truth shall be revealed.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06a 4.ogg Nabiya: Your life shall continue on for... for... Huh!? Many... many tens of thousands of years!? Impossible...
 Divine my prospects in love.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06b 1.ogg Nabiya: Love prospects? No problem at all.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06b 2.ogg Nabiya: ...
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06b 3.ogg Nabiya: Hummm... The gods have spoken. The truth shall be revealed.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06b 4.ogg Nabiya: One who is fated to cross your path will appear on... on... Huh!? So... so many people will fall for you!? How could that be...
 Don't you feel like something is off?
 Hamru and Tamru.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 06a 1.ogg Setaria: Hmm, are you sure? Those aren't ringing a bell for some reason...
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 02a 1.ogg Nabiya: Ah, well... A—Actually, they have many names. Which names I use depends on my mood.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 06a 2.ogg Setaria: Huh, I see. I imagine that must be hard for the kitties, too.
 Harut and Marut.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 06b 1.ogg Setaria: Ahh, that's right! They are just little darlings, aren't they? Harut and Marut...
 He's feeling a lot better, and he's walking more now.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 05a 1.ogg Setaria: Ah, that's good to hear. I've been thinking a lot about him... If I could get some more time off, I'd love to pay him a visit.
 He's feeling a lot better. He can lift stuff now.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 05b 1.ogg Setaria: Huh? Wasn't he nursing a leg injury? If I recall correctly, his strong arms had always been his pride and joy.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 akim 02b 1.ogg Akim: Uhh, he... sprained his arm a while back while trying to show off his strength. I thought you'd heard.
 Hummm... Ah, the gods have spoken!
 I can't think of anything else.
 I feel embarrassed just imagining it.
 I somehow doubt that...
 I wasn't too harsh, was I?
 I'll try my best.
 I'm not sure... that guy was pretty terrifying.
 If King Deshret were to criticize Setaria's actions...
 If King Deshret were to make demands of Setaria...
 Il Dottore, The Doctor — The Second of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers 
 Isn't that just asking for a beating?
 It's just a little too quiet around here.
 It's not too late to turn back.
 Let's go find Tighnari.
 Let's go find someone else who might be involved.
 Let's start our own investigation.
 Mercenaries and orphanages really don't go together.
 No, I've been spending all my time studying in the attic.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 03b 1.ogg Setaria: Wait, did you just say attic? I thought this place didn't have an attic... Also, don't you usually study in the basement?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 qishan 01b 1.ogg Qishan: Uh, well... The restaurant recently added an attic. I've been studying there because it has better lighting.
 No, I've been spending all my time studying in the basement.
 Ohohoho... The gods have spoken!
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 09b 1.ogg Setaria: Pfft... Sorry, your new laugh is just so hilarious, I couldn't help it...
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 07b 1.ogg Nabiya: Oh! Uh, please pay no mind to those kinds of details.
 Possess a key figure in the Akademiya?
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03a 1.ogg Nahida: I've already tried that, but all the key members of the Akademiya — even the Corps of Thirty guards — intentionally avoid wearing their Akasha Terminals.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03a 2.ogg Nahida: It seems that from the very beginning, they've been guarding against info leaks from the Akasha. Of course, it could also be because they're wary of me.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 02a 1.ogg Paimon: Have you already caught the sages' attention?
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03a 3.ogg Nahida: I'm guessing not yet, but distrusting me would make perfect sense if they ever paid attention to the urban legends about me.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03a 4.ogg Nahida: In any case, I probably can't take over their minds directly.
(Return to option selection)
 Possess a student and infiltrate the sages' quarters?
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03b 1.ogg Nahida: No way. That's too risky.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 02b 1.ogg Paimon: You mean it'd be too easy to get caught?
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03b 2.ogg Nahida: No, it's not that. We shouldn't involve innocent students in this. A single mistake could completely ruin their lives.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03b 3.ogg Nahida: Doing that would be ignoring the safety of my people for my own selfish goals. How is that any different from what the sages are doing?
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 02b 2.ogg Paimon: That's a good point. Spoken like the God of Sumeru!

 Quest DescriptionIt has been a long time since the Sabzeruz samsara, and many things cannot be ascertained until Nahida gets back in form. Today, you go to the Adventurers' Guild as usual...
 She can jump between minds. Hopefully she'll be fine?
 So, the Akasha can't take away the dreams of gods?
 Sounds exactly like the person we need.
 Speaking of which...
 The audience would definitely have a... reaction.
 This is no longer just a metaphor...
 Those are Setaria's true thoughts, right?
 Uh, gardening work.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 03a 1.ogg Setaria: Gardening? But don't you hate everything to do with plants? I still remember getting mad at you for secretly throwing away the bonsai that I gave you as a present.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 akim 01a 1.ogg Akim: Erm... Well, uh, you see, a friend told me that the secret to self-improvement is to work on things you're not so good at.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 03a 2.ogg Setaria: ...Fair enough. I didn't think that was something you would consider.
 Uh, masonry work.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 03b 1.ogg Setaria: Oh, right, your old man's craft... How could I forget?
 We could grab someone close to the sages and question them?
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03c 1.ogg Nahida: We're in the dark as of now. Since we still don't know anything about their goals, any rash move could tip them off and lead to terrible consequences.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03c 2.ogg Nahida: After all, every person in Sumeru City is one of their hostages.
(Return to option selection)
 We need to find a way to reunite with Nahida.
 We underestimated the number of parties involved.
 We underestimated the scale of this problem.
 What did you dream about?
 Yeah...
 You should follow your heart.
 You're Nahida, right?
 You're not actually Katheryne, are you?
Cat: Meow!
Cat: Meow?
Cutscene's Travel Log summary:
You and "Katheryne" arrive at the gate of the Akademiya, only to find that a huge crowd has been waiting. Their elated faces seem to indicate that they are expecting someone. What shocks you more still is to see Dottore, the Second of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, with them.It turns out that it was he who created this bizarre scene. By adjusting the Akasha Terminals, he managed to distribute information directly into people's consciousnesses. Now, everyone believes that you are the hero who just saved the world and are frantically throwing themselves at you. These are merely innocent people, so you find yourself in a dilemma. At this moment, Nahida's consciousness, which is residing in Katheryne, takes control of the people's minds. This stopped them and created an opportunity for you to escape the scene. But at the same time, Dottore discovered the secret hidden within "Katheryne"...
(Cheering citizens line the sides of the ramp towards the Akademiya entrance)
Paimon: What are all these people doing here
Paimon: At this hour of the night?
(A man starts to walk down the ramp)
Dottore: Ah, the triumphant hero returns at last
Dottore: And to a rather spectacular welcome, even if I do say so myself
Nahida: You're...
Nahida: The outcast, expelled from the Akademiya...
Dottore: Indeed, I am, although these days they tend to call me:
Dottore: The Doctor
Dottore: Ah, the triumphant hero returns at last
Dottore: And now, it seems they can no longer hold back their sheer adoration
Dottore: And to a rather spectacular welcome, even if I do say so myself
Dottore: As you can see, all these lovely people now believe
Dottore: Clearly, she lacks the degree of rigor expected of a true scholar
Dottore: Hehe... My experiment is a success
Dottore: I see... You appear to have overridden their mental faculties
Dottore: I simply made some minor adjustments to their Akasha Terminals
Dottore: If you're looking for your researcher friend, she has already been taken into confinement
Dottore: If you're looking for your researcher friend, she has already been taken into confinement
Dottore: With some basic caution, she could have discovered the listening device on her person
Dottore: Clearly, she lacks the degree of rigor expected of a true scholar
Nahida: The people of Sumeru City...
Nahida: What have you done to them?
Dottore: I simply made some minor adjustments to their Akasha Terminals
Dottore: Now they can deposit information directly into the subconscious
(The citizens start to walk slowly towards the Traveler and company)
Dottore: As you can see, all these lovely people now believe
Dottore: This Traveler is a hero who has just saved the world
Dottore: Hehe... My experiment is a success
(The citizens seem to become more manic, and the Traveler steps back)
Dottore: And now, it seems they can no longer hold back their sheer adoration
Paimon: Oh no
Paimon: What should we do!? These are all just regular people...
("Katheryne" stands between the Traveler and the crowd)
Nahida: Leave now
Nahida: You need to get out of here
Paimon: But...
Paimon: That guy's a Fatui Harbinger! We can't just leave you here...
Nahida: Nor can I abandon... the people of Sumeru!
(Nahida takes control of the citizens' Akasha Terminals, causing them to fall unconscious)
Nahida: Don't worry
Nahida: We'll meet again outside of the city
(The Traveler and Paimon leave. Il Dottore closes in on Nahida, who is still controlling the people)
Dottore: I see... You appear to have overridden their mental faculties
Dottore: With your own consciousness
Dottore: To possess such a powerful mind...
Dottore: You must be...
Dottore: The God of Wisdom
(Cinematic ends)
Dottore: Indeed, I am, although these days they tend to call me:
Dottore: Now they can deposit information directly into the subconscious
Dottore: The Doctor
Dottore: The God of Wisdom
Dottore: This Traveler is a hero who has just saved the world
Dottore: To possess such a powerful mind...
Dottore: With some basic caution, she could have discovered the listening device on her person
Dottore: With your own consciousness
Dottore: You must be...
Media:vo dialog xmaq101 akim 01.ogg Akim: That was my first time talking with Miss Katheryne. Hehe, I'm sure I sounded a bit nervous...
Media:vo dialog xmaq101 akim 02.ogg Akim: Whoa... What happened just now? Wasn't I talking with Setaria? Where'd she go?
Media:vo dialog xmaq101 nabiya 01.ogg Nabiya: I've never seen Harut and Marut be so wary of anyone...
Media:vo dialog xmaq101 nabiya 02.ogg Nabiya: Huh? What's gotten into Harut and Marut? They seem terrified of me all of a sudden...
Media:vo dialog xmaq101 qishan 01.ogg Qishan: I must have met her somewhere. Why can't I remember?
Media:vo dialog xmaq101 qishan 02.ogg Qishan: *yawn* I seem to have dozed off just now... Maybe I studied way too late last night? Ah, I'm sorry, can I help you with anything?
Media:vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 01.ogg Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! We meet again, you two.
Media:vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 02.ogg Katheryne: Commissions, huh? Hmmm, let me think...
Media:vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 03.ogg Katheryne: Oh, how about this? Please attend the Akademiya's academic symposium this afternoon, and recite a love poem onstage.
Media:vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 04.ogg Katheryne: And if possible, please also use your Kamera to capture the reaction of the audience upon finishing the poem.
Media:vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 05.ogg Katheryne: I see... It appears that you're not interested in this commission.
Media:vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 06.ogg Katheryne: In that case, please go to Port Ormos and convince the Eremites there to spend some time volunteering at the local orphanage.
Media:vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 07.ogg Katheryne: Mm-hmm, I'm sure the mercenaries will have some interesting reactions as well.
Media:vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 08.ogg Katheryne: Oh, the commissioner? Hmm, well actually, I just wanted to see the two of you in action...
Media:vo xmaq101 1 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: Hehe, was it so obvious? I was hoping you would actually take one of those commissions. That kind of chance to observe humans doesn't come by often...
Media:vo xmaq101 1 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: Hmm... From when she said "Ad astra abyssosque"?
Media:vo xmaq101 1 nahida 03.ogg Nahida: Yes. I've been sleeping ever since we parted ways, and I even had a really, really long dream...
Media:vo xmaq101 1 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: It was another dream about the Sabzeruz Festival, except it was a happy one!
Media:vo xmaq101 1 nahida 05.ogg Nahida: In my dream, I was sitting in the middle of a flower terrace, and everyone in Sumeru City was holding hands as they danced in circles around me... They danced round and round, and everyone looked really happy.
Media:vo xmaq101 1 nahida 06.ogg Nahida: I also got to sit on a gigantic flower carriage. Farris, the Knight of Flowers, raised me really, really high above the ground, and I was throwing an endless amount of Yalda Candies at the children...
Media:vo xmaq101 1 nahida 07.ogg Nahida: Eh? Wasn't I describing a really happy dream? Why are you both looking at me like that... Wait, could this be an example of the emotion known as "pity"?
Media:vo xmaq101 1 nahida 08.ogg Nahida: Yes, I paid her a visit right after I woke up. She was resting at the time.
Media:vo xmaq101 1 nahida 09.ogg Nahida: Her condition has stabilized. However, since Eleazar is a manifestation of the Withering on the human body, we can only cure it by finding a way to take care of Irminsul's own withering.
Media:vo xmaq101 1 nahida 10.ogg Nahida: But for the moment, our top focus should still be figuring out what the sages are up to and what they're planning.
Media:vo xmaq101 1 nahida 11.ogg Nahida: So, our first priority should be investigating and putting a stop to the sages' activities. As for how we should pull that off, let's discuss it somewhere else. There are too many adventurers around here.
Media:vo xmaq101 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We've spent quite some time in Sumeru City, but ever since we last said goodbye to Lesser Lord Kusanali, we haven't heard anything from her...
Media:vo xmaq101 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: *sigh* We can't just keep waiting around like this. Let's go find Katheryne and pick up some work so we can at least keep ourselves busy!
Media:vo xmaq101 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hi Katheryne, do you have any commissions for us today?
Media:vo xmaq101 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Uh, wait, say what now?
Media:vo xmaq101 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh? What kind of commission is that?
Media:vo xmaq101 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hey! That's not any better!
Media:vo xmaq101 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Uh, Paimon's gotta ask... Just who exactly has been submitting these commissions to the Adventurers' Guild?
Media:vo xmaq101 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Ahh, so it's Nahida! Paimon just knew Katheryne wouldn't crack those kinds of jokes. When did you get into her head?
Media:vo xmaq101 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: So it's been you this whole time!?
Media:vo xmaq101 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: *sigh* Are you done resting up, Nahida?
Media:vo xmaq101 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: You know, Nahida, maybe your dream is how the Sabzeruz Festival really should be. It's meant to be a joyous time, where everyone gets together to celebrate your birthday...
Media:vo xmaq101 1 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: No, no, we aren't pitying you! That would only make everything worse. We just don't want you to feel too sad.
Media:vo xmaq101 1 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: By the way, have you had a chance to visit Dunyarzad? How's she doing? The Homayanis haven't allowed any visitors after the festival, so we haven't been able to check on her.
Media:vo xmaq101 1 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Right. Who knows what'll happen if they manage to pull off another scheme like the samsara of the Sabzeruz Festival.
Media:vo xmaq101 1 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Oh, good point! Uh, sorry adventurers, we're gonna be borrowing Katheryne for a little while~!
Media:vo xmaq101 10 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: That's right. I suppose I'm the "other Katheryne" in your mind.
Media:vo xmaq101 10 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: Yep, Paimon's right. We cannot fully rule out the chance that the meet-up tonight is just a trap.
Media:vo xmaq101 10 nahida 03.ogg Nahida: If something were to happen, my existence may be the only trump card we'll be able to play.
Media:vo xmaq101 10 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: After all, the Akademiya should still be unable to confirm the existence of my consciousness in the outside world.
Media:vo xmaq101 10 nahida 05a.ogg Media:vo xmaq101 10 nahida 05b.ogg Nahida: No, I think (Traveler)'s right. It really is a lot quieter than usual.
Media:vo xmaq101 10 nahida 06.ogg Nahida: If you look around, there seems to be fewer people on the streets. I'm not sure if this is the case for the entire city, though...
Media:vo xmaq101 10 nahida 07.ogg Nahida: I also can't quite figure out why things feel a little off... But, now that we're here, let's go ahead and meet her as we planned.
Media:vo xmaq101 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Katheryne, we're here! Oh, hmm... You're the "other" Katheryne, right?
Media:vo xmaq101 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Shh...! We're on a secret mission tonight, so we need to protect Katheryne's identity!
Media:vo xmaq101 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yep, yep! Exactly, just what Paimon was thinking!
Media:vo xmaq101 10 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Ugh... Anyway, enough about that! Let's just make sure to be on our guard!
Media:vo xmaq101 10 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Off? What do you feel is off?
Media:vo xmaq101 10 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: It's the middle of the night — of course it's quiet! You're not getting paranoid, are you?
Media:vo xmaq101 10 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Huh, maybe it's just a coincidence? Maybe Setaria figured out a way to not only distract the guards, but also to get everyone to go to sleep early, just so we can exchange the documents in peace.
Media:vo xmaq101 10 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Well, regardless... as long as you're here with us, Paimon feels a little safer!
Media:vo xmaq101 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh, there really aren't many people out right now... Let's hope it'll be this quiet in front of the Akademiya, and that Setaria managed to distract all the guards...
Media:vo xmaq101 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: This should be far enough... Phew, Paimon needs to catch her breath first.
Media:vo xmaq101 11 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Is Nahida going to be okay? We only made it out because of her...
Media:vo xmaq101 11 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Paimon wasn't counting on running into a new Harbinger here, let alone such a high-ranking one! That guy was number two... so scary...
Media:vo xmaq101 11 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: He called himself "The Doctor"... Remember Tighnari told us about him. Setaria did say that someone who once got expelled from the Akademiya came back recently...
Media:vo xmaq101 11 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: ...and that even the sages are wary of him. Yep, sounds like she must've been talking about The Doctor.
Media:vo xmaq101 11 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Yeah. Now that The Doctor's in the picture, we're no longer just dealing with the Akademiya — they're in cahoots with the Fatui.
Media:vo xmaq101 11 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: But what are the Fatui after this time? Another Gnosis?
Media:vo xmaq101 11 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Yeah, things would be a lot easier with Nahida's help.
Media:vo xmaq101 11 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Nahida said "We'll meet again outside of the city," but we can't just keep waiting around, right?
Media:vo xmaq101 11 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Eh? You mean...
Media:vo xmaq101 11 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Oh! Right, wasn't he invited by the sages to work on some project when we were staying with him in the Avidya Forest? That has to be the same project.
Media:vo xmaq101 11 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Even though he turned it down at that time, he might still know something.
Media:vo xmaq101 11 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: There's no time to lose. Let's go to Gandharva Ville!
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: Let's continue our chat here.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: Actually, I've already done a little bit of work on that, but for now, I want to hear your thoughts.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03a 1.ogg Nahida: I've already tried that, but all the key members of the Akademiya — even the Corps of Thirty guards — intentionally avoid wearing their Akasha Terminals.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03a 2.ogg Nahida: It seems that from the very beginning, they've been guarding against info leaks from the Akasha. Of course, it could also be because they're wary of me.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03a 3.ogg Nahida: I'm guessing not yet, but distrusting me would make perfect sense if they ever paid attention to the urban legends about me.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03a 4.ogg Nahida: In any case, I probably can't take over their minds directly.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03b 1.ogg Nahida: No way. That's too risky.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03b 2.ogg Nahida: No, it's not that. We shouldn't involve innocent students in this. A single mistake could completely ruin their lives.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03b 3.ogg Nahida: Doing that would be ignoring the safety of my people for my own selfish goals. How is that any different from what the sages are doing?
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03c 1.ogg Nahida: We're in the dark as of now. Since we still don't know anything about their goals, any rash move could tip them off and lead to terrible consequences.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03c 2.ogg Nahida: After all, every person in Sumeru City is one of their hostages.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: According to a popular theory from the Vahumana Darshan of the Akademiya, rejecting impractical motions at the beginning of a planning session will give more weight to the actual proposal.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 05.ogg Nahida: Well, I've been thinking that if I can't directly possess the leaders, and if I can't get ordinary people involved...
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 06.ogg Nahida: Then I should find someone who's already involved, but hasn't decided to side with the sages.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 07.ogg Nahida: Actually, I already have someone in mind. Do you still remember that female scholar named Setaria?
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 08.ogg Nahida: Mm-hmm. I've always liked observing all kinds of people, and Setaria has always stood out from the crowd.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 09.ogg Nahida: She was born in the desert, and was hailed as their greatest genius. Her academic gifts allowed her special admission into the Akademiya, and also gave her the opportunity to serve as the sages' assistant.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 10.ogg Nahida: The name Setaria means "star." When she lived in the desert, she shone like the brightest star in the night sky.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 11.ogg Nahida: Later on, she was chosen by the Sun. The star was given a place in the daytime sky to complement the Sun's dazzling light.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 12.ogg Nahida: Soon after, the star witnessed the Sun scorching the earth, which brought forth many disasters.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 13.ogg Nahida: The star began to waver. Instead of staying beside such a sun, wouldn't it be better to return and light up part of the night sky?
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 14.ogg Nahida: But in the end, she couldn't give up the radiance of daytime. To cope with her shame, the star buried her guilt and closed her eyes...
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 15.ogg Nahida: Indeed. When they are presented with complex moral issues, many people will simply plug their ears and go with the flow until the problem can't be fixed anymore.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 16.ogg Nahida: She's suppressing a lot of guilt, but before she realized it, she had already become the sages' accomplice. She can't deny her part in their schemes anymore.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 17.ogg Nahida: Right. We must somehow make her face her problems again...
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 18.ogg Nahida: That way, not only can we get useful intel from her, but she can also use it as an opportunity to redeem herself.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 19.ogg Nahida: From my past observations, Setaria will take a day off from the Akademiya every ten days to do some shopping in the city.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 20.ogg Nahida: Tomorrow afternoon just happens to be a shopping day for her. That'll be our chance.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 nahida 21.ogg Nahida: To prepare, let's go check out some of her favorite spots, and have a quick chat with a few of the vendors there.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Okay. So do you have any ideas on how we can investigate the sages, Nahida?
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 02a 1.ogg Paimon: Have you already caught the sages' attention?
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 02b 1.ogg Paimon: You mean it'd be too easy to get caught?
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 02b 2.ogg Paimon: That's a good point. Spoken like the God of Sumeru!
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Are we really out of ideas?
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Nahida, you're super smart, so you already have something in mind, right? Don't keep us in suspense — spill the beans already!
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Okay, okay, but aren't you the God of Wisdom? You don't have to use that kind of gimmick to make us take your ideas seriously.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: You're saying we should recruit a spy? Hmm, that does sound like it could work.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Oh! Before coming back, we met someone named Alhaitham. He seems like he acts alone, and he likes doing stuff behind the Akademiya's back. They probably aren't in cahoots.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Setaria... Paimon remembers now! Isn't she the one who's always trailing behind the Grand Sage of the Akademiya?
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: We ran into her basically every time the Sabzeruz Festival repeated itself. You could even say we're old enemies by now...
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Paimon still remembers the smug and mean way she always spoke to Nilou!
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon didn't know she was from the desert! She must be pretty special, then. Paimon feels like most of the desert-dwellers around the city are working as mercenaries.
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: From the sound of it, Setaria's just hung up on the research opportunities here...
Media:vo xmaq101 2 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: But she doesn't really support the Akademiya. She still feels guilty about not doing more for the desert, right...? She's just running away from her problems!
Media:vo xmaq101 3 katheryne 01a.ogg Media:vo xmaq101 3 katheryne 01b.ogg Nahida: Shh... Ahem, my friend here has some doubts regarding (his/her) future. Can we get a fortune reading for (him/her)?
Media:vo xmaq101 3 katheryne 02.ogg Nahida: Oh, nothing. (Traveler), go on, pick an aspect for her to divine.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 katheryne 03.ogg Nahida: Is that so... Well, that can't be helped.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 01.ogg Nabiya: My poor lost lambs, have you become troubled over your fates?
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 02.ogg Nabiya: The divine voice of wisdom often echoes between mine ears. If thou be blessed today by the gods, I may be able to show you the way.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 03.ogg Nabiya: Hummm... of course, of course. In that case...
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 04.ogg Nabiya: Oho, it would seem that Harut and Marut are quite wary of you. Perhaps at some time in the past, you have somehow offended the gods?
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 05.ogg Nabiya: Hmm?
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06a 1.ogg Nabiya: Health prospects? No problem at all.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06a 2.ogg Nabiya: ...
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06a 3.ogg Nabiya: Hummm... The gods have spoken. The truth shall be revealed.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06a 4.ogg Nabiya: Your life shall continue on for... for... Huh!? Many... many tens of thousands of years!? Impossible...
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06b 1.ogg Nabiya: Love prospects? No problem at all.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06b 2.ogg Nabiya: ...
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06b 3.ogg Nabiya: Hummm... The gods have spoken. The truth shall be revealed.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06b 4.ogg Nabiya: One who is fated to cross your path will appear on... on... Huh!? So... so many people will fall for you!? How could that be...
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 07.ogg Nabiya: Harut, Marut, did you two spoil my divination? I've never read a fortune so absurd.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 08.ogg Nabiya: Ahem, I admit that the orientation of today's celestial matrix is suboptimal. As such, there will be no charge.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 09.ogg Nabiya: If you were to bring some food offerings for Harut and Marut on your next visit, perhaps they could help you reverse the wheels of fate?
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: This should be Setaria's favorite fortune-telling spot.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: No, I already have enough information on Setaria. The most important thing now is for you to pay attention to the vendor's talking style and key characteristics.
Media:vo xmaq101 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh... so, should we ask the fortune-teller about Setaria?
Media:vo xmaq101 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Talking style and... key characteristics?
Media:vo xmaq101 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh, really? Nahida, you've been whispering things to her?
Media:vo xmaq101 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Only mocking the God of Anemo, questioning the Lord of Geo's financial savviness, and brawling with the God of Electro... Do those count?
Media:vo xmaq101 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Uhh, actually, Paimon thinks this is probably the most accurate fortune-telling you've ever done...
Media:vo xmaq101 4 akim 01.ogg Akim: Ah, dear customers, would you like to look at some pottery?
Media:vo xmaq101 4 akim 02.ogg Akim: Oh! I recognize you. Aren't you Miss Katheryne from the Adventurers' Guild? Sounds like I'm in for some big business!
Media:vo xmaq101 4 akim 03.ogg Akim: I suppose you could say it all started with my dad. He's a mason by trade, but I picked up an interest in clay while apprenticing for him.
Media:vo xmaq101 4 akim 04.ogg Akim: After that, I began making pottery by myself in secret, and I simply changed trades when my works turned out well. Although, it's a pity that I'm no longer making much use of the knowledge provided to me by the Akasha...
Media:vo xmaq101 4 akim 05.ogg Akim: Oh no, not anymore. A few years back, he fell from a roof and broke his leg. Since he had already saved enough Mora over all these years, he's just enjoying the retired life in Port Ormos nowadays.
Media:vo xmaq101 4 akim 06.ogg Akim: No problem. Rest easy, all our goods are sure to meet your every need.
Media:vo xmaq101 4 katheryne 01.ogg Nahida: We caught wind of your great craftsmanship, so we specifically came to take a look.
Media:vo xmaq101 4 katheryne 02.ogg Nahida: Speaking of, where did you learn this trade?
Media:vo xmaq101 4 katheryne 03.ogg Nahida: Hmm, so is your father still working as a mason?
Media:vo xmaq101 4 katheryne 04.ogg Nahida: I see. We wish him peace and happiness in his retirement.
Media:vo xmaq101 4 katheryne 05.ogg Nahida: I'll have someone in charge of logistics at the guild come by another day for some goods. We'll leave you to it. Take care now!
Media:vo xmaq101 4 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: Yep. It belongs to Akim. His father helped Setaria a lot when she first moved to Sumeru City, so she still comes by whenever she has time.
Media:vo xmaq101 4 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: When I start talking with him, listen carefully to the details of our conversation.
Media:vo xmaq101 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Is this another one of Setaria's favorite stalls?
Media:vo xmaq101 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: That's nice! You're making a living doing something you love!
Media:vo xmaq101 5 katheryne 01.ogg Nahida: Hi there. I feel like I've seen you down by the docks before...
Media:vo xmaq101 5 katheryne 02.ogg Nahida: If I recall, you were having a discussion with someone about ship-building at the time.
Media:vo xmaq101 5 katheryne 03.ogg Nahida: What an admirable spirit for learning. Amazing!
Media:vo xmaq101 5 katheryne 04.ogg Nahida: So this restaurant has a basement as well? Huh, first I've heard of it.
Media:vo xmaq101 5 katheryne 05.ogg Nahida: I see... Guess that makes sense. Well, good luck with your studies, Miss Qishan.
Media:vo xmaq101 5 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: This should be our final stop. Setaria is always thinking of this restaurant when she's working at the Akademiya, so she always comes by whenever she's out in the city.
Media:vo xmaq101 5 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: Hehe, it's my duty to protect Sumeru's citizens, after all.
Media:vo xmaq101 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Nahida, you've really thought of everything!
Media:vo xmaq101 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Sure... But you'll find hard-working people wherever you go!
Media:vo xmaq101 5 qishan 01.ogg Qishan: Huh? Sorry, I don't quite remember...
Media:vo xmaq101 5 qishan 02.ogg Qishan: Ah, that's right! I've always been really interested in feats of marine engineering.
Media:vo xmaq101 5 qishan 03.ogg Qishan: After all, I grew up in Liyue Harbor and spent my entire childhood staring at the ships going in and out of the port. I came to Sumeru to study, but failed to make it into the Akademiya due to my lack of talent.
Media:vo xmaq101 5 qishan 04.ogg Qishan: But I'm still discussing all kinds of problems with different scholars, and I'm continuing to study and perform research from the restaurant's basement. I'm sure I'll get into the Akademiya after their next round of exams!
Media:vo xmaq101 5 qishan 05.ogg Qishan: That's right! It's not usually open to patrons. Most of the time, employees use it for breaks or to hold private events.
Media:vo xmaq101 5 qishan 06.ogg Qishan: Haha, thank you so much. As long as I can make it into the Akademiya as an official student, I'll be happy.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: Mm-hmm. Three familiar faces should be enough for Setaria.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: Setaria is already used to avoiding her problems, so we must find a way to break through her usual sensibilities.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 nahida 03.ogg Nahida: I remember you mentioned that the Eremites in Port Ormos are all making a fuss about the upcoming resurrection of King Deshret.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: Although it's all just a boatload of nonsense, the faith of her homeland may turn out to be Setaria's soft spot.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 nahida 05.ogg Nahida: Well, King Deshret is long gone, and Setaria is also too smart to fall for any simple tricks...
Media:vo xmaq101 6 nahida 06.ogg Nahida: If we simply engaged her under the guise of King Deshret's believers, she'd definitely be wary of us, and we may not get anywhere.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 nahida 07.ogg Nahida: But if we were to "borrow" some of her close acquaintances to talk with her... her reaction would probably be very different.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 nahida 08.ogg Nahida: Yep. Possess them through the Akasha, imply that they've already converted to the faith of King Deshret, and then convey our made-up "will of King Deshret."
Media:vo xmaq101 6 nahida 09.ogg Nahida: As long as everything goes smoothly, we'll get through to Setaria for sure. She'll never guess that we had anything to do with it.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 nahida 10.ogg Nahida: Exactly! So, best of luck with impersonating them.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 nahida 11.ogg Nahida: That's no problem at all. I'll just share all their senses with you once I've possessed them. As long as you're also wearing an Akasha Terminal, the effect will basically be as if you've possessed them yourself.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 nahida 12.ogg Nahida: Although I've been observing humans for a while, I've never been good at imitating them...
Media:vo xmaq101 6 nahida 13.ogg Nahida: *sigh* If it was at all possible, I would've preferred to leave these people alone, but seeing how things are now, I probably should just accept it and push on.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 nahida 14.ogg Nahida: Alright, then let's give it a go tomorrow afternoon.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So, was that everybody?
Media:vo xmaq101 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What's the point of all the information we've collected? Nahida, you still haven't told us how you're planning to make Setaria face her problems.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it now... You want to take advantage of the guilt Setaria feels about her homeland.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Although she knows she should return home to help the people of the desert, all she's done is conspire with the sages...
Media:vo xmaq101 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hmm, so how do we set that up?
Media:vo xmaq101 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: So you mean, you're going to possess those people we just talked to?
Media:vo xmaq101 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Ahh, so that's how you're going to use all the info we collected on these people — it's so that you won't slip up and break form! Possessing them will only work if you can manage to pass off as them.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Huh? Best of luck? B—But we don't know how to possess anyone!
Media:vo xmaq101 6 paimon 09a.ogg Media:vo xmaq101 6 paimon 09b.ogg Paimon: Huh, that is pretty convenient... But why does (he/she) have to do this? Can't you do it yourself?
Media:vo xmaq101 6 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Hmm, you're not wrong... It's always been painfully obvious whenever you try to pass as Katheryne.
Media:vo xmaq101 6 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Yeah, don't beat yourself up over it! We're only doing this to help everyone, and we'll only be borrowing them for a little while anyway.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 01.ogg Nabiya: Oh, o—of course I'm listening! You were talking about troubles with your love life, right? I heard everything you said.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 02a 1.ogg Nabiya: Ah, well... A—Actually, they have many names. Which names I use depends on my mood.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 03.ogg Nabiya: Ahem, so which fortune do you want me to read for you today? You must have come for another echo of the divine voice of wisdom.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 04.ogg Nabiya: A mess?
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 05.ogg Nabiya: I hear you... No problem at all. Uh, the gods will reveal the truth.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 06.ogg Nabiya: ...
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 07b 1.ogg Nabiya: Oh! Uh, please pay no mind to those kinds of details.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 08.ogg Nabiya: The gods are asking...
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 09.ogg Nabiya: "Setaria, why haven't you gone home?"
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 10.ogg Nabiya: "Setaria, why don't you just go home!" It's a demand now, instead of a question... The gods seem to be truly upset.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 11.ogg Nabiya: Hmph, what an inconsiderate and naive question. The god who is speaking to me is, of course, the wisest and mightiest of all: King Deshret.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 12.ogg Nabiya: What insolence! I am King Deshret's most loyal believer. Do you wish to refute his voice of wisdom?
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 13.ogg Nabiya: Ah, wait...
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: Let's quietly follow her. Once she starts talking to her acquaintances, we'll find a safe spot to begin possessing them.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: As for how we'll sway her to our side... I'll leave that to you. (Traveler), I trust you'll know what to say.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nahida 03.ogg Nahida: Well done, (Traveler)! Setaria didn't seem to suspect anything amiss.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: To have something she's been trying desperately to avoid show up out of nowhere and berate her... That must have shaken her to the core.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nahida 05.ogg Nahida: All I know are some abstract Haravatat theories. In any case, my time with you has shown a lot of them to be utterly useless. I'm still trying to make sense of everything...
Media:vo xmaq101 7 nahida 06.ogg Nahida: Anyway, enough of that. Let's hurry and catch up to Setaria.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ooh, here she comes! Setaria's here!
Media:vo xmaq101 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ahh, Paimon's starting to feel kinda nervous! Okay, let's go!
Media:vo xmaq101 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Looks like they've already started talking... Let's find a hiding spot and get started!
Media:vo xmaq101 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Whoa, she just ran off in a hurry. She looked pretty upset, too!
Media:vo xmaq101 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Nahida, it seems like you understand human emotions really well after all!
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 01.ogg Setaria: ...That's right, you really can't force anything when it comes to love. And besides, everyone around me has a very different background and outlook...
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 02.ogg Setaria: Huh? Are you still listening to me, Nabiya?
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 03.ogg Setaria: Ah, okay then. You just seemed a little distracted for a moment there.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 04.ogg Setaria: Strange... Your cats seem pretty worked up. Is something wrong?
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 05.ogg Setaria: I always thought they were quiet, happy kitties... Oh, what are their names again?
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 06a 1.ogg Setaria: Hmm, are you sure? Those aren't ringing a bell for some reason...
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 06a 2.ogg Setaria: Huh, I see. I imagine that must be hard for the kitties, too.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 06b 1.ogg Setaria: Ahh, that's right! They are just little darlings, aren't they? Harut and Marut...
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 07.ogg Setaria: Hmm... I'd like to get another reading on my love prospects, but to be perfectly honest with you, I feel like I've been a real mess recently...
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 08.ogg Setaria: Well, erm... Could you do a reading on how long it'll take me to finish my current project at work? I really just want to get it over with...
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 09b 1.ogg Setaria: Pfft... Sorry, your new laugh is just so hilarious, I couldn't help it...
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 10.ogg Setaria: Why haven't I gone... home? Do the gods really know everything I've been thinking about...?
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 11.ogg Setaria: Ah! Ah... I'm sorry, I know I failed the gods. Please pass on my most sincere apologies and ask for their divine forgiveness...
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 12.ogg Setaria: And, if I may ask... Nabiya, is there a specific god who's speaking to you right now?
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 13.ogg Setaria: K—King Deshret? No wonder he would make such a demand of me... Huh, wait a second... King Deshret passed away a long time ago...
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 14.ogg Setaria: Even though news of King Deshret's resurrection has been spreading like wildfire, it's all just a misinformation campaign from the Akademiya... How can King Deshret still exist in real life?
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 15.ogg Setaria: Oh, no, no... As a child of the desert, I am only reveling in his power upon learning that his divine glory has touched even this city.
Media:vo xmaq101 7 setare 16.ogg Setaria: I will think very carefully about his demand of me... I'm sorry, I must go now.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 akim 01a 1.ogg Akim: Erm... Well, uh, you see, a friend told me that the secret to self-improvement is to work on things you're not so good at.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 akim 02b 1.ogg Akim: Uhh, he... sprained his arm a while back while trying to show off his strength. I thought you'd heard.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 akim 03.ogg Akim: Yeah, he's been retired there for a while.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 akim 04.ogg Akim: Oh? So who are you siding with in all of this? The Akademiya or King Deshret?
Media:vo xmaq101 8 akim 05.ogg Akim: *sigh* I'm so jealous of you — you were born a child of the desert. Yet, you chose to betray King Deshret, and now you spend all your time with those crooks from the Akademiya...
Media:vo xmaq101 8 akim 06.ogg Akim: What's so strange about becoming a believer of the wise King Deshret? In fact, aren't you the strange one — the one who still can't pick a side?
Media:vo xmaq101 8 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: You really zeroed in on the issue and put it right in front of her. It might feel a bit overwhelming for Setaria...
Media:vo xmaq101 8 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: But once everything is over, I'll be sure to pay a visit to her mind and explain everything. Anyway, let's keep going.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: She's at Akim's now, right on cue! Let's get ready to possess him right away!
Media:vo xmaq101 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whoa, (Traveler)! Paimon had no idea you'd be so good at this.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 01.ogg Setaria: ...It's okay, I just got caught up in something.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 02.ogg Setaria: Oh, actually, didn't you ask me to help you look for work? What kind of work were you looking for again?
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 03a 1.ogg Setaria: Gardening? But don't you hate everything to do with plants? I still remember getting mad at you for secretly throwing away the bonsai that I gave you as a present.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 03a 2.ogg Setaria: ...Fair enough. I didn't think that was something you would consider.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 03b 1.ogg Setaria: Oh, right, your old man's craft... How could I forget?
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 04.ogg Setaria: Speaking of, how's he doing? Is he feeling any better?
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 05a 1.ogg Setaria: Ah, that's good to hear. I've been thinking a lot about him... If I could get some more time off, I'd love to pay him a visit.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 05b 1.ogg Setaria: Huh? Wasn't he nursing a leg injury? If I recall correctly, his strong arms had always been his pride and joy.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 06.ogg Setaria: Actually, while we're talking about him... Is he still living in Port Ormos?
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 07.ogg Setaria: If you could find the time, please write him a letter. Let him know that recently, faith in King Deshret has taken root in Port Ormos, and has begun to spread across Sumeru...
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 08.ogg Setaria: He has a quick temper, and has always been a devout follower of the Dendro Archon... I don't want him to get into a fight with those King Deshret believers because of a difference in beliefs.
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 09.ogg Setaria: Uh, I...
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 10.ogg Setaria: Akim...? You don't mean... You've also become a believer of King Deshret?
Media:vo xmaq101 8 setare 11.ogg Setaria: C—Can't pick a side... Me?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: She can no longer justify everything to herself...
Media:vo xmaq101 9 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: This is the most important part of all. Quick, get ready!
Media:vo xmaq101 9 nahida 03a.ogg Media:vo xmaq101 9 nahida 03b.ogg Nahida: (Traveler)'s execution was ingenious. (He/She)'s the one who deserves all the praise.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: Well, now that we've made plans to meet again tomorrow evening, all we can do is pray for Setaria's mission to go off without a hitch.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 nahida 05.ogg Nahida: Me? No, no. The truth is the true guardian of scholars — I've always believed that. Anyway, let's meet again tomorrow evening at the Adventurers' Guild.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: C'mon (Traveler)! Setaria's already started talking with Qishan!
Media:vo xmaq101 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Even now, Setaria's still trying to run from her problems...
Media:vo xmaq101 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hey, she's trying to talk to the guards! What should we do?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Just as Nahida predicted, we've managed to bring Setaria to our side...
Media:vo xmaq101 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Pray? But if we're going to pray to the gods, aren't we just praying to you, God of Wisdom and guardian of the scholars?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 qishan 01b 1.ogg Qishan: Uh, well... The restaurant recently added an attic. I've been studying there because it has better lighting.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 qishan 02.ogg Qishan: Oh right, speaking of strange things...
Media:vo xmaq101 9 qishan 03.ogg Qishan: I celebrated the Sabzeruz Festival so many times that I lost count. That was really weird.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 qishan 04.ogg Qishan: Are you still failing to realize that the Akademiya's lowly tricks could never deceive all of Sumeru's citizens?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 qishan 05.ogg Qishan: What an absurd question. You make it sound like I should be ashamed for becoming a believer of King Deshret.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 qishan 06.ogg Qishan: In reality, shouldn't you be the one who is ashamed? You, who worked side-by-side with the Akademiya and treated people as nothing more than experimental subjects?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 rima 01.ogg Rima: Please, try to remain calm, miss. Tell me, what's happening in the city?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 rima 02.ogg Rima: Heretics? What kind of heresy are you talking about?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 rima 03.ogg Rima: Miss Setaria... Nothing is impossible.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 rima 04.ogg Rima: King Deshret is immortal, and all who defy him will one day pay the price.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 rima 05.ogg Rima: You must face the truth, Setaria. You tread a treacherous path, and the longer you ignore it, the tighter the Akademiya's grasp on you will become, and the deeper you will be ensnared.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 rima 06.ogg Rima: Child of King Deshret, never forget that the desert that belongs to you lies elsewhere.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 rima 07.ogg Rima: You won't necessarily lose your research opportunities by facing the truth. Besides, did you really want to conduct your research while carrying such heavy feelings of guilt?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 rima 08.ogg Rima: That's not important. The important thing is to pass judgment on the Akademiya and its sages, and to correct their mistakes.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 rima 09.ogg Rima: If you could provide some assistance in this matter, perhaps it could serve as a form of atonement.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 rima 10.ogg Rima: Ahem... How much do you know about the sages' current activities?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 rima 11.ogg Rima: To fight against the Akademiya, we will need to figure out the nature and the purpose of their work. Is there a way for us to get access to the confidential documents you mentioned?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 rima 12.ogg Rima: The Akademiya entrance... Wouldn't that be too conspicuous?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 rima 13.ogg Rima: Alright, I trust you.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 rima 14.ogg Rima: Umm... That'll depend on the judgment of the Dendro Archon.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 01.ogg Setaria: ...So, Qishan, have you noticed anything weird in the city lately?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 02.ogg Setaria: Like... as if someone was trying to preach to you about something.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 03b 1.ogg Setaria: Wait, did you just say attic? I thought this place didn't have an attic... Also, don't you usually study in the basement?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 04.ogg Setaria: Wait, how could you be aware of that!? That should be impossible. Nothing in the report indicated anything like that...
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 05.ogg Setaria: ...
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 06.ogg Setaria: ...Qishan, don't tell me that you've converted to King Deshret as well?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 07.ogg Setaria: Please... Please stop!
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 08.ogg Setaria: ...Mercenary, you're a member of the Corps of Thirty, correct? Please help me pass a message to the matra right away. The situation in the city is getting out of control...
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 09.ogg Setaria: Heretics are infiltrating the city, and they've already converted many residents to their side...
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 10.ogg Setaria: King Deshret! Many people I know have suddenly started believing in him, but he's long dead... It's impossible...
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 11.ogg Setaria: Y—You know my name?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 12.ogg Setaria: ...
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 13.ogg Setaria: *sigh* ...It seems that no matter where I run, I only keep finding more believers of King Deshret. I have to say, this is a familiar feeling...
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 14.ogg Setaria: I've also been running from my guilt this whole time... Guilt over my part in the sages' plans, and from ignoring the letters from the children of my homeland.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 15.ogg Setaria: But no matter how much I may try to ignore or get rid of it, my guilt always comes back.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 16.ogg Setaria: How do you know me so well? Are you truly just a believer of King Deshret, or are you the god himself?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 17.ogg Setaria: I've actually never believed in the gods, but I've always believed in serendipity. Your appearance must be a fated opportunity for me to get out of this wretched situation.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 18.ogg Setaria: Please tell me... What can I do for you?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 19.ogg Setaria: I was just one of the designers for the Mass Dream Harvest scheme... which is what happened around the Sabzeruz Festival.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 20.ogg Setaria: But I know very little about the full scope of the overall project. I'd assume that only staff with the highest clearance would have access to those confidential documents...
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 21.ogg Setaria: I've just been working to meet the Grand Sage's specified requirements.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 22.ogg Setaria: However, there's something that's been really bothering me... I heard that a scholar who was previously expelled has returned to the city, and even the sages are still quite wary of him...
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 23.ogg Setaria: It should be possible if we're willing to take some risks. After all, I'm an assistant to the Grand Sage, and I've been working on many tasks outside of the project.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 24.ogg Setaria: One thing, though... I won't be able to transfer the documents to you through the Akasha once I get my hands on them. The sages have always closely monitored all activities within the Akasha.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 25.ogg Setaria: Hmm, let me see... Let's use the most primitive method. Send someone to pick up the documents tomorrow evening at the Akademiya entrance.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 26.ogg Setaria: Don't worry about that. I assure you, this won't be a trap.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 27.ogg Setaria: I'm only suggesting this location because it'll draw more scrutiny for me to leave the Akademiya again. It'll be safest for me to distract the guards long enough to hand you the documents.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 28.ogg Setaria: So... If I were to successfully complete this task, would it mean I've atoned for my wrongdoings?
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 29.ogg Setaria: The Dendro Archon... That's right, her people are the ones we have endangered. As the God of Wisdom, she's also the one responsible for judging and guiding the scholars.
Media:vo xmaq101 9 setare 30.ogg Setaria: ...Maybe it's time for me to find a god to believe in.
Nabiya's Cat: Meow!
Nahida: Don't worry
Nahida: Leave now
Nahida: Nor can I abandon... the people of Sumeru!
Nahida: The outcast, expelled from the Akademiya...
Nahida: The people of Sumeru City...
Nahida: We'll meet again outside of the city
Nahida: What have you done to them?
Nahida: You need to get out of here
Nahida: You're...
Paimon: At this hour of the night?
Paimon: But...
Paimon: Oh no
Paimon: That guy's a Fatui Harbinger! We can't just leave you here...
Paimon: What are all these people doing here
Paimon: What should we do!? These are all just regular people...
