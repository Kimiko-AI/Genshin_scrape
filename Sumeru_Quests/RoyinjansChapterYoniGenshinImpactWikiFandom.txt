 Marana.
 Quest DescriptionYou have located the fragments with the help of Amadhiah and Royinjan. One of them lies in a cavern deep within Devantaka Mountain...
 The Withering.
Ararycan: *sob* It's Marana. Please protect Ararycan, Nara (Traveler).
Paimon: Alright! That's the last fragment. Now all we have to do is bring these pieces to Jazari, and we can get the Amiti Device fixed.
Paimon: If Amadhiah is right, (Traveler), the fragment of the Amiti Device should be inside.
Paimon: Let's neutralize The Withering first!
Paimon: Look at the plants here. What's inside the cave wouldn't happen to be...
Paimon: Oh, and we need to tell Royinjan the story of our adventures. Should we tell him about Aranara, too?
Paimon: Seems like this thing can be combined with the one we dug up at the secret base, so it should be a fragment of the Amiti Device.
Paimon: Then we can get inside the big robot...
Paimon: We will protect you! No need to be afraid of Marana, Ararycan.
