 Do you know what it is, Cyno?
 Does he have an important role in the auction?
 Does he know anything about the smuggling?
 I didn't even notice...
 I'm sorry.
 It could be a misunderstanding.
 Maybe we should take a break.
 Only some average-looking Knowledge Capsules.
 Quest DescriptionYou repelled the chasing mercenaries and now it is time to leave for the desert.
 So that's why you wanted me to carry the tracking device...
 So, you mean...
 Some sort of marking we've never seen before.
 Step DescriptionIt is almost time. Go check if Cyno has got anything.
 Step DescriptionThe auction site is already empty, and Cyno decides to let you leave with the tracker to lure them back...
 Step DescriptionThe scorpions lying in ambush here have all been defeated. That said, there seem to be more and more forces involved...
 Step DescriptionYou are attacked by scorpions in the desert. Defeat them quickly!
 Step DescriptionYou caught a man who returned to the auction, and he invited you to Aaru Village to have a talk.
 There's nobody here.
 We should go a little further.
Media:vo cnlq002 6 paimon 02b 1.ogg Paimon: Further? But Paimon can't go another step... How about we rest here for a while.
 Yeah, this is far enough.
Media:vo cnlq002 6 paimon 02a 1.ogg Paimon: Yay! Let's rest for a little while before we go back to find Cyno!
Investigate: (A large amount of Canned Knowledge has been piled here, enough to fetch an extremely large amount of Mora at market price.)
Investigate: (The Sumpter Beast is drinking water leisurely and seems to be completely unaffected.)
Investigate: (The scattered footprints have not been completely buried by the wind and sand, but it is impossible to speculate on the direction of the merchants' escape from the footprints.)
Investigate:(Ordinary Canned Knowledge, seems to have nothing to do with the Court of Desolation.)
Media:vo cnlq002 1 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: We still have a long way to go, so you'll need to hang in there for a while longer. This is not a good place to rest, anyway.
Media:vo cnlq002 1 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: Of course, but I'm accustomed to these conditions.
Media:vo cnlq002 1 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: Just try to stay focused â€” use your willpower to support your mind. The moment you start to give in is when you'll feel more tired.
Media:vo cnlq002 1 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: Take one step after another. Don't let your mind perceive your body's limitations. We must get somewhere safe before we can relax.
Media:vo cnlq002 1 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Watch out, something's not right about them...
Media:vo cnlq002 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So... hot... If only there was some shade for us to cool off under...
Media:vo cnlq002 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: *pant* Okay... But don't you feel hot too, Cyno?
Media:vo cnlq002 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Care to share any tips? Paimon's about to melt away...
Media:vo cnlq002 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Uh okay, if you say so. But where would be a more safe place to rest? Paimon thinks this is a perfectly safe place to stop.
Media:vo cnlq002 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Just look around, it's just sand and desert. There aren't any monsters for miles around... Whoa! Where did these scorpions come from!?
Media:vo cnlq002 2 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Those weren't just normal scorpions.
Media:vo cnlq002 2 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: See, there are marked numbers on their pincers. They were raised by someone.
Media:vo cnlq002 2 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: Someone doesn't want us to show up at the auction. These scorpions were sent to keep us away.
Media:vo cnlq002 2 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: We are surrounded by desert as far as the eye can see. If we were killed out here, nobody would ever know.
Media:vo cnlq002 2 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Something's not right... There are no roads in the desert, so how could they know where we are?
Media:vo cnlq002 2 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: Stay still, (Traveler).

Media:vo cnlq002 2 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: Here's the answer... They must have planted this on you.
Media:vo cnlq002 2 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: A miniature tracking device made by the Kshahrewar. They can use this to discern your approximate location.
Media:vo cnlq002 2 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: But this device wasn't licensed for mass production. Where did they get it... Could someone from the Kshahrewar also be involved? Hmm, but that doesn't seem right...
Media:vo cnlq002 2 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: They probably planted it on the Traveler during our fight with the mercenaries earlier.
Media:vo cnlq002 2 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: It was a frantic fight. It's only natural you didn't notice the device.
Media:vo cnlq002 2 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: Hmm, no... Hold on to it for now. It might still be useful for us.
Media:vo cnlq002 2 cyno 13.ogg Cyno: Let's keep heading to the auction. It would be dangerous to linger here any longer.
Media:vo cnlq002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Phew... Well, Paimon really didn't expect to see those here.
Media:vo cnlq002 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: This place is super dangerous! Good thing we didn't let our guard down.
Media:vo cnlq002 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh? What is it?
Media:vo cnlq002 2 paimon 04a.ogg Paimon: Whoa, Paimon never knew that kind of thing even existed! Why would it be on (Traveler)?
Media:vo cnlq002 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Well, good thing you were able to find it, Cyno! Now let's get rid of it!
Media:vo cnlq002 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: They're back again! How many of them are there!?
Media:vo cnlq002 4 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: We didn't waste any time getting here after we defeated those mercenaries. They shouldn't have been able to give any warning of our arrival.
Media:vo cnlq002 4 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: But even so, they still knew we were coming. Someone here must have been watching the tracker, and warned everyone to clear out.
Media:vo cnlq002 4 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: We search the area. They couldn't have moved all the Knowledge Capsules so quickly. There might still be something left for us to find.
Media:vo cnlq002 4 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: Did you find anything?
Media:vo cnlq002 4 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: It's possible there weren't many Knowledge Capsules containing info about the Court of Desolation, so they carried those off.
Media:vo cnlq002 4 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: But don't worry, I have another idea. (Traveler), you two start heading back the way we came. I will remain hidden here.
Media:vo cnlq002 4 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: Come back and meet me here after some time has passed. I'm sure something will come up by then.
Media:vo cnlq002 4 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: They packed up in a hurry and didn't have time to carry off all their goods. They won't just leave them here.
Media:vo cnlq002 4 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: Once they think we've left the premises, they'll be back to pick up their belongings. We just need to make sure the tracker goes far enough from here to make them assume that it's safe to come back.
Media:vo cnlq002 4 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: Yes, and don't worry, if they dare to return, I'll make sure they stay.
Media:vo cnlq002 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Weird... Is this where the auction is?
Media:vo cnlq002 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yeah, not a single soul... Maybe they're on break right now or something?
Media:vo cnlq002 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Aw, what should we do now?
Media:vo cnlq002 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Alright, let's take a good look around the area!
Media:vo cnlq002 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: No, nothing in particular...
Media:vo cnlq002 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it! We'll lure them out because they'll think we've left!
Media:vo cnlq002 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Okay, we'll start heading away and leave this place to you.
Media:vo cnlq002 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ugh... So tired... We've probably gone far enough now, right?
Media:vo cnlq002 6 paimon 02a 1.ogg Paimon: Yay! Let's rest for a little while before we go back to find Cyno!
Media:vo cnlq002 6 paimon 02b 1.ogg Paimon: Further? But Paimon can't go another step... How about we rest here for a while.
Media:vo cnlq002 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm, it's probably about time for us to head back to the auction.
Media:vo cnlq002 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Let's go, maybe Cyno's finally found some leads.
Media:vo cnlq002 7 bahari 01.ogg Bahari: Yes, impressive... You certainly live up to your reputation, Cyno. If I had any idea you were still around, I wouldn't have gotten so greedy.
Media:vo cnlq002 7 bahari 02.ogg Bahari: Once everyone knew you were coming, all the Canned Knowledge dealers abandoned their goods and fled at once. Obviously, there wasn't time to pack up everything.
Media:vo cnlq002 7 bahari 03.ogg Bahari: Since all the goods were just left here unsupervised, I thought I'd use the opportunity to come back and take what I could. You know, free merchandise is good business, but... *sigh* I suppose there's no use explaining it now.
Media:vo cnlq002 7 bahari 04.ogg Bahari: No, no, I'll talk. But before that, perhaps we can take the conversation elsewhere?
Media:vo cnlq002 7 bahari 05.ogg Bahari: If we stay here, chances are that someone will see me with you. That would put both me and my family in danger.
Media:vo cnlq002 7 bahari 06.ogg Bahari: How about my home in Aaru Village? It should be safe there.
Media:vo cnlq002 7 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: I didn't act immediately when he showed up. Rather, I laid low and observed for a while instead.
Media:vo cnlq002 7 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: He is not the primary instigator, but he is most likely one of the more important dealers here. Am I right?
Media:vo cnlq002 7 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: You must know who's manufacturing and selling the Canned Knowledge, correct? Will you tell us willingly, or do I need to make you talk?
Media:vo cnlq002 7 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: Alright. Where do you suggest we go?
Media:vo cnlq002 7 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Fine, let's head out. You can throw away the tracker now, (Traveler).
Media:vo cnlq002 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh! Looks like Cyno caught someone!
Media:vo cnlq002 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So you're the bad guy behind all this, aren't ya? Alright, tell Paimon everything you know!
Media:vo cnlq002 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh? Greedy? What do you mean by that?
Media:vo cnlq002 8 bahari 01.ogg Bahari: C'mon now, do you really think I'd try to pull anything under Cyno's watch? Seriously, what can I even do?
Media:vo cnlq002 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Listen buddy, you'd better not try to trick us!
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 01.ogg Bahari: This is my daughter, Simin. She can be a little shy of strangers.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 02.ogg Bahari: Why don't you run along now, dear? Dad needs to talk with our guests.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 03.ogg Bahari: Everyone knows Cyno in our business, but let me ask, who are you two?
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 04.ogg Bahari: To be honest, I really didn't expect to see Cyno the lone operator working with any partners. When I saw the tracker start moving away, I assumed you had decided to just go back empty-handed.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 05.ogg Bahari: But even though you caught me, I'd still urge you to stop while you still can. You should abandon this investigation.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 06.ogg Bahari: Everything from the manufacturing of Canned Knowledge, to the sales and even splitting the profits... every step of the process involves dozens, if not hundreds of people. Massive profits have brought everyone together in this business.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 07.ogg Bahari: Everyone will try their best to defend this industry that we've worked to build. It will be a long and difficult fight, even for you, Cyno.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 08.ogg Bahari: And even if you manage to win in the end, no one will thank you. If anything, you yourself might even feel remorse... Why are you so bent on putting us out of business?
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 09.ogg Bahari: *sigh*...
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 10.ogg Bahari: Ah, right. I forgot to offer tea to our guests. Thank you.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 11.ogg Bahari: That's my girl. Do we still have any sugar left? If not, I'll buy some more next time.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 12.ogg Bahari: Ahem, actually that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I was hoping to ask you for a favor.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 13.ogg Bahari: My daughter was born with a chronic disease, so she has a relatively weak heart and lungs. Even slightly strenuous exercise can cause her to faint and prove to be a life-threatening risk.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 14.ogg Bahari: That's why she's never really had any friends to play with, and why she locks herself up in her room most of the time. She has to take lots of medicine, and it doesn't come cheap.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 15.ogg Bahari: As for me, I was just an average merchant. I would wake up early and travel all around to make a profit, but the Mora was still nowhere near enough. I could only watch my daughter's health deteriorate day by day.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 16.ogg Bahari: Until one day, someone reached out and showed me a way to really make a profit...
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 17.ogg Bahari: That's right. With all the Mora I made, I could finally afford medical treatment for my daughter. Nothing made me happier than seeing her get better.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 18.ogg Bahari: There are many others like me. Smuggling Canned Knowledge might seem like an unforgivable crime to you, but to us, it's a means of survival.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 19.ogg Bahari: I wanted to tell you all this so that maybe you could understand and change your mind. Please stay out of this, Cyno. Give us a way to survive.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 20.ogg Bahari: *sigh* I somehow knew you would say that, but having your word to help my daughter is enough for me. Since you insist on continuing the investigation, you should have a look around the back of my home.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 bahari 21.ogg Bahari: You'll find some goods I received just recently. I think everything will become clear to you once you see them.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Why's that?
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: Everyone has their own reasons for what they do. I don't have to explain mine.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: Didn't you say that everyone's in it for the massive profits? That sure doesn't seem to be the case for you.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: Selling Canned Knowledge?
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: I must get to the truth.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: I can find someone to help treat your child, but I cannot turn a blind eye to the smuggling. These are two completely different issues.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: Yes, all neatly packed away and organized in boxes. To think that this is only one dealer's worth...
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: Small producers couldn't possibly support such a large quantity of goods. Hmm, could the Akademiya have a hand in this? But such a volume of goods wouldn't be able to slip through inspection...
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: Yes, that would make sense. Wait, what's this...?
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: Yes, it's a matra seal, indicating that the goods have passed matra inspection.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: I started to suspect that someone in the Akademiya might be involved when I found the tracker earlier, but how they could ship so much Canned Knowledge out of the Akademiya was still a mystery.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 13.ogg Cyno: The pieces have now all fallen into place. With this matra seal, goods can leave the Akademiya without undergoing a second inspection.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 14.ogg Cyno: Hmph, no wonder they don't want me to investigate. It turns out that a matra is behind this. Even I find it hard to believe.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 15.ogg Cyno: Could I ask you for a favor, (Traveler)?
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 16.ogg Cyno: Since all this Canned Knowledge came from the Akademiya, then it's highly likely that the knowledge regarding the Court of Desolation originated from research files stored within the Akademiya.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 17.ogg Cyno: If we can enter the repository, we can find out who accessed these files.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 18.ogg Cyno: But considering my current status, if I suddenly show up at the Akademiya now, it will only draw unnecessary attention.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 19.ogg Cyno: You'll need to be the one who checks the records. I'll write a letter to Nabil and he'll take you there.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 20.ogg Cyno: I'll also keep working here in the meantime. Although our leads all are currently pointing to someone within the Akademiya, it's obvious that they also have power outside of it.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 cyno 21.ogg Cyno: We can get more information on other dealers from Bahari. I'll stay here and make some preparations. You can come find me anytime if you uncover more info.
(Obtain Cyno's Introduction Letter)
Media:vo cnlq002 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Paimon is Paimon, and this is (Traveler)!
Media:vo cnlq002 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh no... That means that if we prevent the sale of Canned Knowledge, his daughter will...
Media:vo cnlq002 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Whoa! Look at all of this!
Media:vo cnlq002 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hey, look! These seem different from the other Knowledge Capsules we've seen. Maybe they contain knowledge about the Court of Desolation?
Media:vo cnlq002 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Sure thing, leave it to us!
Media:vo cnlq002 9 simin 01.ogg Simin: Dad, you're back!
Media:vo cnlq002 9 simin 02.ogg Simin: Oh, we have guests? Uh, hi there...
Media:vo cnlq002 9 simin 03.ogg Simin: Oh... okay.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 simin 04.ogg Simin: Here's some tea, Dad... and for the guests, too.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 simin 05.ogg Simin: Don't mention it... And, uh...
Media:vo cnlq002 9 simin 06.ogg Simin: I should tell you that our tea tastes kinda bitter, but I put some sugar in to make it a little tastier.
Media:vo cnlq002 9 simin 07.ogg Simin: Yes, we do... Okay, I'm gonna go have a rest now.
Media:vo dialog cnlq002 bahari 01.ogg Bahari: If you start sniffing around the Akademiya, it won't be long before people catch on to you.
Media:vo dialog cnlq002 bahari 02.ogg Bahari: And once word gets out, they'll soon be after my daughter and I.
Media:vo dialog cnlq002 bahari 03.ogg Bahari: *sigh* Alright...
Media:vo dialog cnlq002 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: There's no time to lose. Leave as soon as you're ready.
Media:vo dialog cnlq002 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: Don't worry. I'll find them before things escalate that far.
Media:vo dialog cnlq002 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: But if you still feel uneasy, then why don't you tell me about anyone else you know who was involved. The more information I have, the safer you will be.
Media:vo dialog cnlq002 simin 01.ogg Simin: I just want to get better... I don't want to be stuck at home by myself anymore.
You go to the back of the house with Cyno.
You sit and rest for a while nearby.
