 ...
 ...I missed you.
(The Traveler hugs Paimon)
 ...This was not a happy memory.
 A "Sinner"...
 Alberich!?
 And despite that...
 Belong to Chlothar Alberich.
 But I've never met you...
 But it was right here...
 But one thing is clear:
 But the Abyss is sinister and dangerous...
 But why?
 Eide, are you okay?
 Eide...
 He's not in here...
 He's not responding...
 He's relapsed...
 Hold on, something's not right with him...
 I also wish that I could know...
 But one thing is clear:
 ...This was not a happy memory.
 I didn't see clearly...
 I need to know what lies buried in this field.
 I think that the bones of the man...
 I... have a story to tell you.
 It all happened hundreds of years in the past...
 It was just a memory...
 It's gone...
 Let's just get back.
 Maybe he ran off?
 My (sister/brother) ultimately sided with him, didn't (she/he)?
 Oh, Paimon... one more thing:
 Perhaps he did...
 Quest DescriptionThe previous events might have been mysterious, but miraculous. Caribert's consciousness has returned, and his mind is whole again. However, might this achievement bear a price yet unknown...
 Stop it, Eide!
 Stop. Or the Forest Rangers and I will have to make you.
 That could well have been Caribert!
 That seems unlikely...
 The founder of the Abyss Order... Alberich...
 The voice that I heard inside my head?
 Then we have to find him first...
 There's no time to lose...
 There's something I need to check.
 There's still hope!
 Uh-oh...
 We couldn't have both seen the exact same illusion.
 We found him!
 We're done. You can open your eyes now.
 What (she/he) thought about all of this.
 But one thing is clear:
 ...This was not a happy memory.
 What do you mean, "true identity"?
 What does the broken mirror mean?
 What happened to Caribert?
 What happened to him?
 What has that strange power done to him?
 Yes... Oh, I almost forgot...
 You can't be!?
 You mean...
 You're right about this being from the Abyss...
 You're turning into a zealot...
(Traveler): (Hmm? But... hasn't the mirror been broken this whole time?)
(Traveler): (There's that term again... the "Loom of Fate"...)
(Traveler): (What happened... did I faint? I remember Caribert taking his mask off, but then...)
(Traveler): ...
(Traveler): What did he just... call me?
After some time, you and Dainsleif discover what is buried in the field...
Both sides calm down for now, thanks to your urging...
Caribert: ...
Caribert: It's all... it's all too much, Papa...
Caribert: Papa, I can't take it...
Caribert: Papa...
Cutscene's Travel Log summary:
Caribert cannot accept the cruel revelation and takes off his mask in utter grief. Then, some immense energy impacts your psyche, and thus, you pass out...
(Caribert begins to glow with purple energy)
Caribert: Papa...
Eide: Caribert...
Caribert: ...
Caribert: Papa, I can't take it...
Eide: Please, Caribert, it's my fault. I'm so sorry... If only I'd known...
Caribert: It's all... it's all too much, Papa...
(Caribert pulls off his mask and purple energy bursts out)
(Cinematic ends)
(Back in the house)
Cutscene's Travel Log summary:
You are bewildered by how Chlothar just addressed you. You pick up the mirror on the table, only to see the face of your sibling reflected in the shattered glass. Only then do you realize that everything you witnessed previously was the experience of your twin. Then you hear Dainsleif calling from outside the door. It's time for you to wake up.
(The Traveler stumbles back)
(Traveler): What did he just... call me?
(The Traveler picks up the mirror from the table only to see their sibling's reflection)
(The Traveler, now appearing as their sibling drops the mirror in shock and recalls all the events with Eide as the sibling)
Dainsleif: ...Traveler...
Dainsleif: ...Hey, Traveler!
(The Traveler, still as their sibling, breaks out of their spell and turns to face the door)
Dainsleif: Traveler!
(Cinematic ends)
Dainsleif: ...Hey, Traveler!
Dainsleif: ...Traveler...
Dainsleif: Traveler!
Eide: Caribert...
Eide: Please, Caribert, it's my fault. I'm so sorry... If only I'd known...
Media:vo szaq204 1 eide 01.ogg Eide: No, impossible... What happened?
Media:vo szaq204 1 eide 02.ogg Eide: The hilichurl worshipers have disappeared, too...
Media:vo szaq204 1 eide 03.ogg Eide: Was it all an illusion?
Media:vo szaq204 1 eide 04.ogg Eide: That's true... Yes, it can't have been an illusion. I still feel that awesome and wondrous power flowing through my mind and body...
Media:vo szaq204 1 eide 05.ogg Eide: It was neither illusion, nor coincidence, and certainly no dream! It was a wonder... yes, a divine wonder.
Media:vo szaq204 1 eide 06.ogg Eide: ...Let's go, Traveler. There is surely a reason for its disappearance... And I do believe that some day in the future, we shall see it again.
Media:vo szaq204 1 eide 07.ogg Eide: Could he really have been a "Sinner," and not a god...?
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 01.ogg Dainsleif: What happened while you were unconscious?
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 02.ogg Dainsleif: I checked the Ley Lines nearby. It appears that the Abyss tampered with them, and they've been in turmoil ever since...
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 03.ogg Dainsleif: Information and memories flow within the Ley Lines... What did you witness?
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 04.ogg Dainsleif: You mean Chlothar Alberich?
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 05.ogg Dainsleif: After founding the Abyss Order, his faith in the Abyss led him to do a great many things.
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 06.ogg Dainsleif: But the curse of immortality continued to torment his body and mind, and in the end, neither his faith nor the Abyss he worshiped could save him.
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 07.ogg Dainsleif: After a hundred years, he lost his mind completely, and was never seen again.
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 08.ogg Dainsleif: Yet his dark legacy lived on... The Defiled Statue that we encountered previously was just one perverse product of his use of Abyssal power during his life.
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 09a.ogg Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 09b.ogg Dainsleif: You could say that. (She/He) wouldn't be the Abyss Order's (Princess/Prince) otherwise.
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 10.ogg Dainsleif: ...
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 11a.ogg Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 11b.ogg Dainsleif: So, you saw (her/his) memories from centuries ago... through your own eyes. It all but defies belief.
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 12.ogg Dainsleif: Still, as I'd suspected, the notion of the "Loom of Fate" did indeed rear its head during that time...
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 13.ogg Dainsleif: And it seems closely connected to Chlothar Alberich's son, Caribert, and what happened to him...
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 14a.ogg Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 14b.ogg Dainsleif: And yet your (sister/brother) never breathed a word of this incident to me... I wonder, was that the moment that (she/he) decided to go down this path...?
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 15.ogg Dainsleif: Indeed. Clearly, this series of events sparked a long period of deep contemplation. This... was where it all began.
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 16.ogg Dainsleif: What is it?
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 17.ogg Dainsleif: ...You mean, here? Well, let's start digging and see.
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 18.ogg Dainsleif: A male and female skeleton, buried together...
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 19.ogg Dainsleif: Interestingly, the male skeleton appears to have been interred much later... and it's holding a silk scarf in its hand.
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 20.ogg Dainsleif: But what does this mean? And how did you know that there were bodies buried here?
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 21.ogg Dainsleif: What? That's impossible...
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 22.ogg Dainsleif: Unless... Chlothar Alberich finally found a way to rid himself of the curse.
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 23.ogg Dainsleif: ...
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 24.ogg Dainsleif: This all raises far too many questions... I need time to think. And to search my memories for some missing pieces...
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 25.ogg Dainsleif: We should part ways here.
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 26.ogg Dainsleif: It's better that we split up for now... I think that "he" might have seen you.
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 27.ogg Dainsleif: Yes. I have my suspicions as to his identity, but I need to confirm some other details before I can be sure.
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 28.ogg Dainsleif: If the time is right, I will tell you when we next meet.
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 29.ogg Dainsleif: I fear that while these things would limit anyone else... they are no obstacle to him.
Media:vo szaq204 10 dainslaif 30.ogg Dainsleif: Alright, let's leave it there. Get some rest... Goodbye.
Media:vo szaq204 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: ...You're awake! Oh, thank goodness, you're awake!
Media:vo szaq204 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon was worried sick! ...Uh, (Traveler)? (Traveler)?
Media:vo szaq204 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Are you alright? You have a troubled look on your face... What happened?
Media:vo szaq204 10 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: The field? What does that have to do with anything...
Media:vo szaq204 10 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: ...You scared the dook outta Paimon. D—Did you re-bury them yet?
Media:vo szaq204 10 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Huh? You're just gonna leave? Why? You could come with us, y'know.
Media:vo szaq204 10 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Who's "he"?
Media:vo szaq204 10 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: But what do you mean that he "saw" (Traveler)? How is that possible?
Media:vo szaq204 10 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: What? Why? ...What IS he?
Media:vo szaq204 10 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: There goes Dain. And just like that, it's back to being the two of us again, huh?
Media:vo szaq204 10 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Hmm? What is it?
Media:vo szaq204 10 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Huh!?
Media:vo szaq204 2 eide 01.ogg Eide: Caribert? Where has he gone!?
Media:vo szaq204 2 eide 02.ogg Eide: Oh no, no, no... Maybe someone else came by and found him?
Media:vo szaq204 2 eide 03.ogg Eide: No, no, it can't have been that. There's no sign of a break-in, and no sign of anyone having been here...
Media:vo szaq204 2 eide 04.ogg Eide: This does not bode well. What if he's spotted by a Forest Ranger? Or an adventurer? In his current state, they'd...
Media:vo szaq204 2 eide 05.ogg Eide: Wait a minute... This isn't how we left it...
(The box on the table is open)
Media:vo szaq204 2 eide 06.ogg Eide: Oh no, did he...
(A mirror is face-down on the floor)
Media:vo szaq204 2 eide 07.ogg Eide: ...
Media:vo szaq204 2 eide 08.ogg Eide: The mirror... it's broken...
Media:vo szaq204 2 eide 09.ogg Eide: He must've taken his mask off... and seen what he looks like beneath it...
Media:vo szaq204 2 eide 10.ogg Eide: Ugh, if he'd just done as he was told... We have to find him!
Media:vo szaq204 3 eide 01.ogg Eide: It's his scarf... he dropped it.
Media:vo szaq204 3 eide 02.ogg Eide: Looks like we're going the right way. Come on.
Media:vo szaq204 4 eide 01.ogg Eide: Caribert...! Caribert...! Where are you?
Media:vo szaq204 5 eide 01.ogg Eide: Curses... Forest Rangers.
Media:vo szaq204 5 eide 02.ogg Eide: Have you seen a hilichurl? A hilichurl should have come past this way... have you seen it?
Media:vo szaq204 5 eide 03.ogg Eide: I said... have you seen... a HILICHURL!!!
Media:vo szaq204 5 eide 04.ogg Eide: You... you...!
Media:vo szaq204 5 eide 05.ogg Eide: Forest Ranger scum! You spawn of The Seven are all the same! I'll have your heads if you so much as laid a finger on Caribert!
Media:vo szaq204 5 ranger 01.ogg Forest Ranger: Hey! Who are you? We haven't seen you around before. What's your business here?
Media:vo szaq204 5 ranger 02.ogg Forest Ranger: I asked you first... Don't make this more difficult than it needs to be!
Media:vo szaq204 5 ranger 03.ogg Forest Ranger: Hey, whoa... Look, Sir, there's no need to get so worked up...
Media:vo szaq204 5 ranger 04.ogg Forest Ranger: There are hilichurls everywhere, what's the big deal? We see plenty of them out here...
Media:vo szaq204 5 ranger 05.ogg Forest Ranger: You...! You're raving mad! You've got some gall, coming here to our nation, insulting the Forest Rangers!
Media:vo szaq204 5 rangerguard 01.ogg Ranger Guard: Exactly. Matter of fact, we just took out a few of them back there. Those dumb boneheads...
Media:vo szaq204 7 eide 01.ogg Eide: Curse you all, Forest Rangers...
Media:vo szaq204 7 eide 02.ogg Eide: You...
Media:vo szaq204 7 eide 03.ogg Eide: He'd only just regained his mind. How could you do this to him...
Media:vo szaq204 7 eide 04.ogg Eide: So tell me, Forest Rangers... Did you really spare none of them? Did you really take out every last hilichurl you saw?
Media:vo szaq204 7 eide 05.ogg Eide: Yes! Wonderful... Wonderful. Let's go! We have to find him!
Media:vo szaq204 7 ranger 02.ogg Forest Ranger: Wait, you're leaving? Not even a "Thanks for the info, goodbye"?
Media:vo szaq204 7 rangerguard 01.ogg Ranger Guard: I don't get it. Why make such a huge fuss over a few hilichurls...? It makes no sense...
Media:vo szaq204 7 rangerguard 02.ogg Ranger Guard: Geez, you're really not gonna let this go... Fine, you weirdo. If you must know, I happened to cross paths with a solitary hilichurl when I left the team to, uh... use the toilet.
Media:vo szaq204 7 rangerguard 03.ogg Ranger Guard: I was frightened at first, but it didn't seem to have any interest in me at all. It was just bumbling along, in... that direction. So I left it alone.
Media:vo szaq204 8 eide 01.ogg Eide: Caribert!
Media:vo szaq204 8 eide 02.ogg Eide: Caribert, stop! It's me! It's Papa!
Media:vo szaq204 8 eide 03.ogg Eide: Whatever you saw, it was... it was all a trick! An illusion!
Media:vo szaq204 8 eide 04.ogg Eide: I told you, we're in a fairytale world now, nothing here is real... Please, Caribert, come back... it's time to go back!
Media:vo szaq204 8 eide 05.ogg Eide: Caribert?
Media:vo szaq204 8 eide 06.ogg Eide: How could this happen? He regained his mind... He must be able to hear me, surely?
Media:vo szaq204 8 eide 07.ogg Eide: Come, Caribert, we have to go home now... Papa's here to take you home, alright?
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 01.ogg Eide: ...Haha, I see, I understand now...
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 02.ogg Eide: Finally, it all makes sense...
(The Traveler awakes and sits up on the bed)
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 03.ogg Eide: Aha, Traveler, you're awake... Finally, we can rejoice together!
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 04.ogg Eide: Wait, no... Why am I still calling you "Traveler"? I have known your true identity for some time now.
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 05.ogg Eide: Hehehe... I suspected it was you from the beginning! I had to talk to you to be sure.
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 06.ogg Eide: Oh, of course you haven't. With your status? You can hardly be expected to know all of us.
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 07.ogg Eide: In any case... I've been using a fake name this entire time. "Eide" is the name of a servant I once had...
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 08.ogg Eide: My real name is Chlothar...
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 09.ogg Chlothar: ...Chlothar Alberich.
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 10.ogg Chlothar: You saw it too, didn't you? Unmistakable... The power inside Caribert and the power of the one you call a "Sinner," it was one and the same...
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 11.ogg Chlothar: I am positive now... it's the power of the Abyss, isn't it?
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 12.ogg Chlothar: At long last, I have seen it with my own eyes...
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 13.ogg Chlothar: That is no business of yours!
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 14.ogg Chlothar: A sinner... Yes, salvation for a sinner can only come from a sinner...
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 15.ogg Chlothar: Caribert did not deserve his fate, but now... It's wonderful — he will be able to weave his own destiny anew.
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 16.ogg Chlothar: Born into abject sorrow, he shall now become...
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 17.ogg Chlothar: ..."The Loom of Fate."
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 18.ogg Chlothar: ...
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 19.ogg Chlothar: ...Sinister? ...Dangerous?
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 20.ogg Chlothar: I never imagined that you, of all people, would deny the Abyss... How ridiculous!
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 21.ogg Chlothar: We once believed that you would bring new strength and hope to Khaenri'ah.
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 22.ogg Chlothar: To us, you were the Abyss... A wondrous mystery far beyond our imagination and comprehension...
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 23.ogg Chlothar: ...And the one who controls the Abyss can control everything!
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 24.ogg Chlothar: We yearned for that future. We looked to you to take us there.
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 25.ogg Chlothar: But what did you bring us instead?
Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 26a.ogg Media:vo szaq204 9 eide 26b.ogg Chlothar: O (Princess/Prince)... of Khaenri'ah?
You take Eide, who seems to be in a trance, back to the small house...
Your words send Dainsleif deep into thought...
