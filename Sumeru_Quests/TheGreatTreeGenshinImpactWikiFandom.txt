(Talk to Yasmin)
Yasmin: Looks like it does need some proper care...
 What are you doing?
Yasmin: You are... Huh. Judging by your looks, you must be a traveler, yes?
Yasmin: I'm Yasmin, a student from Amurta. I'm here to study the Divine Tree.
Yasmin: The years this Divine Tree has seen exceed the total amount of rice grains contained in all the pilaf in Port Ormos.
Yasmin: It also holds the Akademiya up. It can be said to be as important as the vegetables at the bottom of Tandoori Roast Chicken.
 What kind of simile is this...
 This is your kind of analogy, eh, Paimon?
Paimon: Yeah, it is a great tree indeed...
Yasmin: If anything untoward were to happen to it, Sumeru City in its entirety would face terrible disasters.
Yasmin: It might be harried by pests, or locusts bigger than a roof might rush out from the inside...
Yasmin: Or the branches might go into a growing frenzy, and the roots might sprout outward like floods from the earth, destroying every house in its path.
Yasmin: Or maybe the Divine Tree might wither so very quickly that its trunk falls on half of Sumeru City, crushing everything there...
 Th—Those things aren't really gonna happen, right!?
Yasmin: Oh, of course. Or at least, everything has been totally fine so far.
Yasmin: But then again, it's not like the fungal beasts will warn you in advance before attacking you while you gather mushrooms in the forests.
Yasmin: That's why I'm here: to observe the tree and prepare for any incidents that might come our way.
Yasmin: But as you can see, my thoughts are as swift as a Dusk Bird, yet my strength is as feeble as a Starshroom.
Yasmin: So, Traveler, could you help me record the condition of the Divine Tree's roots at a few locations?
Yasmin: Usually, I hire adventurers to go with me, but no one seems to have been available this time around...
 Leave it to me.
 Do you researchers all talk like that...
Yasmin: Eh? Are you referring to the similes I'm using? Sorry about that. It's just how I talk...
Yasmin: People in the Akademiya have also talked to me about this, but I can't just change at the drop of a hat!
Yasmin: I'm counting on you this time. I'll be waiting for you here.

(Talk to Yasmin)
Yasmin: Traveler, what a coincidence. We meet again.
 Are you still doing your research?
Yasmin: Yes. Ladep and Pharez requested more data, so here I am, continuing my work.
Yasmin: That said, I wonder how those roots are doing right now...
Yasmin: Traveler, if you would, please help me record the conditions of the Divine Tree roots once again.
 Are you still doing your research?

 Quest DescriptionA student named Yasmin seems very concerned about the state of the Divine Tree before her.
 This is your kind of analogy, eh, Paimon?
Paimon: Yeah, it is a great tree indeed...
 Th—Those things aren't really gonna happen, right!?
 What are you doing?
 What kind of simile is this...
Paimon: Anyway, let's drive them away first.
Paimon: Bah, those spiders were so annoying! Come on, let's record the condition of the roots real quick, so we can get outta here as soon as possible.
Paimon: Gah, these spiderwebs are everywhere... Agh! Big spiders! Hurry, take them down, quick!
Paimon: Hooray, goodbye, Fungi! Hurry, let's record the condition of these roots.
Paimon: Phew... Finally, some peace and quiet over here. Hurry, let's record the condition of the roots down.
Paimon: So many Fungi... Why are they gathering here?
Paimon: Wah! Bugs! What are these bugs? Chase them away! Quick!
Paimon: Yeah, it is a great tree indeed...
Yasmin: (Everything is normal...)
Yasmin: ...Oh, if there are living creatures gathered there, then the area should still be full of vitality.
Yasmin: Anyway, here's your payment. Thanks for your help.
Yasmin: But as you can see, my thoughts are as swift as a Dusk Bird, yet my strength is as feeble as a Starshroom.
Yasmin: But then again, it's not like the fungal beasts will warn you in advance before attacking you while you gather mushrooms in the forests.

Yasmin: So, Traveler, could you help me record the condition of the Divine Tree's roots at a few locations?
Yasmin: That means that the roots of the Divine Tree should be able to grow steadily without any serious problems for now.
Yasmin: That said, I wonder how those roots are doing right now...
Yasmin: That's why I'm here: to observe the tree and prepare for any incidents that might come our way.
Yasmin: The only concern... is the possible eutrophication of the surrounding water bodies, which might nourish more Fungi...
Yasmin: The years this Divine Tree has seen exceed the total amount of rice grains contained in all the pilaf in Port Ormos.
Yasmin: Traveler, if you would, please help me record the conditions of the Divine Tree roots once again.
Yasmin: Traveler, what a coincidence. We meet again.
Yasmin: Usually, I hire adventurers to go with me, but no one seems to have been available this time around...
Yasmin: We'd best have Ladep and Pharez monitor the concentration of elements nearby...
Yasmin: Yes. Ladep and Pharez requested more data, so here I am, continuing my work.
Yasmin: You are... Huh. Judging by your looks, you must be a traveler, yes?
Yasmin: You're back. How are the Divine Tree roots?
You describe the condition of the roots to Yasmin...
