 Me too.
 Probably.
 Quest DescriptionYou have an appointment with Tighnari tomorrow morning. Best to go tell Katheryne about the contaminated area first.
 So the real reason you stayed back was to...
 Step DescriptionTighnari should be in Pardis Dhyai. Head over and look for him.
 Step DescriptionYou've completed the commission concerning the contamination area, but can't help thinking about Karkata. Go to Pardis Dhyai tomorrow morning and have a look.
After leaving the Adventurers' Guild, Paimon takes you to a quiet place...
Early Photo: (A photo of Tighnari and Abattouy. Abattouy had a bright smile in this one.)
Early Photo: (One of the many group photos. Tighnari always has the same expression and doesn't seem to be interested in taking pictures.)
Early Photo: The photo next to Karkata...

Early Photo: The photo that was put aside...

Media:vo dialog tnllq004 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: When people at the Akademiya included me in a group photo, they would also send me a copy.
Media:vo dialog tnllq004 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: I have zero interest in group photos, but I also wouldn't just throw them away. I stored them all in a box.
Media:vo dialog tnllq004 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: After coming back yesterday, I looked through them and found one with Abattouy. I gave it to Karkata, and it seemed happy... That's good enough.

Media:vo tnllq001 karkata excite 01.ogg Karkata: Kalu! Kalu!
Media:vo tnllq001 karkata excite 01.ogg Karkata: Kalu! Kalu!
(Quest ends)
Media:vo tnllq001 karkata happy 01.ogg Karkata: Kolu!
Media:vo tnllq004 1 katheryne 01.ogg Katheryne: I see. Thank you for your hard work.
Media:vo tnllq004 1 katheryne 02.ogg Katheryne: Once the excess Ley Line energy dissipates from the air, we should be able to make an announcement for residents to resume their normal activities.
Media:vo tnllq004 1 katheryne 03.ogg Katheryne: This is the stipulated reward. Please accept it.
Media:vo tnllq004 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: ...Anyway, so the contaminated region turned out to be a Ley Line effluence deep in the forest. Things are already getting back to normal.
Media:vo tnllq004 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Is Karkata... going to be sent back to the Akademiya?
Media:vo tnllq004 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: It's already damaged, but Paimon feels sad thinking about it getting disassembled.
Media:vo tnllq004 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh! Then how about we find Tighnari tomorrow and ask him to not do that?
Media:vo tnllq004 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Paimon really wants to go right now, but Tighnari said that we would "discuss matters tomorrow." We'll probably make him mad if we go now, huh?
Media:vo tnllq004 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Alright then! We'll find Tighnari tomorrow and tell him not to disassemble Karkata!
Media:vo tnllq004 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: How are you feeling (Traveler)? Sleep well?
Media:vo tnllq004 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: We should go find Tighnari... Um... How do you think we should ask him...?
Media:vo tnllq004 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Tighnari—
Media:vo tnllq004 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Karkata!?
Media:vo tnllq004 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Y—You didn't disassemble Karkata?
Media:vo tnllq004 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: But Paimon thought you said, "According to the Akademiya's policies"...
Media:vo tnllq004 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hehe, that's great!
Media:vo tnllq004 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Wait, you just said "life form." You recognize Karkata as a true living being now?
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Shh, keep your voice down.
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: The Lilac Daphne, a daphne of the genus Thymelaeaceae, has a strong anticonvulsant effect. Can be made into an anesthetic powder...
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Extrapolating from these two data sets, it would be particularly potent against piscine species... Hey, make sure you're getting all this down.
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: I thought I told you all to keep your voices low. Plants aren't afraid of noise, but your shouting is making my ears ring.
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: Why would I do that?
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: So that's why you two barged in like barbarians at this hour. Fine, I suppose I wasn't clear enough about this yesterday.
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: What I meant was, according to the Akademiya's policies, all products of research must be destroyed. That's why we can't let the Akademiya discover that place.
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Anyway, the first thing I did was repair Karkata. During my time at the Akademiya, I took an elective course at the Spantamad. Who knew it would prove useful one day.
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: We then buried Abattouy together. After organizing the research materials, I kept some as a souvenir, most of it was burned to hide the evidence.
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: I'm not with the Akademiya, so what do their policies have to do with me? On the other hand, I am the Forest Watcher of the Avidya Forest. I have a duty to protect all life in the forest.
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: All life brought forth in this world has meaning, and Karkata is no exception. If it exists, then it shouldn't be carelessly abandoned or destroyed.
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 12.ogg Tighnari: The possibility exists is all. It's hard to explain Karkata's efforts to "repair" Abattouy.
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 13.ogg Tighnari: Abattouy only left behind a small portion of his research. Who knows how many commands he installed.
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 14.ogg Tighnari: Maybe a conflict between all those commands resulted in this sort of behavior.
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 15.ogg Tighnari: From a more rigorous perspective, it is impossible to conclude that Karkata is a real life form, but the possibility exists — I am willing to believe in that.
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 16.ogg Tighnari: By the way, I'm not interested in continuing research on this subject. I'm just letting it hang out here because this place is relatively secluded.
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 17.ogg Tighnari: But as things stand now, it wouldn't be a bad idea to make it my research assistant. At the very least, it can record my experiments.
Media:vo tnllq004 3 tighnari 18.ogg Tighnari: What do you think?
