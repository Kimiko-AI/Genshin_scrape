 (It's still too early to trust him completely...)
 (What if that whole story was just made up?)
 (Where did he come from...?)
 ...
 Alhaitham!?
 But that doesn't mean I'm going to stand by and do nothing.
 Did you join forces with me just so you could investigate me?
 Did you participate in the sages' big project?
 From the very beginning, Alhaitham was...
 Haypasia was also nearly exiled to the desert.
 Her stamina is also something else...
 I can't share what I know just yet.
 I don't trust him as much as you seem to think.
 I'll help, too.
 Is it a mission from the sages?
 Is that enough to prove his innocence...?
 It is indeed quite impressive...
 It must have been Nahida's power.
 It'll be fine. Dehya and the others are here, too.
 It's a pleasure to meet you.
 Lesser Lord Kusanali was actually the one who protected the village.
 Let's head there together then.
 Neither of them can afford to be distracted by Dehya...
 Not only is she really strong...
 Now that you mention it, things did go like that...
 Only she could be capable of that...
 Please help him, Cyno.
 Quest DescriptionYou have temporarily lost Nahida's help, but according to the message she left behind, you will meet someone in the desert who can help you get out of the woods. To foil the nefarious plot between the Akademiya and the Fatui, you set off on another journey.
 She also saved me once not long ago.
 So you did lie to us.
 So you then decided to exile yourself?
 So, you were actually looking for me?
 Sorry for all the trouble.
 Sounds good.
 Thanks, Alhaitham.
 That mad scholar's power likely came from Lesser Lord Kusanali.
 That's why this is a great opportunity to watch him.
 The sages were watching me from the very beginning...
 The situation is a little complicated.
 They're still looking for an opportunity to attack...
 Tighnari also brought this up before...
 Truly awe-inspiring.
 We couldn't have shaken them without you.
 We saved Sumeru City together in the not-so distant past.
 What about your encounter with me?
 Why do they refer to the mad scholars as Village Keepers?
 You betcha!
 You have my gratitude.
 Your grandpa will be found safe and sound.
(Traveler): ("Lucid grandpa" was probably Nahida... She must have soothed the other mad scholars as well.)
(Traveler): (From the look on Cyno's face, he's probably connected the dots as well.)
(Traveler): (It must be because I was so shocked to hear those words again... "world... forget me...")
???: *growl*
???: Hmph!
After a while, the winds outside begin to calm.
Alhaitham: ...Cyno
As you approach the village chief's house, Cyno asks Isak to wait nearby.
Cutscene's Travel Log summary:
Just as you march forward with your companions in tow, someone comes at you, striking with a spear, and soon gets himself into a fight with Alhaitham. After a few rounds, Alhaitham recognizes the attacker — Cyno, General Mahamatra of the Akademiya.
(The Traveler, Paimon, and Alhaitham walk towards Aaru Village when they are suddenly attacked)
???: Hmph!
(Alhaitham and the attacker start to fight)
Alhaitham: ...Cyno
Cyno: Tsk...
(Cinematic ends)
Cyno: Tsk...
Media:vo xmaq103 1 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: ...Enough gawking. Come on, follow me.
Media:vo xmaq103 1 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: Over here.
Media:vo xmaq103 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We've finally made it to Caravan Ribat. It's pretty lively here!
Media:vo xmaq103 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So just past this wall is the desert, huh...
Media:vo xmaq103 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh wow, Paimon remembers hearing people call this the Wall of Samiel. It's made to block sandstorms from the outside... If it's this tall, it's gotta be the divine work of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, right?
Media:vo xmaq103 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh...?
Media:vo xmaq103 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Alhaitham went that way — let's hurry up and follow him. Wonder what he's up to...
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: You were too careless. You should have noticed those hopeless amateurs trailing you a long time ago.
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: There's no need to thank me. I've never cared to keep track of personal favors.
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: All I did was correct a mistake I happened to come across. It's a habit I developed at the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: Oh, so you've already landed yourselves on the Akademiya's hit list? Haha, I can't say that I didn't expect it.
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: However, had I wished to turn you over to the Akademiya, don't you think you'd already be the Eremites' honored guests by now?
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: I have no interest in running errands for that project. As a scholar, I've always belonged to the camp that promotes researcher autonomy.
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: And these days, you are more fascinating than anything the sages can offer.
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: Hmm, not quite. To tell you the truth... I'm still investigating the Divine Knowledge Capsule. Unfortunately, I've run into some difficulties.
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: Everyone says the capsule originated in the desert and was eventually moved to Port Ormos. If I am to get to the bottom of this, I must understand how the capsule first came to be.
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 10.ogg Alhaitham: Which brings me back to you, and why you're so interesting.
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 11.ogg Alhaitham: The leader of Ayn Al-Ahmar used the Divine Knowledge Capsule right in front of you, and upon seeing him, your expression became perplexed, and you were lost in thought for quite some time.
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 12.ogg Alhaitham: To have that kind of reaction, I think you must have realized something. Are you interested at all in sharing what you've been hiding from me?
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 13.ogg Alhaitham: So that's your answer... Well, I do work for the Akademiya after all. So considering that, it is indeed wise to keep your cards close to your chest.
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 14.ogg Alhaitham: But that does prove you do have some undisclosed information about the Divine Knowledge Capsule. Am I right?
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 15.ogg Alhaitham: No matter. Rather than simply learning the answers from you, I'd still prefer to investigate on my own. Speaking of, you two are also headed to the desert?
Media:vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 16.ogg Alhaitham: Then I'd suggest starting with Aaru Village. It's the largest settlement in the desert, so it'll probably have more resources and intel than anywhere else. Well? Would you like to head there together?
Media:vo xmaq103 2 membera 01a.ogg Media:vo xmaq103 2 membera 01b.ogg Eremite Mercenary: What the? Where did (he/she) go!?
Media:vo xmaq103 2 membera 02.ogg Eremite Mercenary: Ugh, how did we lose 'em? They were just here a second ago...
Media:vo xmaq103 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: More Eremite mercenaries? Who're they working for this time... Anyway, Traveler, it seems like we were being followed again!
Media:vo xmaq103 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: You really gave Paimon a scare, Alhaitham! We never thought we'd run into you here.
Media:vo xmaq103 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Last time we met at Port Ormos, didn't you say you were going back to the Akademiya? Wait... don't tell Paimon that you're here to take us back on their orders!
Media:vo xmaq103 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, right... You do have a point.
Media:vo xmaq103 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Alhaitham, you really have a ridiculous eye for detail! What kind of person even notices and remembers stuff like that...
Media:vo xmaq103 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: That's right, we have the same plan as you. But we don't really have any concrete goals at the moment...
Media:vo xmaq103 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: It's always better to travel with someone you know. Let's go!
Media:vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: Before us lies Aaru Village, the safe haven of the desert folk.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: Unless my memory fails me, we have barely spoken two words to each other before now at the Akademiya. Would you care to enlighten me as to when and how I invited the General Mahamatra's wrath?
Media:vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: "Judgment"? So, that's how you'd characterize your actions here, is it? Or would "elimination" perhaps be a more accurate description?
Media:vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: Seemed to me more like your own personal touch.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: Yes... General Mahamatra Cyno, head of all the matra at the Akademiya. He's a formidable hunter, and the ultimate nightmare for any who have committed academic crimes.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: ...Hmph.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: Very perceptive of you... Nothing escapes a matra's senses.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: No wonder you speak with such confidence, Cyno. But I must admit, I am very curious... What does this capsule mean to you?
Media:vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: And why, as General Mahamatra of the Akademiya, are you all alone in the desert?
Media:vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 10.ogg Alhaitham: As far as I'm aware, the other matra have been speculating about your disappearance.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 11.ogg Alhaitham: Have you been given a mission that's... let's say, morally dubious?
Media:vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 12.ogg Alhaitham: If I was the real target of your mission, what was stopping you from simply using your authority and resources to judge me within the walls of the Akademiya?
Media:vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 13.ogg Alhaitham: ...
Media:vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 14.ogg Alhaitham: Alright, stop yelling.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 candace 01.ogg ???: Hey! All of you, over here, quickly! We have to take cover!
Media:vo xmaq103 3 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Alhaitham, do not think you can escape my judgment just because you managed to escape my attack.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: Had I used my full strength, not even this traveler would have been able to stop me.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: Though styled like an assassination, I sought only to ensure that my target would be unable to flee or resist. Standard practice for the matra, as well you know.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: You seem to have placed a lot of trust in Alhaitham, to the point of blocking an attack for him.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: If I were you, I'd never choose to side with him. I wouldn't believe a single word that comes out of his mouth.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: I have been pursuing this scribe for a long time. I urge you, stand back and do not seek to defend him any longer. Otherwise... there will be consequences.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: I won't waste my breath explaining things. Alhaitham, I saw it during our fight...
Media:vo xmaq103 3 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: Take it out. The Divine Knowledge Capsule you're hiding on your person. Unless you want me to retrieve it for myself?
Media:vo xmaq103 3 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo xmaq103 3 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: I should have known you'd be difficult to deal with.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo xmaq103 3 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: ...Hmph.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Ahem... Well look at you two, acting all tough and self-righteous over there.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Yeah, sure looks that way... Two giants from the Akademiya, duking it out once and for all. Not something you get to see every day, that's for sure.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Listen, I know you academic types love to fill up your big brains with self-righteous morality, and lord your empty rules and virtues over each other...
Media:vo xmaq103 3 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: But how dare you bring your petty disputes into the safe haven of Aaru Village?
Media:vo xmaq103 3 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: It seems like someone's gonna have to beat some sense into your thick skulls until you finally learn to respect these grounds!
Media:vo xmaq103 3 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: Hey! Did either of you hear a word I just said!?
Media:vo xmaq103 3 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: Tch... Another sandstorm? What's up with these recently?
Media:vo xmaq103 3 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: That sounded like Candace...
Media:vo xmaq103 3 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: ...C'mon, you two! Geez, are all you Akademiya folks such hard work? Move it!
Media:vo xmaq103 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa, this landscape is really something else. What a cool place! Let's go check it out!
Media:vo xmaq103 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh, wh—who is that, Alhaitham? Did you call him "General Mahamatra"?
Media:vo xmaq103 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Has Alhaitham done something wrong? Paimon doesn't think he's as bad as you've made him out to be.
Media:vo xmaq103 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wait, the Divine Knowledge Capsule!? Didn't it fall into the matra's hands in Port Ormos?
Media:vo xmaq103 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: You two... Ugh, what should we do, (Traveler)? Paimon feels like we can't trust either of them...
Media:vo xmaq103 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Wait, Dehya!?
Media:vo xmaq103 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Great, (Traveler), finally someone that we can trust!
Media:vo xmaq103 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: You gotta help us out here! Otherwise, these two are gonna start fighting again...
Media:vo xmaq103 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Whoa! What's going on!? The wind's so strong — is this a sandstorm!? Paimon's gonna get blown away!
Media:vo xmaq103 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Someone's calling for us, (Traveler)! This wind is too strong. Let's get over there!
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: ...
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: So they really are up to no good.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: Yes, I was indeed tasked with investigating the Traveler.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: After all, the promised reward was so great that hardly any scholar could have refused. The sage told me, "Once you've completed this assignment, I can give you a glimpse of divine knowledge."
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: Unfortunately, those academics don't know me at all.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: Their words contained one key piece of information, namely that "Divine Knowledge" indeed exists. That gave me all I needed to know.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: From my perspective, the sages are far from trustworthy. Think about it: Isn't it a little strange that they're so willing to share Divine Knowledge with anyone, even as a reward?
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: So, I began my own investigation following the lead of the Divine Knowledge Capsule. In the end, I realized my wisdom in committing to this rather than collaborating with the sages.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: Had I been less guarded, I probably would have ended up like that Ayn Al-Ahmar mercenary, incapable of remaining sane for long enough to hold a conversation.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 10.ogg Alhaitham: I'd already given up on the assignment by then. I only told the Akademiya I was waiting in Port Ormos for you to appear so that they wouldn't suspect anything.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 11.ogg Alhaitham: So it came as quite a surprise when I encountered my erstwhile target while investigating the Divine Knowledge Capsule.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 12.ogg Alhaitham: Even though I ran into (Traveler) by chance, I had no intention of providing assistance to the Akademiya. Also, you should remember...
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 13.ogg Alhaitham: You were the ones who decided to follow me and strike up a conversation after I left that tavern.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 14.ogg Alhaitham: I'm willing to apologize, if that's worth anything to you.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 15.ogg Alhaitham: I took the Divine Knowledge Capsule behind your back because I judged its existence to be a significant risk. I felt that it would be best for no one to interact with it before it had been properly studied.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 16.ogg Alhaitham: After all, curiosity often proves to be the most dangerous thing in this land.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 17.ogg Alhaitham: Have I not made myself clear? You and I are both distrusted by the Akademiya. Do you really think they would tell me anything?
Media:vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 18.ogg Alhaitham: As you wish.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 01.ogg ???: My sincere apologies, everyone. This is the home of our village chief. I will have to ask you to make do with this small room until the sandstorm dies down.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 02.ogg Candace: Please let me introduce myself. I am Candace, protector of Aaru Village.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 03.ogg Candace: Hehe, there's no need to thank me. It's only right to help each other when the weather gets rough.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 04.ogg Candace: Alright, now that we're all better acquainted, we should return to the topic at hand.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 05.ogg Candace: As a guardian charged with the responsibility to protect my fellow villagers from harm, I was observing your conflict from afar, even before the sandstorm started.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 06.ogg Candace: And now that you have set foot within Aaru Village itself, it is all the more my responsibility to make absolutely sure that you pose no threat whatsoever to us.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 07.ogg Candace: So please, have an honest and sincere conversation with one another, and put your hostile feelings to rest.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 08.ogg Candace: If anyone dares to start anything again while they are under this roof... I will not hesitate to send them out for some quality time with the creatures of the sandstorm.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 09.ogg Candace: And that goes for you too, Miss Dehya.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 10.ogg Candace: Do I make myself clear?
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 11.ogg Candace: Hehe, that's what I like to hear. So, which of you will begin?
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 12.ogg Candace: Mm—hmm, good. I'm glad to see you two clearing up your misunderstandings.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 13.ogg Candace: And now you, Dehya. I believe it's your turn.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 14.ogg Candace: Is that all? Well, I will admit that definitely sounds like your style. In that case, welcome back, Dehya!
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 15.ogg Candace: No need to worry. Now that you're no longer at each other's throats, please make yourselves at home. I'll take a quick trip outside to clear out some of those creatures in the sandstorm.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 candace 16.ogg Candace: Fighting in a sandstorm is not for the fainthearted. Anyone without extensive training in these conditions is at a disadvantage. You needn't worry.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: I have nothing to hide, so there is no shame in explaining myself.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: While Alhaitham wasn't wrong about the other matra not knowing my whereabouts, it's not because I've been assigned a morally dubious mission.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Rather... I've chosen to exile myself.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: A little while ago, I discovered that there was data missing in the Akademiya's project planning and development files. What little they did report clearly did not match the project's actual progress.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: As General Mahamatra, I had the responsibility and authority to request an audit. However, to my surprise, the person responsible for the erroneous data was none other than Grand Sage Azar himself.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: I tried to investigate the issue myself before submitting a formal audit request, but I soon found that all leads and potential pieces of incriminating evidence were carefully concealed from me.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: I began to realize that... they were cautious of me from the very beginning.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: Unsurprisingly, the Grand Sage rejected my audit request as soon as the submission reached his desk. He even said to me:
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: "The power of the General Mahamatra is granted by the sages. You have no right to judge us."
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: I realized then that to the Grand Sage, the matra are nothing more than tools for the sages to assert and maintain their control over knowledge.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 13.ogg Cyno: The vows that we took, the principles that we strive to uphold... They are meaningless to the Akademiya of today.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 14.ogg Cyno: I believed it would be wise to flee the Akademiya before the sages had a chance to take action against me. This way, they can no longer see nor predict my actions.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 15.ogg Cyno: I will never give up on this investigation... There's no need for someone else to give me power or authority. Once I find the truth, I will administer judgment by my own name.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 16.ogg Cyno: When I was investigating the matter in the Akademiya, I overheard a conversation between Alhaitham and a sage.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 17.ogg Cyno: The sages asked you to investigate a (blond/blonde)-haired Traveler. Do you dispute this, Alhaitham?
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 18.ogg Cyno: Like many parts of the project, this assignment was undocumented. Now, throw in your suspicious behavior with the Divine Knowledge Capsule, and I think we deserve an explanation.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 19.ogg Cyno: A most enticing offer.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 20.ogg Cyno: You mean that the sages originally planned to dispose of you using one of those capsules that drive people insane?
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 21.ogg Cyno: Criminals do love to talk about "coincidences."
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 22.ogg Cyno: You should be well aware, Scribe Alhaitham, that curiosity can also lead you to danger and suspicion.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 23.ogg Cyno: Answer me this: Did the sages share any information about their project with you?
Media:vo xmaq103 4 cyno 24.ogg Cyno: ...Fine. Although you haven't completely proven your innocence, I won't regard you as an enemy for now.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: ...
Media:vo xmaq103 4 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Hmph...
Media:vo xmaq103 4 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: *sigh*... Alright, we got it, Candace.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: I was supposed to be a mediator, but uh... I might've gotten a little too involved just now. Anyway, one of those two should probably start talking.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: ...Oh, sorry. Whatever the boys were talking about must have been so boring that I spaced out.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 dehya 06a.ogg Media:vo xmaq103 4 dehya 06b.ogg Dehya: Ahem... My situation is pretty straightforward. My employer, Dunyarzad of the Homayani family, is friends with the Traveler and is currently recovering from her illness at home.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: I had nothing going on, so I decided to return to Aaru Village for a visit. I was actually looking forward to a pretty exciting time getting back together with everyone here...
Media:vo xmaq103 4 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: But then I saw these two random guys in the middle of a pointless argument. It ticked me off, and things went downhill from there...
Media:vo xmaq103 4 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: That's more like it! I missed you all so much, Candace...
Media:vo xmaq103 4 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: Yeah, just leave them to Candace. Don't worry, she's as tough as they come.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 dehya 11.ogg Dehya: When you put it that way, even I'm starting to feel a little worried... Alright, let's go. We've been here long enough, and the boys are as chatty as the floor.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Well, this is pretty awkward...
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: "Hey, wanna play sardines with three people who wanna tear each other limb from limb?" "Sure, why not, sounds fun!"...
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ah... The air's so thick and heavy, Paimon can hardly keep floating anymore...
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Ah, our savior has come at last!
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Nice to meet you, Candace! The name's Paimon! Thank you so much for helping us!
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Wow... She's so gentle and caring, like a nice older sister! ...Unlike those guys over there.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Oh, uh... On second thought, Paimon may have misjudged Candace's character.
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Wait, that was you trying to be a mediator?
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Huh? Exile yourself?
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Cyno seems to have the same goal as us... We're all investigating the sages!
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Plus, now that he's no longer the General Mahamatra, he somehow feels a lot less scary!
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Well, Cyno, if that's your story, then why did you see Alhaitham as a target?
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: What!?
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Alhaitham!
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: That's true... Alhaitham helped us out at Caravan Ribat as well. Maybe he's telling the truth?
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Whoa! What was that sound?
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: C—Creatures in the sandstorm...? Uh, are you sure you don't want some backup?
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: The winds died down... That means the sandstorm's over, right?
Media:vo xmaq103 4 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: Candace still isn't back yet, though. Is she alright? Maybe we should go out and check on her.
Media:vo xmaq103 5 candace 01.ogg Candace: Yes, they just keep coming in waves... I've lost count of how many I've defeated. Before I realized it, even the sandstorm had stopped...
Media:vo xmaq103 5 candace 02.ogg Candace: Hehe, it's been quite a while since I've seen the Flame-Mane in action. I'll leave these to you then.
Media:vo xmaq103 5 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Leave this round to us! I got interrupted earlier, but now I have something to take my anger out on!
Media:vo xmaq103 5 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: I'll be sure to put on a good show! (Traveler), let's go!
Media:vo xmaq103 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa... Candace, you're still fighting? You've been out here dealing with these creatures the entire time?
Media:vo xmaq103 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Eek, here comes another wave!
Media:vo xmaq103 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ugh, here comes another wave... When are they ever gonna let up!?
Media:vo xmaq103 6 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: Everything in the natural world is inextricably connected to Irminsul. These "regional symptoms" can indeed be a reflection of Irminsul's present state.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: The matra are the ones responsible for their exile. Now that you're no longer with them, are you trying to alleviate your guilt and atone for your past sins? I'm fascinated by how you think.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 candace 01.ogg Candace: What we fought just now was probably the aftermath of the sandstorm, so we should be safe for the time being.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Sir, I am also originally from the desert, but I have not been back for some time now. May I ask if such sandstorms are common?
Media:vo xmaq103 6 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: Does your curiosity know no bounds... "Village Keeper" is how Aaru Village refers to mad scholars exiled here by the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: Most of them are scholars who lost their sanity after a period of training in the Avidya Forest.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: The Akademiya believes that their crazed mutterings may have a negative effect on the psyches of other scholars, so they're forcibly exiled to the desert... Though if you ask me, it's all a boatload of nonsense.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: ...I've had encounters with those people in the past. I'll see what I can do to help.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: Mock me if you will. But if you are guilty, I will eliminate you, regardless of my position or identity.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: I'll be grateful for the assistance. No doubt you will do a better job than some of my former subordinates.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: Let's start by finding a spot to share what we know so far.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: *sigh* Everyone in Aaru Village needs to take good care of themselves.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Uh, speaking of which, why haven't I seen a single Village Keeper since I got here?
Media:vo xmaq103 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: The creatures stopped appearing. Was that the last of them?
Media:vo xmaq103 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? Who are you?
Media:vo xmaq103 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm, another effect of Irminsul's withering...
Media:vo xmaq103 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: So... Irminsul's withering causes Withering Zones in the forest, and sandstorms and earthquakes here in the desert?
Media:vo xmaq103 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Village Keeper? Who are they? Village guards like Candace?
Media:vo xmaq103 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Is it because you're reminded of Haypasia, (Traveler)? These poor scholars, first they lose their sanity, now this... We need to help get them back home, safe and sound.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: But, uh... Is it really a good idea to tag along with Cyno? You seem like you really don't trust him.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 01.ogg ???: Well fought, everyone. No injuries, I hope?
Media:vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 02.ogg ???: Ah, my apologies, I haven't had a chance to greet you yet. I had my hands full taking care of the village's elderly and children.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 03.ogg Uncle Anpu: I am the chief of Aaru Village. Everyone usually calls me Uncle Anpu.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 04.ogg Uncle Anpu: I can't say they've always been common, but recently, the storms have become increasingly severe and frequent.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 05.ogg Uncle Anpu: Besides sandstorms, we also occasionally get earthquakes... According to an investigator who stayed in the village a while ago, these unusual natural phenomena are related to the withering of Irminsul.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 06.ogg Uncle Anpu: Alas, that's exactly what we've been trying to investigate. One by one, the Village Keepers have been mysteriously disappearing without a trace...
Media:vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 07.ogg Uncle Anpu: But no one in the village has ever seen them leave... If you're planning to stay around the village for the next few days, I'd appreciate it if you could keep an eye out for them.
Media:vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 08.ogg Uncle Anpu: Oh, you're the former General Mahamatra? You must be an expert in these kinds of investigations. Thank you for your help.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Although I've sent myself into exile, I'm still doing essentially the same things as before...
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: Do you still have any questions for me before we start our investigation?
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: One of my former subordinates told me that this title has its origins in a strange incident.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: The Akademiya has long exiled mad scholars to Aaru Village. A mysterious phenomenon exists here...
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: When mad scholars first arrive, they are as incoherent and deranged as before. But after spending some time here, they invariably begin to calm down.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: Initially, the people of Aaru Village greatly resented having to take in the mad scholars. But a strange incident one night changed that...
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: Aaru Village was struck by the strongest earthquake in living memory. Seeing buildings on the verge of collapse all around him, the then chief of the village was preparing to take everyone to safety...
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: Suddenly, he noticed a mad scholar crouching in a corner, caressing the ground with his hands. A soft, green light radiated from him, like a divine glow against the backdrop of night.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: Despite the powerful tremors that ripped through the ground that night, all the houses remained upright, almost as if they had grown roots reaching deep into the ground. In the end, not a single building collapsed, and no one was hurt.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: After that, the people of Aaru Village treated the mad scholars with greater kindness, and began to refer to them as the Village Keepers.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: In theory, they would continue wearing them so the Akademiya could still monitor their activities. With that said, the main Akasha system would no longer have any interaction with them.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: ...If you are able to draw a conclusion from this one story alone, then it appears you possess much more information than I do.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 13.ogg Cyno: So, what do you make of the story?
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 14.ogg Cyno: Really? Lesser Lord Kusanali...
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 15.ogg Cyno: Hmm...
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 16.ogg Cyno: No, it's not so much that I don't believe you, I'm just struck by your reasoning...
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 17.ogg Cyno: Lesser Lord Kusanali, the current Dendro Archon... Is she really active in Sumeru?
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 18.ogg Cyno: The Akademiya has always placed far greater importance on the late Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. They've more or less ignored Lesser Lord Kusanali, and I've never had any reason to doubt their views.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 19.ogg Cyno: In addition, I've never heard any stories about Lesser Lord Kusanali and her deeds... To me, she might as well have been a god that never existed.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 20.ogg Cyno: I've spent many years interrogating criminals, so I can easily tell when someone is lying.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 21.ogg Cyno: That look in your eyes... I've never seen that from a liar. You two really must have met Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 22.ogg Cyno: ...How can this be...
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 23.ogg Cyno: To think, our archon has been among us this entire time...
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 24.ogg Cyno: By the sounds of it... a resident of this village.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 25.ogg Cyno: Is your grandpa a mad scholar?
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 26.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 27.ogg Cyno: The person you're referring to is not a local, yet you are. Why do you call him "Grandpa"?
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 28.ogg Cyno: Ah, so you're the one who was eavesdropping on us around the village chief's house.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 29.ogg Cyno: I was planning to go out and take care of whoever it was, but I had a vague feeling that they didn't harbor any ill intent...
Media:vo xmaq103 7 cyno 30.ogg Cyno: ...Alright. But first, let's confirm the facts with Candace.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 isak 01.ogg ???: Excuse me, are you here to help me find my grandpa?
Media:vo xmaq103 7 isak 02.ogg Isak: M—My name is Isak... You'll help me find my grandpa, right?
Media:vo xmaq103 7 isak 03.ogg Isak: Hey, don't say that! Grandpa is just Grandpa. Why do you have to call him that... It's not like he's a bad person or anything.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 isak 04.ogg Isak: Grandpa is just Grandpa! He's my family.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 isak 05.ogg Isak: I heard everything you said to the village chief. Please, you gotta take me with you! I wanna find my grandpa, I swear I'll help... I won't be a nuisance!
Media:vo xmaq103 7 isak 06.ogg Isak: Sorry... I was only listening in because I wanted to know where Grandpa went, honest! If you don't believe me, you can ask Miss Candace.
Media:vo xmaq103 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: A soft, green light... A mad scholar protecting Aaru Village... Hmm, what do you make of it, (Traveler)?
Media:vo xmaq103 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon thinks so, too! Actually, Cyno, do you know if any of the mad scholars continued to wear their Akasha Terminals at Aaru Village?
Media:vo xmaq103 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, no wonder! Everything makes sense, then! Add in the fact that they calmed down... It was probably Nahida who calmed them...
Media:vo xmaq103 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: What, you don't believe us? Lesser Lord Kusanali was definitely using the Akasha to give her power to the mad scholars...
Media:vo xmaq103 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: No way, Nahida definitely exists! She's a... How should Paimon put it... She's a good archon who's kind and wise! ...Even if she says weird stuff sometimes!
Media:vo xmaq103 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Good! Then you should know that we're telling the truth!
Media:vo xmaq103 7 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Alright, now it's our turn to put our skills to good use for this investigation!
Media:vo xmaq103 7 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: But easier said than done, especially since we don't have any leads... Hmm... Maybe we can start by knocking on some doors?
Media:vo xmaq103 7 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Huh? Who are you?
Media:vo xmaq103 7 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Whoa, Alhaitham wasn't kidding about matra having sharp senses... Cyno, he's just a kid! All he wants is to find his grandpa. Let's find a way to help him!
Media:vo xmaq103 8 candace 01.ogg Candace: Ah, you're back already.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 candace 02.ogg Candace: Hehe, I had a feeling he'd go looking for you.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 candace 03.ogg Candace: Yes. Although he tried his best to stay hidden, I still noticed him eavesdropping outside the window. He really wants to get his grandfather back.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 candace 04.ogg Candace: Isak's parents were both Eremite mercenaries who rarely returned to the village after finding employment in the city. He was raised by his grandfather.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 candace 05.ogg Candace: Unfortunately, it was only a few years before his grandpa passed away. Isak was still very young at the time, so various families in the village took turns caring for him so he could survive.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 candace 06.ogg Candace: Later, an elderly mad scholar arrived at the village. Isak thought the scholar bore a striking resemblance to his grandfather, and thus often spied on the man.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 candace 07.ogg Candace: However, the scholar was unkempt in appearance and incoherent in speech. Although Isak referred to the man as his "grandpa," he was afraid and didn't dare to approach him.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 candace 08.ogg Candace: One summer night, the oft-mumbling and bumbling "grandpa" suddenly calmed down and seemed to become more lucid. He even noticed Isak hiding in the distance.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 candace 09.ogg Candace: So "Grandpa" walked up to Isak and patted him on the head. He even took Isak to the entrance of the village, where he patiently taught the boy the names of the stars, and accompanied Isak until he fell asleep.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 candace 10.ogg Candace: The next morning, Isak woke up and wanted to go find his "grandpa" again, only to realize his grandpa no longer recognized him. However, even so, Grandpa retained his calm expression.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 candace 11.ogg Candace: It's said that those who saw the scholar claimed he no longer appeared to be crazy, but appeared to be living in his own world, almost as if he were sleepwalking.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 candace 12.ogg Candace: Isak was thrilled that his "grandpa" was able to find peace, and would follow him all the time asking him things like, "Grandpa, want me to take you somewhere fun?" or "Grandpa, could you tell me stories about the stars again?"
Media:vo xmaq103 8 candace 13.ogg Candace: Perhaps. Nearly everyone who lives in the desert has some form of hardship or regret. But even so, we must still continue on with our lives.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 candace 14.ogg Candace: It's also my reason for fighting. I must continue to protect this land.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 candace 15.ogg Candace: Perhaps you are more compassionate than I gave you credit for. Please accept my thanks on Isak's behalf, Cyno.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: We just wanted to confirm something with you. Do you know a boy by the name of Isak?
Media:vo xmaq103 8 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo xmaq103 8 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: Maybe the people have always had a considerate god watching over them.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: No, nothing. As long as Isak keeps his word and doesn't get in our way, we can take him along.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Alright, let's ask the local residents some questions first.
Media:vo xmaq103 8 isak 01.ogg Isak: Ah, it's you guys!
Media:vo xmaq103 8 isak 02.ogg Isak: Really!? Wow, thank you so much!
Media:vo xmaq103 8 isak 03.ogg Isak: Yeah!
Media:vo xmaq103 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Cyno is super vigilant... Is this what all the matra are like?
Media:vo xmaq103 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? You knew this would happen?
Media:vo xmaq103 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: All this somehow just makes Paimon feel really sad... It seems like they both deserve so much better...
Media:vo xmaq103 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? What did you say, Cyno?
Media:vo xmaq103 8 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hey, Isak!
Media:vo xmaq103 8 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: We've cleared everything up! Let's go find your grandpa!
Wind: Whoosh...
