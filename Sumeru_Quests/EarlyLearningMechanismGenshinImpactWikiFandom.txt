Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 20.ogg Faruzan: Oh? Color me impressed. You figured it out so quickly!
 136 steps.

 About the collaborative project...
 By any chance, has it been very difficult for you...
 Do you have any ideas?
 How did things turn out like this?
 However, looks like recruiting students might be an issue...
 I feel like I'm in class...
 I must apologize, too...
 I see. I hadn't considered that.
 Just about.
 Looks like these early learning toys are a success.
 Oh yeah, about Anis...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: Anis? We haven't had much time to get to know each other, but she seems like a good kid.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: She's able to calmly figure out the basic principles behind something without being influenced by others.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 14.ogg Faruzan: I'll do my best to teach her over the next few days... Still, how much she learns will really depend on her.
 Why don't you take her on as your student?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 15.ogg Faruzan: Well, her interest lies in the application of mechanisms.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 16.ogg Faruzan: I do have some old knowledge to share, but if we think about the future, it's easier for her to learn the things she's interested in if she stays in Kshahrewar.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 17.ogg Faruzan: My research into mechanisms is, in a sense, a side effect of my research into ancient texts.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 18.ogg Faruzan: If she becomes my student to learn how to make modern contraptions, it wouldn't benefit either of us in the long run.
 I see. I hadn't considered that.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 19.ogg Faruzan: However, if she develops an interest in deciphering ancient texts over these next two days, that would change things.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 20.ogg Faruzan: If I successfully poach a student... those young punks at Haravatat will have one less reason to cut my budget!
 Quest DescriptionFaruzan decides to come to the aid of Acara Crafts for the sake of the children and the Akademiya's future...
 She needs about two more days...
 Should I come back in two days, then?
 So they were lured in by the promise of a different toy...
 So they were lured in by the promise of new cards...
 So, about Kshahrewar...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: You want to ask why I'm unwilling to join them, yes?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: Putting aside the fact that they're too full of themselves, I actually have no issue with their research methodologies and approach.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: After all, knowledge is either right or wrong. Superiority and inferiority do not come into the conversation. All researchers are just doing their best to shed light on the unknown in their respective fields of expertise.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: No matter what corner of the unknown they shed light on, it's a step forward for us all.
 Then why do you refuse to join them?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: Because I believe wholeheartedly in that principle.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: Even if others call my research "useless," as long as the knowledge I gain from it is accurate, it could become useful in the future.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: In the end, "useful" and "useless" are concepts that shouldn't be used to evaluate knowledge.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: When I first started deciphering ancient documents, I didn't think about how it'd be "useful" to Kshahrewar.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: That's why there's no need for me to join them to do "useful" research. I'd rather stay in Haravatat. It's much more convenient for me to access the materials I need for my research here.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: *sigh* ... Still, the funding that Kshahrewar has offered me is so hard to get in Haravatat...
 Somewhat.
 Step DescriptionFaruzan decided to make the reference book as detailed as possible... Will she be able to pique the children's interest?
 Step DescriptionFaruzan decides to come to the aid of Acara Crafts for the sake of the children and the Akademiya's future...
 Step DescriptionFaruzan has decided to make the book as simple and interesting as possible... Will she be able to get a student that she wants?
 Then why do you refuse to join them?
 Try to be accurate and detailed?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 23.ogg Faruzan: You're right. Explanations are a core part of early development, too.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 24.ogg Faruzan: By using detailed and accurate illustrations, we can impart knowledge more effectively. It would also make it easier for me to recruit students.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 25.ogg Faruzan: Thank you! I'll take your opinion into account. See you in two days.
(Proceed to A Failed Reference Book...?
 Try to keep it simple and fun?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 26.ogg Faruzan: You're right. If no one understands the reference book, it doesn't matter how detailed it is.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 27.ogg Faruzan: It's better to make it simpler and fun so that children will be interested in the subject. It'll also make it easier for me to recruit students in the long run...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 28.ogg Faruzan: Thank you! I'll take your opinion into account. See you in two days.
(Proceed to Potential Students...?)
 Why don't you take her on as your student?
 Will there be an issue with the Akademiya?
 Yes. She's still kinda busy...
After some time...
Faruzan starts to sketch and cut...
Mamdouh gathers the nearby volunteers over, and Faruzan explains the rules to them...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 anis 01.ogg Anis: Madam Faruzan...! It's really you! Did you... change your mind?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 anis 02.ogg Anis: Haha... Either way, it's good that you were willing to come.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 anis 03.ogg Anis: Now, we've given Acara Crafts many ideas over the past couple of days. However, their owner thinks that our designs are too complicated, which will drive production costs too far up...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 anis 04.ogg Anis: If you join the Kshahrewar, your budget will be as big as you want it to be! I guarantee it.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 anis 05.ogg Anis: *sigh* ...Alright. He's usually at the slope up ahead recruiting volunteers to test out his toys. Let's just head over.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Alright, calm down. Let me be clear: I'm still not all that interested in Kshahrewar. I'm just here to see how the project is going.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: After all, you're here as representatives of the Akademiya in this collaboration. The reputation of all researchers is at stake here, so I will not simply stand by should mistakes get made.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: That's expected. Students who have never had to deal with budgetary constraints probably don't understand how important it is to keep costs low. How enviable... Ahem!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: That's enough. I will not repeat myself. Take me to Acara Crafts' owner first, if you please.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 nadwah 01.ogg Nadwah: Archon be praised, I can finally send a report to my superiors! Thank you so much!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917202 nadwah 02.ogg Nadwah: I have no idea how we might have persuaded her otherwise...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 01.ogg Alia: It doesn't look like it'll take that many steps...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 02.ogg Alia: Huh? It took me over 20 steps!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 03.ogg Alia: Wait, there's more?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 04.ogg Alia: Hehe, I'm almost done. Looks like I'm the faster one this time.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 05.ogg Alia: This got a lot harder...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 06.ogg Alia: Do you have any other toys?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 01.ogg Anis: Mamdouh, the one I recommended is here!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 02.ogg Anis: These early learning toys are meant to help the Akademiya train future researchers, after all. If they're too simple, then how are they any different from regular toys?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 03.ogg Anis: I remember that, in your notes, many contraptions have managed to fulfill complex functions despite using simple parts. Maybe we can do something similar with these early learning toys...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 04.ogg Anis: Um, isn't this a little too simple? Even by the standards of an early learning toy, I mean...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 05.ogg Anis: Hmm, Pagoda Stack...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 06.ogg Anis: Mamdouh, let's just do as she says.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 07.ogg Anis: Madam Faruzan... allow me to try it as well!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 08.ogg Anis: I... think so?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 09.ogg Anis: Got it!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 10.ogg Anis: Hmm...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 11.ogg Anis: I solved it! Madam Faruzan, it takes 127 steps in total!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 12.ogg Anis: For every extra layer in the Pagoda Stack, the move order you need to consider becomes much more complex, and the number of steps required will at least double...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 13.ogg Anis: Oh, I see. No wonder you emphasized in your notes that no contraption should ever be underestimated.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 14.ogg Anis: Of course! I'd be honored!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Yes, that's me.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: So the design can't be too complicated, but it can't be too easy to play with, either? Hmm...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: The contraptions in my notes? I didn't create those. I simply took the contraptions in the ruins apart and analyzed them.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: But now that you mention it, the ruins did have things like that. Do you have a pen, paper, and scissors? I'll make a paper prototype.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: Let me explain. These three thick lines represent three poles.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: These paper strips of varying lengths represent rings of different sizes. They can be slotted onto the poles and stacked up like a tower.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: That's very simple as well. You just need to shift the "tower" from this pole to another pole.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: Of course, when moving each "ring," the paper strips in this case, you must follow one rule: You can only move one ring at a time, and you can't place a bigger ring on top of a smaller one.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: It's like building a tower. The rings in the three poles must be stacked from big to small. I name this toy... "Pagoda Stack."
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: Give it a try and you'll find out if it's simple or not. I heard from Anis that you find volunteers to try out the toys, right? Why don't we do the same for this game?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: And that's how you play this game. You can all give it a try. Let's see who's able to move the "tower" to another pole in the smallest number of steps.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: Not bad! Looks like you're all familiar with the rules now.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: Then, let's increase the difficulty. The next "tower" will be five layers tall. Now then, give it a shot.

Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 14.ogg Faruzan: Good. We'll try it one final time. This time, we'll add two more layers, making seven layers in total.

Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 15.ogg Faruzan: Mamdouh, we've still got quite a few paper strips here. Why don't you give this a go as well?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 16.ogg Faruzan: You were looking at it quite seriously just now. Are you starting to understand the principles involved?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 17.ogg Faruzan: If you want to test out your hypothesis, you'll just have to play and find out!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 18.ogg Faruzan: Ah. We don't have enough paper strips left for you, (Traveler). However, by the looks of things, you seem to have the game figured out.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 19.ogg Faruzan: Why don't you guess what the lowest number of steps needed to solve a seven-layer "Pagoda Stack" is?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 20.ogg Faruzan: Oh? Color me impressed. You figured it out so quickly!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 21.ogg Faruzan: What a shame. You were close. However, you did well for someone seeing "Pagoda Stack" for the first time.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 22.ogg Faruzan: Let's see how well they do, then.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 23.ogg Faruzan: More accurately, it will require double the steps, plus one each time. You did well. You didn't underestimate the "principles" behind it just because it's an early learning toy.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 24.ogg Faruzan: The complexity of any given contraption isn't determined by the number of parts it has. The way the parts interact and the rules behind how it operates are important too.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 25.ogg Faruzan: That's right. The rules used for "Pagoda Stack" are the simplest kind when it comes to ancient contraption-making techniques.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 26.ogg Faruzan: I could spend some time picking out all those machines that do something similar and write you a reference book.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 27.ogg Faruzan: Once that happens, you can give the volunteers the reference book and paper prototypes, and find out which toy is the most popular.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 28.ogg Faruzan: Uh, in about two days or so, I think. Anis, if you're free, can you help me with the illustrations for the reference book?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 29.ogg Faruzan: Thank you for coming here with me today. I'll walk back with you.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 01.ogg Mamdouh: Oh, so you're... uh, Madam Faruzan?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 02.ogg Mamdouh: Ah, wonderful! We haven't been able to make any progress on our collaboration recently.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 03.ogg Mamdouh: We've made many suggestions, but Miss Anis thought that those ideas were too simple and wouldn't be effective in training the mind...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 04.ogg Mamdouh: But if they're too complicated, not only will they be expensive to produce considering our production capabilities, but they won't have much broad appeal to Sumeru's children, either.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 05.ogg Mamdouh: You have an idea already? ... I suppose I should have expected as much of a respected Akademiya senior researcher. We do have those, yes. Please, help yourself!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 06.ogg Mamdouh: Oh, you're done already?

Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 07.ogg Mamdouh: Well... That is easier to make than I expected. So, how is this game played?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 08.ogg Mamdouh: That sounds way too simple. Even I feel like it's missing something.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 09.ogg Mamdouh: It's such a simple toy. There's no need to...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 10.ogg Mamdouh: Huh? Okay then...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 11.ogg Mamdouh: Do you need that many steps for something this simple? Let me try!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 12.ogg Mamdouh: If I move this small ring, then the big one won't be able to go on top of it. This is going to take more steps than I expected...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 13.ogg Mamdouh: That many? But there are only seven layers!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 14.ogg Mamdouh: I see. So even a simple toy can become complex with the right set of rules...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 15.ogg Mamdouh: Two days should be enough for us to find more volunteers. Then, we can organize a huge conference here, at which we can announce which toy we'll be making.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 16.ogg Mamdouh: You'd be most welcome! We need more people to get a healthy range of opinions. The more, the merrier!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 01.ogg Qasit: You called everyone here for such a simple toy?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 02.ogg Qasit: Ugh... fine. Let's get this over and done with so we can head back and play cards.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 03.ogg Qasit: Hehe, I only needed 18 steps!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 04.ogg Qasit: Since we're already here, why don't we just give it a try?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 05.ogg Qasit: ...What's going on? I've already moved over 30 steps, but I'm still not done yet.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 06.ogg Qasit: What, how!?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 07.ogg Qasit: I—I've lost count of how many steps I've taken! Can I restart?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 08.ogg Qasit: Yeah, when can we play with them?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 ruhi 01.ogg Ruhi: Come on, we all promised to help Mr. Mamdouh test out the new toys. He said he'd give us new Genius Invokation TCG cards!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 ruhi 02.ogg Ruhi: ...Done. It took me 19 steps.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 ruhi 03.ogg Ruhi: An extra layer shouldn't make it that much harder, right?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 ruhi 04.ogg Ruhi: Done! It took me 35 steps!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917203 ruhi 05.ogg Ruhi: This "Pagoda Stack" toy is pretty fun to play with!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 alia 01.ogg Alia: Guess all we can do is play Genius Invokation TCG in the meantime...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 anis 01.ogg Anis: Is Madam Faruzan really going to mentor me? What an honor!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 anis 02.ogg Anis: Ah, I'm sure she'll say "helping with illustrations isn't mentoring"... So, ah, don't tell her I said that.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: I'll be going then. Say hi to Tighnari and Collei for me if you can. Once everything here is settled, I'll make my way over to Pardis Dhyai as quickly as I can.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: You want to ask why I'm unwilling to join them, yes?

Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 22.ogg Faruzan: Oh, I could come up with lots of ideas. With Anis's help, two days will be enough for our work. However, I'm still undecided as to the style of the reference book's text and illustrations...

Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 24.ogg Faruzan: By using detailed and accurate illustrations, we can impart knowledge more effectively. It would also make it easier for me to recruit students.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 25.ogg Faruzan: Thank you! I'll take your opinion into account. See you in two days.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 26.ogg Faruzan: You're right. If no one understands the reference book, it doesn't matter how detailed it is.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 27.ogg Faruzan: It's better to make it simpler and fun so that children will be interested in the subject. It'll also make it easier for me to recruit students in the long run...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 28.ogg Faruzan: Thank you! I'll take your opinion into account. See you in two days.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 mamdouh 01.ogg Mamdouh: No wonder she's so well-respected at the Akademiya. When I first saw her, I thought she might be unreliable because she's so young...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 mamdouh 02.ogg Mamdouh: Ah! Don't let her know I said that. Anis warned me about that before...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 qasit 01.ogg Qasit: We need to wait two whole days before we get the new toys...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917204 ruhi 01.ogg Ruhi: It might just be all reference stuff. It'll be a loooong time before we can play with the real toys.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 alia 01.ogg Alia: I don't understand any of it at all...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 alia 02.ogg Alia: I wanna go home and play Genius Invokation TCG...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 anis 01.ogg Anis: Oh? You're here! We're just starting to set up the venue.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 anis 02.ogg Anis: I'm sorry. I think we miscalculated...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 anis 03.ogg Anis: What's the Branch Master doing here? Were you looking for us, or did something happen?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 anis 04.ogg Anis: Ah, and our booklet is practically all pictures!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 anis 05.ogg Anis: Uh, we'll probably have to send in a separate application, but it shouldn't be an issue.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 anis 06.ogg Anis: After all, this concerns safety during the exploration of ruins. It's a problem that the Akademiya is actually trying to address as well...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Hehe. My masterpiece is going to be exhibited, after all. Let's see what the Akademiya shall say about it this time!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: ...To sum up, the 24 forms of pressure-based puzzle mechanisms were used in various ruins...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: Alright, let's go to the next page. Now, I'll explain the base layer design of Elemental Monuments.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: No, you simply gave suggestions. I was the one who decided to follow through. Anis, too, was only following my instructions.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: I will find a way to make up for this error. Please give me some time. I'll write another reference book...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: Uh, yes. Who are you?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: Well, it IS designed for children...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: Y—You really think so? *cough* I mean, yes, yes, I always knew it! Knowledge will always be needed one way or another!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: !
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 01.ogg Kamal: Oh...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 02.ogg Kamal: Hmm...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 03.ogg Kamal: Excuse me, but are you the one who wrote this reference book?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 04.ogg Kamal: Haha, do I stand out that much? Well, I guess I don't look like someone who'd have anything to do with toys...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 05.ogg Kamal: Let me introduce myself. I'm Kamal, the Branch Master of Sumeru's Adventurers' Guild.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 06.ogg Kamal: Ah, I came to Port Ormos to visit some old friends. On the way over, I saw the booklet you all were handing out, so I came to take a look.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 07.ogg Kamal: Can you print a few more copies of this booklet and sell them to the Adventurers' Guild? Also, could you make full-fledged models of those paper prototypes and sell them to us as well?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 08.ogg Kamal: You may see them as toys, but to adventurers who need to deal with all sorts of machines and contraptions within ancient ruins, this booklet is a true treasure!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 09.ogg Kamal: We have many members who can't read, so books are of little use to them. What they know of handling mechanisms has been learned solely through word-of-mouth.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 10.ogg Kamal: Even if the Akademiya granted public access to all their books, there are people who can't use them...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 11.ogg Kamal: It might be a bit too difficult for children, but it's perfect for adventurers. Also, those paper strips... Uh, you called them paper prototypes?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 12.ogg Kamal: If you can make wooden versions for demonstration purposes, even the most illiterate person would be able to follow along and understand.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 13.ogg Kamal: If we can supply a model set for each branch and if each adventurer carries a booklet with them, then ruin exploration will become much safer!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 14.ogg Kamal: Then let's cut to the chase and discuss the details of our first order. The amount we're offering to pay in advance is...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 15.ogg Kamal: ...This much.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 mamdouh 01.ogg Mamdouh: We've called up everyone we possibly could have. This is going to be quite the event!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 mamdouh 02.ogg Mamdouh: Uh, well, we've prepared paper prototypes for everyone. If you're interested in the mechanisms Madam Faruzan's talked about, you're more than welcome to try them out!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 mamdouh 03.ogg Mamdouh: How did this happen...? Forget about getting opinions from others. No one even wanted to stay and try them out...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 mamdouh 04.ogg Mamdouh: Ah, you're that man-mountain who was in the crowd just now!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 mamdouh 05.ogg Mamdouh: What does the Adventurers' Guild want with these toys?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 mamdouh 06.ogg Mamdouh: Making models of contraptions for the Adventurers' Guild? To be honest, that sounds like a good avenue to explore to me.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 nazenin 01.ogg Nazenin: They sound a bit too dangerous to buy for children...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 nazenin 02.ogg Nazenin: I should go home and take care of my children...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 qasit 01.ogg Qasit: *yawn* Are we done yet? I'm falling asleep...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 qasit 02.ogg Qasit: This is no fun. Can I try another toy?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 ruhi 01.ogg Ruhi: *snore*
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 ruhi 02.ogg Ruhi: *snore*
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 servan 01.ogg Servan: Are these really toys?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 servan 02.ogg Servan: Forget it. I don't think anyone would be interested...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Have you met with Madam Faruzan yet?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: It's fine. Collei has already filled me in, more or less.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: I've also managed to settle some of the problems on my side, so I've got time to wait for Madam Faruzan to arrive.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917205 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Can you help me find out how she's faring in two days' time?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 alia 01.ogg Alia: If the mechanism was bigger, you could make a rabbit appear, right?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 alia 02.ogg Alia: Madam Faruzan, will we learn origami at the Akademiya?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 alia 03.ogg Alia: But Mom and Dad said that there are six Darshans in the Akademiya... Wait, was it seven?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 alia 04.ogg Alia: Which Darshan teaches about mechanisms and origami?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 alia 05.ogg Alia: What if we end up in a Darshan we don't like? Does that mean that we won't get to learn about the things we do like?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 alia 06.ogg Alia: Uh... Not really.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 anis 01.ogg Anis: Oh? You're here! We're just starting to set up the venue.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 01.ogg Faruzan: Hehe. My masterpiece is going to be exhibited, after all. Let's see what the Akademiya shall say about it this time!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 02.ogg Faruzan: And if we activate this little mechanism, just like that...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 03.ogg Faruzan: ...A Sumeru Rose will appear at the top of the cane!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 04.ogg Faruzan: You're applying what you learned creatively. Not bad.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 05.ogg Faruzan: Let's look at the next page. If you fold an origami bird like this, it'll fly further and more stably...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 06.ogg Faruzan: Hehe. The "principles" at play are even more important than the parts that make up a mechanism.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 07.ogg Faruzan: Ahem! Just "Madam" will do. Maybe, in the future, you may indeed get the chance to call me "Professor"...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 08.ogg Faruzan: You may wish to pay attention to these few details. Here, for example... Alright, try it again.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 09.ogg Faruzan: Of course you will. If you become a researcher, you can explore any field you like to your hearts' content.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 10.ogg Faruzan: In the future, if you want, you can even become one of my students...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 11.ogg Faruzan: Well, uh, in this case, it wouldn't be Haravatat...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 12.ogg Faruzan: Huh!?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 13.ogg Faruzan: Actually, the other Darshans do have their own specialties too. For example, Haravatat specializes in... Pay attention, children... children!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 14.ogg Faruzan: How did this happen...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 15.ogg Faruzan: ...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 16.ogg Faruzan: *sigh* No, that won't happen. Take me for example. I'm a researcher from Haravatat, but I research mechanisms, see?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 17.ogg Faruzan: The only person able to restrict your curiosity as a researcher... is you. Uh, do you understand what I'm saying?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 18.ogg Faruzan: Heh. It's alright. You still have a long road ahead of you. Now, do you want to learn about some other machines?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 faruzan 19.ogg Faruzan: Let me tell you a story about pressure-based mechanisms and Elemental Monuments.

Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 mamdouh 01.ogg Mamdouh: We've called up everyone we possibly could have. This is going to be quite the event!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 mamdouh 02.ogg Mamdouh: Everyone, we have paper prototypes and craft materials that you can use to make your own toys! Come try them out!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 mamdouh 03.ogg Mamdouh: It's fine! We have a lot of paper prototypes and craft materials! All feedback is also welcomed!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 nazenin 01.ogg Nazenin: I'm not that interested in toys, but if they'll be beneficial for children's development...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 qasit 01.ogg Qasit: Oh, I see!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 qasit 02.ogg Qasit: Whoa... you can make a mechanism using just a piece of paper?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 qasit 03.ogg Qasit: Oh! My origami bird flew further this time!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 qasit 04.ogg Qasit: I know! We need to choose Kshahrewar!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 qasit 05.ogg Qasit: I want to attend Kshahrewar in the future and fold even better origami birds!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 ruhi 01.ogg Ruhi: I thought it came out of thin air! It's amazing!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 ruhi 02.ogg Ruhi: Then you can't use a cane. Could you switch it out with a hat or something?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 ruhi 03.ogg Ruhi: But we want to play, too...
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 ruhi 04.ogg Ruhi: Uhh, Professor Faruzan, how can I make mine fly farther?
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 ruhi 05.ogg Ruhi: Wow! It really did fly farther!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 ruhi 06.ogg Ruhi: I—I wanna make even more awesome mechanisms!
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 servan 01.ogg Servan: These are pretty cool. I'm tempted to try them out.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917206 servan 02.ogg Servan: This is such a well-prepared event! I'll give it a go.
Media:vo frzcop001 1917301 alia 01.ogg Alia: (This new game's not bad, but Genius Invokation TCG is better...)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917301 anis 01.ogg Anis: (Ah, if only Madam Faruzan were willing to switch to Kshahrewar... *sigh*)
Media:vo frzcop001 1917301 mamdouh 01.ogg Mamdouh: (Surely the kids will like this one...?)
