 Alright, sounds like a plan.
 Alright...
 But we need to get to Sumeru City...
 Calm down, it's probably nothing to get worked up about...
 Exactly. We need to get to the bottom of this.
 He probably wasn't telling us the truth.
 I don't think that's the case.
 I don't think what I saw were hallucinations.
 I feel it's a little weird...
 I'm not sure.
 Let's start by having a chat with Collei.
 Maybe we shouldn't bother her.
Media:vo xmaq001 3 paimon 05b.ogg Paimon: Hmm, it looks like she's meditating or something. If we bother her now, she probably wouldn't let us off very lightly...
 No, I seem to be fine, except...
 Or maybe there's a reason she ignored us?
 Quest DescriptionYou and Paimon arrive in Sumeru, and you prepare to find a way to get an audience with Lesser Lord Kusanali...
 Something's... not right!
 Sure, let's give it another shot.
Media:vo xmaq001 3 paimon 05a.ogg Paimon: Alright then, it's not like we have anyone else we can ask... Even if she's not very friendly, we just need her to point us in the right direction, that's all.
 Thank you for the help.
 This smell, it's...
 This taste in my mouth... It's so bitter!
 Wha—!
 Where am I?
 Yeah, my body does feel a little weird, but what I mean is...
 Yes, that all makes sense.
(Traveler): (I think I'm gonna pass... out...)
(Traveler): (I've got to get out of here!)
(Traveler): (When I saw the vision, it felt as if I was standing deep underground. But the red sky... Could it have been Khaenri'ah?)
(Traveler): Ugh! Uh oh...
Cutscene's Travel Log summary:
Your vision blurs...You walk under the eerie sky, your vision blurred.You see a giant tree standing in the center of the world. When you get close to it, you hear some incoherent utterances: "World... forget me."A searing pain in your head renders you unconscious...
Media:vo xmaq001 cs2 rukkhadevata 01.ogg ...World... Forget me...
Media:vo xmaq001 1 haypasia 01.ogg Sumeru Local: Huh?
Media:vo xmaq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Now that we've made it to Sumeru, our next objective should be to head to Sumeru City and find a way to meet with Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Media:vo xmaq001 1 paimon 02a.ogg Media:vo xmaq001 1 paimon 02b.ogg Paimon: And speaking of Lesser Lord Kusanali, even though we haven't heard too much about her, she doesn't seem to be the same deity who abducted your (sister/brother)...
Media:vo xmaq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: But even so, people call Sumeru the "Nation of Wisdom," you know. If we can get a chance to meet the God of Wisdom, maybe she can give us some useful information.
Media:vo xmaq001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: But, uh... Paimon doesn't know the way to Sumeru City... Maybe we can climb up to that spot with the Statue of The Seven on it? That'll give us a way better view of things!
Media:vo xmaq001 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Even if we can't see exactly where the city is, at least we'll be able to check for some smaller settlements nearby.
Media:vo xmaq001 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Wait a second, look! There's someone up ahead!
Media:vo xmaq001 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Perfect timing! Now we can just ask for directions rather than wander around like lost adventurers.
Media:vo xmaq001 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Hey there. Uh... we're not from around here and seem to have gotten a little lost... We'd like to ask for some directions!
Media:vo xmaq001 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Huh? Did they not hear Paimon? HEY! You over there! Could you give us some directions?
Media:vo xmaq001 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: What's going on here? There's no way she could've missed that... Wait! Could she be ignoring us!? How dare she?
Media:vo xmaq001 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Hmph! Well, even so, she might be heading someplace where we could find other people to ask. Let's keep our distance and follow her!
Media:vo xmaq001 1 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: When we get the chance, we'll just ask someone else for directions.
Media:vo xmaq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: C'mon, let's follow her. Just keep quiet and make sure she doesn't notice us.
Media:vo xmaq001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh!? She just walked near that small waterfall and then suddenly vanished! Let's go take a closer look.
Media:vo xmaq001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon thought this cave would lead to a village or something, but uh, it looks like that's not the case.
Media:vo xmaq001 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Look, she's sitting over there. Wait, she couldn't possibly be living here, could she?
Media:vo xmaq001 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Uh, what should we do now? Do we try asking her for directions again?
Media:vo xmaq001 3 paimon 05a.ogg Paimon: Alright then, it's not like we have anyone else we can ask... Even if she's not very friendly, we just need her to point us in the right direction, that's all.
Media:vo xmaq001 3 paimon 05b.ogg Paimon: Hmm, it looks like she's meditating or something. If we bother her now, she probably wouldn't let us off very lightly...
Media:vo xmaq001 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Oh? Mmm! What a lovely smell!
Media:vo xmaq001 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: It's coming from that censer over there. This is definitely not your typical place to call home, but at least it smells nice! Hmm, maybe living here wouldn't be too bad after all...
Media:vo xmaq001 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Huh, what's the matter? You don't look too good.
Media:vo xmaq001 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: What? Is the smell making you feel sick? Strange, Paimon doesn't feel anything...
Media:vo xmaq001 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: What's happening? (Traveler)? This is no time for a nap! C'mon, wake up...
Media:vo xmaq001 4 collei 01a.ogg Media:vo xmaq001 4 collei 01b.ogg ???: Yes, you can relax... Believe me, Master is extremely knowledgeable. If he says that (he/she)'s going to be alright, then there's absolutely nothing to worry about.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 collei 02.ogg ???: Oh, are you awake now?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 collei 03.ogg ???: This is Gandharva Ville. It was originally built by scholars from Sumeru as a place to rest in the rainforest. Now it's mainly used by the Forest Rangers as a base of operations.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 collei 04.ogg Collei: My name is Collei. I'm a Trainee Forest Ranger. My master and I found you passed out during our patrol, so we brought you here.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 collei 05.ogg Collei: Oh n—no, no thanks are necessary! I didn't do anything, really. By the way, how are you feeling now? Any discomfort?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 collei 06.ogg Collei: Oh, haha... That's Master's herbal medicine you're tasting. He gave you some while you were unconscious.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 collei 07.ogg Collei: Before I forget, Master mentioned you should take more medicine once you wake up.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 collei 08.ogg Collei: Ah, whoops!
Media:vo xmaq001 4 collei 09.ogg Collei: Ah, sorry, Master...
Media:vo xmaq001 4 collei 10.ogg Collei: Oh, this is my master, Forest Watcher Tighnari. He is chief officer over all the rangers here in Gandharva Ville.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 collei 11.ogg Collei: Huh? W—Why?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 collei 12.ogg Collei: Uh, yes, Master Tighnari!
Media:vo xmaq001 4 nasrin 01.ogg Nasrin: Right, this is the second time he's come down with food poisoning this month. I'll be sure to give him a good talking-to!
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: ...Are you sure it's not serious? The Traveler's been out for a long time now...
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, thank goodness! (Traveler), you're finally awake!
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Well, we're at... uh... Good question, where are we!? Paimon was in such a panic when you passed out that she even forgot to ask what place this is.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wait, hold on a second! Can you tell us what's going on?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Further observation?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Whoa, are you okay?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: *sigh* Seriously, we just arrived in Sumeru. We're already having problems left and right...
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Paimon knows we were set on meeting Lesser Lord Kusanali as soon as possible, but you really don't look too good... It'd probably be best to let you recover first.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Uh, hey! Are you even listening to Paimon? Paimon's over here worrying about you, ya know!
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: What's weird? You mean how you're feeling now?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: You mean the vision of tree roots and red skies you saw? But if those weren't hallucinations, what could they be?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Well, considering how unique you are, Paimon trusts your judgment here. But why didn't you say anything about it to Tighnari?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: If he misjudged your condition, then there's a chance you could get worse, right?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Huh? You mean that Tighnari already knows that what you saw weren't hallucinations? But if that's the case, why would he try to hide that from us?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Paimon gets it now... That explains why you were so quiet earlier.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Well, that settles it, then. We'll stay here to rest up and figure out what's going on with your hallucinations.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: But it seems like asking Tighnari might not be an option anymore... What do you think we should do?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Good idea. Collei's pretty friendly... We can ask her tomorrow about what she knows regarding the Dendro Archon and customs in Sumeru.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Collei, what's the matter? Were you trying to retrieve the medicine? As I've already told you, you must be careful with these... Alright, I'll get it for you once I'm finished here.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: *sigh* Now, the "Guide to Avidya Forest's Edible Fungi" is clearly posted on our bulletin board. But, if Farbod forgets which mushrooms to avoid one more time, I'll have no choice but to leave the guide somewhere a little more visible — like right smack on his forehead so others can remind him to be careful.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Yes, please do. If, on the off-chance, Farbod simply enjoys having little imaginary fairies dance before his eyes, then we'll just let him be. But, the next time he requires any of our medicine, be sure to charge him accordingly.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: So, how are you doing? Feeling better?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: I already informed Paimon about the reason you fell unconscious earlier, but now that you're awake, let me explain it for you as well.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: It is common practice for Sumeru scholars of certain Darshans to dedicate themselves to training and meditation in isolated areas, particularly the nearby forests. While meditating, they use a certain incense known as Spirit Borneol to help calm their minds as they enter a state of deep rumination.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: In hopes of asking directions, you two followed a scholar named Haypasia into her cave. The incense you smelled inside was the Spirit Borneol I just mentioned.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: That incense typically has no effect on most people. But, for a very select few, it can have profound effects on one's cognition, as you experienced firsthand. Does that make sense?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: Very good. Now, answer me this: did you feel anything after passing out? Say, any out-of-body experiences? Or did you see anything while unconscious?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: Hmm...
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: Collei, let the others know to stop bringing their patrol logs here for now.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 12a.ogg Tighnari: Because these two will be staying here for the next few days. They can have my room, and I'll bunk with Amir. Now get a move on and be sure to do as I've said.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 13.ogg Tighnari: Sure, let me fill you in. I originally planned to send you on your way once you finished your medicine. However, it appears now that you should stay a while longer in Gandharva Ville for further observation while you recuperate.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 14.ogg Tighnari: No need to be hasty. As long as you have the capacity to judge between right and wrong, I promise that you'll understand the gravity of the situation once I explain everything to you.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 15.ogg Tighnari: Based on what you saw after smelling the incense and losing consciousness, we can conclude that you experienced a powerful hallucination, which suggests your mental state is not in the best of shape.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 16.ogg Tighnari: If you're skeptical, have a whiff of this.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 17.ogg Tighnari: You're experiencing a similar sensation as when you passed out, aren't you?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 18.ogg Tighnari: So even though your condition is stable as of now, if I were to haphazardly let you leave, it's highly likely that you'd suddenly pass out again somewhere else...
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 19.ogg Tighnari: The rainforest is home to many fierce animals and hazardous areas. If something were to happen to you again, I'm afraid you might not be so lucky.
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 20.ogg Tighnari: For now, I suggest you continue taking your medicine each day and avoid wandering off on your own, at least until you stop having adverse reactions to this kind of smell, okay?
Media:vo xmaq001 4 tighnari 21.ogg Tighnari: Good. Now continue resting while I fire up another bowl of medicine for you.
Media:vo xmaq001 cs2 rukkhadevata 01.ogg ...World... Forget me...
You describe what you saw while unconscious...
You get a night of rest...
