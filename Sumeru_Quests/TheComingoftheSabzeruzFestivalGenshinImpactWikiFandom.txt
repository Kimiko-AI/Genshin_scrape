Media:vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 06.ogg Kimiya: So, how about it? Want to give it a try?

Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 09d.ogg Paimon: Paimon bet you survived so many epic battles because you had incredible luck, and Paimon was right!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 11d 1.ogg Vihar: Atten-tion! Here's your Sunsettia-flavored candy!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 09d 1.ogg Paimon: Hehe, thanks a lot, Knight of Candies!

Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: *sigh* Paimon thought you survived so many epic battles because you had incredible luck, but looks like Paimon was wrong.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 12.ogg Vihar: The Sunsettia-flavored candy was in box number four. How about this? The most important thing is that everyone has a good time at the festival, so please take both boxes!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Really!? Thanks a lot, Knight of Candies!
 ...
 About our plans for tomorrow...
 Alright, I guess I can give it a go.

Media:vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 06.ogg Kimiya: So, how about it? Want to give it a try?
 Dehya's expression just now, when she mentioned your condition...
 Dehya's top priority is her employer's safety.
 Don't blame me if I choose the wrong one.
 Don't go. They have the final say in all of this.
 Don't say that. You still have happy times yet to come.
 Don't worry, she's tough.
 Eleazar!
 For some reason... I don't buy it.
 I doubt I'll be able to get the exact flavor you want...
 I'll keep you company tomorrow.
 I'm sure she knows that very well.
 If we force their hand too much, the situation may get ugly.
 Instead, we were only left with more questions...
 Is there anything else we can do?
 It'll be easier to get information with your help.
 It's a very important festival, after all.
 It's definitely number five.

 Professional here, ready to go.
 Quest DescriptionSabzeruz Festival is about to begin. As agreed, you return to Sumeru City to find Dunyarzad and take part in the festival together.
 Right.
 She's protecting you because she agrees with you.
 Should we try to think of another way?
 Sorry for the trouble, Dunyarzad.
 Sure thing.
 That's a wonderful mindset.
 This entire thing is way too random.
 This may be a regret that can never be resolved.
 Unfortunately, we didn't find any new information on Lesser Lord Kusanali.
 We can't guarantee anyone's safety here.
 We'll be fine...
 Yes. I will remember you.
 You're already so strong for never giving up.
 You're the one who has remained resolute in the face of your illness.
A plan has been set in motion somewhere unknown to you...
Media:Akasha Terminal Beep.ogg ???: *beep*
Media:vo dialog xmaq008 amal 01.ogg Amal: I picked all of these from the forest yesterday, so their freshness is guaranteed!
Media:vo dialog xmaq008 guard 01.ogg Media:vo dialog xmaq008 guard 02.ogg Guard: Hey! Stop right there! No one is allowed to enter or leave Sumeru City right now. Go away!
Media:vo dialog xmaq008 kimiya 01.ogg Kimiya: The diviner's interpretation is the most important part of alchemical divination. I just consulted the book to make sure you got the correct message.
Media:vo dialog xmaq008 merchant 01.ogg Merchant: *sigh* How am I supposed to conduct business when I'm not allowed to leave the city?
Media:vo dialog xmaq008 paimon 01.ogg Media:vo dialog xmaq008 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whoa... Ugh, okay.
(The player is teleported a few steps back into the city)
Media:vo dialog xmaq008 vihar 01.ogg Vihar: Atten-tion! Young soldiers, are you here to join our ranks?
Media:vo xmaq008 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We didn't miss the Sabzeruz Festival, right?
Media:vo xmaq008 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's hurry and find Dunyarzad. Paimon thinks... she must be around the Grand Bazaar, since she showed us around there last time.
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: My lady, Traveler, found ya.
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Any more of them? Or rather, did anyone follow you?
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Oh, this? I'm fine — it's just a scratch. Normally, they wouldn't have been able to land a hit on me at all, but I'm still getting used to this new greatsword.
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: C'mon, it's nothing. Us mercs aren't as fragile as you think.
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: Uh... About that... Well... I sold it 'cause I was low on Mora. Stuff like this happens every now and then.
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: *sigh* Hehe...
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: Uh, hey, Miss Dunyarzad, I wasn't trying to make you cry. I'm not gonna lose my commission because I made my employer cry, am I?
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: Hahaha... You're so unreasonable, my lady.
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: ... *sigh* Don't be like that. I get embarrassed really easily.
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: My lady, your condition... Traveler, can you take her somewhere to rest? I'll look around the area to make sure we're safe from an ambush.
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: *cough* *cough*
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: I—I'm fine... My body always reacts like this whenever I exert myself too much...
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: Phew... I'll be fine after some rest. I'm more worried about Dehya... After all, none of this would've happened if I hadn't insisted on coming out today...
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: Dehya, your arm...!
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dunyarzad 05.ogg Dunyarzad: Please let me take a closer look...
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dunyarzad 06.ogg Dunyarzad: Hold on, you said something about a new greatsword? What happened to the one you were using before?
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dunyarzad 07.ogg Dunyarzad: It can't be... The anonymous donation that was used for the venue's final round of preparations...
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dunyarzad 08.ogg Dunyarzad: ...
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dunyarzad 09.ogg Dunyarzad: ...Pfft... Hehe... Okay, making your employer cry won't affect your commission, but selling your weapon without permission and getting hurt... I'll have to re-evaluate your performance.
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dunyarzad 10.ogg Dunyarzad: Hahaha...
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dunyarzad 11.ogg Dunyarzad: ...Thank you very much, Dehya.
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dunyarzad 12.ogg Dunyarzad: *cough* *cough*
Media:vo xmaq008 10 dunyarzad 13.ogg Dunyarzad: Truly... I'm sorry for the trouble, everyone...
Media:vo xmaq008 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Dunyarzad, are you okay? You look a little pale. Are you in shock?
Media:vo xmaq008 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: You sure you're okay...?
Media:vo xmaq008 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yeah, don't worry!
Media:vo xmaq008 10 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Dehya! You took care of 'em so fast.
Media:vo xmaq008 10 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Are you feeling unwell again, Dunyarzad?
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: *pant* Phew...
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: Yes, much better. Just give me a few moments, and I'll be good to go.
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: ...I didn't realize you were concerned about it. I guess I shouldn't continue to keep it a secret.
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: I was actually... born with Eleazar. It's terminal now.
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 05.ogg Dunyarzad: Oh? You've already heard of Eleazar. In that case, you probably know about its severity.
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 06.ogg Dunyarzad: Sumeru's current medical advancements still haven't been able to find a cure. The disease's progression can only be delayed through environmental therapy...
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 07.ogg Dunyarzad: There's no need to be sad. I've always lived with Eleazar, and I came to terms with it a long time ago.
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 08.ogg Dunyarzad: Compared to the simple fact that I am afflicted with this, its effects on my life have been much more painful.
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 09.ogg Dunyarzad: I know that my family loves me dearly. They've done all they can to provide the best environment for me, so that I can live for that much longer. However, I know... I will one day succumb to this.
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 10.ogg Dunyarzad: Did you know? Before I ran away from home this time... the world outside of my home didn't even know that I existed.
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 11.ogg Dunyarzad: Since I was a child, all I could do was sit on my bed and stare at everything outside of my window.
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 12.ogg Dunyarzad: I'm sure my family is worried and disappointed in me for running away, but I... I just didn't wanna have any regrets.
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 13.ogg Dunyarzad: I wanted to meet other people. To me, there is nothing more beautiful than being able to meet and speak with others.
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 14.ogg Dunyarzad: Not to mention the incredible time spent preparing for the festival, the joy on everyone's faces here, and all the support I've received from friends like Dehya...
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 15.ogg Dunyarzad: This way, when my final day does arrive, it will be less sorrowful.
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 16.ogg Dunyarzad: At the very least, many people will remember that I once existed in this world, right?
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 17.ogg Dunyarzad: Hehe... Thank you two so much. I apologize for the depressing conversation. This is... This is out-of-character for me.
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 18.ogg Dunyarzad: To be honest, Lesser Lord Kusanali gave me the courage to do all of this. If it weren't for her encouragement, I wouldn't have taken that first step.
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 19.ogg Dunyarzad: ...Thanks. There will always be frustrations in life, but I know that the point of living is not to leave behind any regrets.
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 20.ogg Dunyarzad: Oh, right! Isn't it almost time?
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 21.ogg Dunyarzad: Isn't the Dance of Sabzeruz about to begin? It's the part of the festival that I've been looking forward to the most...
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 22.ogg Dunyarzad: Nilou will recreate that legendary scene with her most splendid dancing, and the Sabzeruz Festival will conclude amid everyone's applause and blessings...
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 23.ogg Dunyarzad: And with that, my wish will also...
Media:vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 24.ogg Dunyarzad: ...Yeah! We should still make it in time!
Media:vo xmaq008 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Are you feeling better, Dunyarzad?
Media:vo xmaq008 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Can't believe it's Eleazar...
Media:vo xmaq008 11 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Dunyarzad...
Media:vo xmaq008 11 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: A—As long as you don't forget Paimon, Paimon also won't forget about you! Ah... No, even if you forget Paimon, Paimon will still remember you!
Media:vo xmaq008 11 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh? Almost time for what?
Media:vo xmaq008 11 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Then what are we waiting for? Let's go to the stage!
Media:vo xmaq008 12 azar 01.ogg Azar: Art... Dance... Aren't you ashamed of pursuing such frivolous and meaningless activities in this land of knowledge and reason?
Media:vo xmaq008 12 azar 02.ogg Azar: Our Archon created the utopia that is Sumeru City for all scholars who sought validity, verity, and truth... while people like you wish to defile it.
Media:vo xmaq008 12 azar 03.ogg Azar: With your lack of intellectual credentials, I do not believe you are qualified to debate with me. What you should be doing is finding workers to tear down this ridiculous eyesore.
Media:vo xmaq008 12 azar 04.ogg Azar: When we return, have the Scribe draft an ordinance before the next Jnagarbha Day that prohibits public art performances. We will announce it to the public later via the Akasha.
Media:vo xmaq008 12 azar 05.ogg Azar: ...
Media:vo xmaq008 12 azar 06.ogg Azar: The Sabzeruz Festival... Go celebrate the birth of that god to your heart's content.
Media:vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: I think I just saw the Akademiya's Grand Sage... Why is he here in person?
Media:vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: The Akademiya was originally responsible for the Sabzeruz Festival, but they've failed this responsibility for many years. I need to speak with them...
Media:vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: ...This is a hard pill to swallow, but... sigh, you're right. Things would only get worse.
Media:vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: Yeah...
Media:vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 05.ogg Dunyarzad: Nilou, it's alright. Don't worry about it.
Media:vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 06.ogg Dunyarzad: It's okay. Seeing you care this much about my feelings is more than enough.
Media:vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 07.ogg Dunyarzad: It would be too risky to continue the Sabzeruz Festival at this point. I don't want to get everyone in trouble...
Media:vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 08.ogg Dunyarzad: *sigh* The next one...
Media:vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 09.ogg Dunyarzad: ...Yes! Okay, it's a promise! It WILL be a smashing success!
Media:vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 10.ogg Dunyarzad: It really is okay. There's nothing we can do about it.
Media:vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 11.ogg Dunyarzad: *sigh* Still... I'd be lying if I said I had no regrets. I would have loved to see Nilou's dance.
Media:vo xmaq008 12 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: But the Dance of Sabzeruz is one of the key parts of the Sabzeruz Festival. If we can't perform it...
Media:vo xmaq008 12 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: How... How did things turn out like this...
Media:vo xmaq008 12 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: No, I believe that our Archon never rejected the arts. Even the Goddess of Flowers dedicated a dance to her...
Media:vo xmaq008 12 nilou 04.ogg Nilou: Oh, Dunyarzad. You all saw that just now...? The Grand Sage ordered us to stop the performance...
Media:vo xmaq008 12 nilou 05.ogg Nilou: Let's go somewhere the Akademiya can't find us and perform there... Ahh, but how do we let everyone know... And what about the atmosphere and the stage...
Media:vo xmaq008 12 nilou 06.ogg Nilou: Or we could get people to block them off so they can't interrupt the performance... Agh... No, they just threatened to investigate the organizers. If we were caught...
Media:vo xmaq008 12 nilou 07.ogg Nilou: But you've been looking forward to the Dance of Sabzeruz so much, and I know how important this festival is to you. I don't want you to have any regrets...
Media:vo xmaq008 12 nilou 08.ogg Nilou: ...If you say so, but... You can sneak out for the next Sabzeruz Festival, right? We'll make sure the next one is a smashing success!
Media:vo xmaq008 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Over there... Someone's yelling at Nilou.
Media:vo xmaq008 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Nilou, are you okay?
Media:vo xmaq008 12 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Paimon can't believe this is how things turned out. Those heartless geezers...
Media:vo xmaq008 12 setare 01.ogg Setaria: ...Were you not aware that the law prohibits this type of performance from taking place without prior permission?
Media:vo xmaq008 12 setare 02.ogg Setaria: The Sabzeruz Festival... The law also prohibits the private hosting of large-scale, religious festivals. Only the Akademiya can host such an event.
Media:vo xmaq008 12 setare 03.ogg Setaria: If you continue to resist, we will have to order an investigation into every single event organizer...
Media:vo xmaq008 12 setare 04.ogg Setaria: The Grand Sage has already granted you much leniency. I advise that you exercise tact.
Media:vo xmaq008 12 setare 05.ogg Setaria: Understood. I will inform him when I return.
Media:vo xmaq008 13 khajeh 01.ogg ???: All connections have been secured to construct the most stable framework possible.
Media:vo xmaq008 13 khajeh 02.ogg ???: The project has entered its most critical phase. Power has begun to flow from __.
Media:vo xmaq008 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: *sigh* A lot happened today... It's a shame the festival ended the way it did...
Media:vo xmaq008 13 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Nilou and Dunyarzad promised to make the next Sabzeruz Festival a success... But Dunyarzad is running out of time...
Media:vo xmaq008 13 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yeah... *sigh*
Media:vo xmaq008 2 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: *sigh* My lady, if you went to Port Ormos in your current state, we'd both be in for a lifetime of trouble.
Media:vo xmaq008 2 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Ahem, it's called covert protection! Keeping an ear out for what's going on around my employer is part of the job.
Media:vo xmaq008 2 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: ...Hm, even when you put it that way, it still doesn't feel right...
Media:vo xmaq008 2 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: Okay, fine, but only tonight. Tomorrow's a big day, and many no-good scumbags are gonna take advantage of that.
Media:vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: Just as promised, Traveler and Paimon! I'm so glad that you two came back to celebrate Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday.
Media:vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: Hehe, indeed! The festival is tomorrow. We have been preparing for so long that I can't help but feel a little nervous.
Media:vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: Hehe, thanks, Paimon. I hope that everyone who comes to the festival will also have a good time.
Media:vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: Speaking of which, did you manage to make your way to Port Ormos? Discover anything over there?
Media:vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 05.ogg Dunyarzad: *sigh* I see. Sounds like you two had another exciting adventure...
Media:vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 06.ogg Dunyarzad: ...If there is another chance, I would love to join...
Media:vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 07.ogg Dunyarzad: It's alright, Dehya. I merely said that I "would" like to go. I know better than to think my body could handle it, hehe.
Media:vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 08.ogg Dunyarzad: The festival is tomorrow. I've been doing nothing but causing trouble for you, so Dehya, please take some time to relax. I'll be fine.
Media:vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 09.ogg Dunyarzad: Don't worry, my guardian knight.
Media:vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 10.ogg Dunyarzad: Oh, you two must be exhausted from your long journey back to the city. My apologies for not realizing this sooner.
Media:vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 11.ogg Dunyarzad: I've already prepared a room for you to rest. Please follow me.
Media:vo xmaq008 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: There she is! Dunyarzad, we're back!
Media:vo xmaq008 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: There's no need to be nervous! Paimon's sure that Lesser Lord Kusanali will feel everyone's gratitude.
Media:vo xmaq008 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Of course we went! A lot of things happened there...
Media:vo xmaq008 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Dehya! You were eavesdropping!
Media:vo xmaq008 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: *yawn*
Media:vo xmaq008 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Whoa, you're so thoughtful! Paimon's so ready!
Media:vo xmaq008 3 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: Here we are. It's also fairly close to where I've been staying.
Media:vo xmaq008 3 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: Hehe, not at all. Just tell me more about your adventures when you next get the chance.
Media:vo xmaq008 3 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: Oh, if you don't mind, how about we all walk around together tomorrow?
Media:vo xmaq008 3 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: All of my friends will be working the festival, and Dehya is still insisting on her "covert" protection...
Media:vo xmaq008 3 dunyarzad 05.ogg Dunyarzad: Then let's meet at the nearby bazaar first thing tomorrow morning. Have a great night!
Media:vo xmaq008 3 dunyarzad 06.ogg Dunyarzad: I may be too excited to fall asleep tonight. See you tomorrow.
Media:vo xmaq008 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It looks really nice!
Media:vo xmaq008 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: That's Paimon's specialty! Paimon can tell you stories next time!
Media:vo xmaq008 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yeah? It'll be pretty hard to relax and enjoy the festival if Dehya's constantly hovering over you, right?
Media:vo xmaq008 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: It's a deal! Good night, Dunyarzad!
Media:vo xmaq008 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Paimon's starting to really look forward to the Sabzeruz Festival, too! Will there be lots of yummy food?
Media:vo xmaq008 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Oh no, no... Thinking about food is just gonna keep Paimon up all night. The earlier we sleep, the better. Let's go inside, Traveler.
Media:vo xmaq008 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: *yawn* Did we oversleep...?
Media:vo xmaq008 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We should go meet Dunyarzad right away.
Media:vo xmaq008 5 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: Traveler, Paimon! I've been waiting for you two.
Media:vo xmaq008 5 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: Not at all. I arrived early.
Media:vo xmaq008 5 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: Phew... Today is finally here! I must cherish every moment as if it were gold.
Media:vo xmaq008 5 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: Hehe, you know it! It's just that... as expected, I had some trouble falling asleep last night. I'm hoping my body won't be too much of an issue today.
Media:vo xmaq008 5 dunyarzad 05.ogg Dunyarzad: Well, shall we? Let's start with the stalls over there.
Media:vo xmaq008 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Good morning, Dunyarzad! We must've overslept a little bit, hehe.
Media:vo xmaq008 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: You've worked so hard for this day. You gotta enjoy it to the fullest!
Media:vo xmaq008 6 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: Many vendors came out of the blue to support the event, and they insisted on covering costs themselves. Let's go give them some business.
Media:vo xmaq008 6 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: Hehe, they all said that contributing to a lively festival atmosphere is more important than money, especially since we don't often get to celebrate Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday.
Media:vo xmaq008 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: They paid for everything out-of-pocket? Sounds like they're not in this just for the Mora.
Media:vo xmaq008 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ooh, they're selling food over that way! Let's go take a look!
Media:vo xmaq008 7 amal 01.ogg Amal: Oh-ho, you could tell straight away! I thought most people nowadays wouldn't know.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: This is... a stall offering foods from the Haft-Mewa Feast.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: It's another Sabzeruz Festival tradition. People used to set their tables with seven different foods...
Media:vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: Generally speaking, the most common selections were foods like Rukkhashava Mushrooms, Nilotpala Lotuses, Sumeru Roses, Sunsettias, Kalpalatas, Harra Fruits, and Zaytun Peaches.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: Hehe... You don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy the spread. We just use the seven foods to symbolize the seven virtues of the Dendro Archon.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 05.ogg Dunyarzad: Hahaha... I hope your wish comes true one day, Paimon.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 06.ogg Dunyarzad: Well... According to Lesser Lord Kusanali, everything is interconnected, and all that occurs can be traced back to fate. You can say this is a pearl of old wisdom.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 07.ogg Dunyarzad: Illusions and lies...? That sounds rather ominous...
Media:vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 08.ogg Dunyarzad: ...Naturally, fate will only ever show you the beginning of a journey. It is up to you to forge your own ending. Hehe, thank you so much. I'll keep that in mind.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 01.ogg Kimiya: Dear customers, would you like to try your hand at alchemical divination?
Media:vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 02.ogg Kimiya: Right? I thought the same when I first heard about it. It is said to be a mysterious craft invented by none other than Lesser Lord Kusanali herself.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 03.ogg Kimiya: It's quite simple. After you give me any two alchemical reagents, I'll use them to perform a random transmutation.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 04.ogg Kimiya: That is precisely what we need. After the transmutation fails, your one and only diviner here will interpret the remnants.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 05.ogg Kimiya: So that's the true wisdom behind it! This young lady sure knows her stuff. So, how about it? Want to give it a try?
Media:vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 06.ogg Kimiya: So, how about it? Want to give it a try?
Media:vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 07.ogg Kimiya: Okay, one moment... Hmm... It's the Moon.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 08.ogg Kimiya: Hmm... Generally speaking, the Moon signifies... It means... Wait a moment...
Media:vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 09.ogg Kimiya: Oh, I remember now. It means illusions and lies.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 10.ogg Kimiya: Yes, but this book says that if you trust your intuition and overcome your fears, the sun will surely rise.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 11.ogg Kimiya: Oh, it's nothing. I'm just learning as I go, haha... ha...
Media:vo xmaq008 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Mushrooms, flowers, and all kinds of fruit... It's all vegetarian stuff. Paimon's a little disappointed...
Media:vo xmaq008 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So what's the "Haft-Mewa Feast" you mentioned just now?
Media:vo xmaq008 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So the Sabzeruz Festival is a vegetarian holiday...
Media:vo xmaq008 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wait, but if that's the case... If Sumeru uses vegetarian food to represent the Dendro Archon...
Media:vo xmaq008 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Then wouldn't the Pyro Archon's festival be full of food like roasted fowl, juicy meatballs, grilled steak...
Media:vo xmaq008 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Traveler, we have to go to Natlan as soon as possible!
Media:vo xmaq008 7 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Thanks! Alright, how about we also check out some of these other stalls?
Media:vo xmaq008 7 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: What's alchemical divination? Those two things sound like they'd be fun to try together.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: So... how does it work?
Media:vo xmaq008 7 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Sure sounds random... So random that it'll probably fail.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Why does everything sound so much more credible when Dunyarzad says it? Are you guys working together?
Media:vo xmaq008 7 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Paimon wants to take a look too... Is it...? It looks more like a pie that Paimon bit into.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Is he really looking it up in a book...
Media:vo xmaq008 7 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: He's not even trying to hide his book anymore.
Media:vo xmaq008 7 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Guess that was still pretty interesting. Okay, on to the next stall.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 children 01.ogg Children: Farris! Farris!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 children 02.ogg Children: Hey, it's Dunyarzad!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 children 03.ogg Children: Yes, Knight Farris!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: They say the Sabzeruz Festival was very lively a long, long time ago.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: Large flower carriages used to parade through the city. As they headed towards Port Ormos, people would throw flowers, candy, and liquor all along the way...
Media:vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: *sigh* I wish I could have seen that spectacle. But if you ask me, I'm sure Nilou's Dance of Sabzeruz will be just as impressive!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: Uh... Ah, hallowed Knight of Flowers, it is an honor that you know my name!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 05.ogg Dunyarzad: Hehe. Farris, the Knight of Flowers, is another Sabzeruz Festival icon, and one immensely popular with children. In the past, the actor portraying Farris would also sit on a flower carriage.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 06.ogg Dunyarzad: As are we to you, Vihar.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 07.ogg Dunyarzad: Onikabuto is a little spicier than Lizard Tail.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 08.ogg Dunyarzad: Hehe, I also believe in your intuition.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 09.ogg Dunyarzad: Hehe... Paimon really wilted the carriage-less Knight of Flowers.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 10.ogg Dunyarzad: Oh, actually, I just remembered that I left something behind. Since you're here...
Media:vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 11.ogg Dunyarzad: Can you come with me to get it?
Media:vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 12.ogg Dunyarzad: Haha, how embarrassing.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Dunyarzad's eyes are sparkling right now!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's a weird guy with a weird hat.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Uh... Just what is going on here...
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Whichever one... Don't these boxes all look the same?
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Ooh, those all sound pretty good...
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Huh!? What's up with those two flavors?
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Dunyarzad, y—you tried them before! Hmm... Traveler, help Paimon pick one. Paimon wants the Sunsettia flavor!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: It's alright, Paimon believes in you!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 09d 1.ogg Paimon: Hehe, thanks a lot, Knight of Candies!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 09d.ogg Paimon: Paimon bet you survived so many epic battles because you had incredible luck, and Paimon was right!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: *sigh* Paimon thought you survived so many epic battles because you had incredible luck, but looks like Paimon was wrong.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Really!? Thanks a lot, Knight of Candies!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: They all basically sound the same! We got our candy, so let's keep going.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Dunyarzad, you probably forgot because you're so excited about the Sabzeruz Festival!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 01.ogg Vihar: Atten-tion! Soldiers, fall into formation if you want any Yalda Candies!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 02.ogg Vihar: Hahaha... Miss Dunyarzad, the children love you even more than Yalda Candies.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 03.ogg Vihar: In the few short days it took to prepare for the Sabzeruz Festival, the children have all grown very fond of you.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 04.ogg Vihar: A—Ah, ahem... Atten-tion! In the name of Farris, the Knight of Flowers, I commend you on your contributions to the glorious Sabzeruz Festival.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 05.ogg Vihar: Alright, little soldiers, take your Yalda Candies and don't forget your loyalty to Lesser Lord Kusanali. Dismissed!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 06.ogg Vihar: It's all thanks to Miss Dunyarzad's sponsorship that the children can make such wonderful memories today.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 07.ogg Vihar: Not at all! Oh, speaking of tradition, do you want some Yalda Candies? They're a festival staple, and I happen to have some boxes readied here. Take a look and pick whichever one you want.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 08.ogg Vihar: Haha, this is the fun part. Each box contains a random flavor — it's up to the luck of the draw. Flavors include Lavender Melon, Harra Fruit, Sunsettia...
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 09.ogg Vihar: ...And there's also Lizard Tail and Onikabuto.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 10.ogg Vihar: Great! These boxes of candy are numbered one to five from left to right. Which one do you want?
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 11a.ogg Vihar: Atten-tion! That's unfortunately Lizard Tail.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 11b.ogg Vihar: Atten-tion! That's unfortunately Harra Fruit.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 11c.ogg Vihar: Atten-tion! That's unfortunately Lavender Melon.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 11d 1.ogg Vihar: Atten-tion! Here's your Sunsettia-flavored candy!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 11d.ogg Vihar: Haha, excellent work! That is indeed Sunsettia.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 11e.ogg Vihar: Atten-tion! That's unfortunately Onikabuto.
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 12.ogg Vihar: The Sunsettia-flavored candy was in box number four. How about this? The most important thing is that everyone has a good time at the festival, so please take both boxes!
Media:vo xmaq008 8 vihar 13.ogg Vihar: It's Knight of Flowers! Not Knight of Candies!
Media:vo xmaq008 9 badis 01.ogg Badis: ...Tch, we're too late. Who knew the little lady was such an early riser.
Media:vo xmaq008 9 badis 02.ogg Badis: Oh, that most certainly is! We're in luck. She's walking right into our clutches.
Media:vo xmaq008 9 badis 03.ogg Badis: Heh, that's right. We haven't received any of their Mora, but... I wonder how much the Homayanis would shell out to get you back?
Media:vo xmaq008 9 badis 04.ogg Badis: You're... Dehya!? Dehya the Flame-Mane... No wonder we mercs haven't heard anything about you for so long. You sold your unruly mane to the highest bidder.
Media:vo xmaq008 9 badis 05.ogg Badis: Hmph, aren't your claws all dull by now? Don't get too cocky!
Media:vo xmaq008 9 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Hey! Did you scumbags even consider that the Homayanis might've hired a merc that outclasses you?
Media:vo xmaq008 9 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Don't worry about it, my lady. Just some friendly banter between mercs. One punch and those rabid dogs will expose themselves for what they really are.
Media:vo xmaq008 9 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Traveler, take Miss Dunyarzad to a safe location.
Media:vo xmaq008 9 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: Don't waste your time worrying about me — this is my job. Look out for yourself. After I've wiped the floor with them, I'll go find you all.
Media:vo xmaq008 9 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: ...Who are you? I don't believe the Homayanis hired you?
Media:vo xmaq008 9 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: Don't speak so disrespectfully. My family started working with her as gratitude for her past kindness to us...
Media:vo xmaq008 9 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: Please be careful, Dehya.
Media:vo xmaq008 9 idder 01.ogg Idder: I know, right... Hey, wait a minute. Boss, isn't that her?
Media:vo xmaq008 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Those Eremites don't look like they're up to any good...
Media:vo xmaq008 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: They're a gang of kidnappers! Traveler, hurry and protect Dunyarzad!
Media:vo xmaq008 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: No, we're gonna stay and help. There's too many of them!
Media:vo xmaq008 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hm... You're right. Alright, fine!
The Sabzeruz Festival was forced to come to an unfortunately abrupt end...
You and Dunyarzad wait nearby for a while...
