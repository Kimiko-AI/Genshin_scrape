 "The forest remembers everything."
 Aha...
 If I'm not mistaken...
 Quest DescriptionYou've located the fragments with the help of Amadhiah and Royinjan. One of them lies in a submerged cavern...
Ararycan: Ararycan doesn't know what you're talking about and Ararycan can't remember. But it's fun hanging around with little Nara!
Ararycan: Of course it is true. Ararycan doesn't deceive Nara.
Paimon: (Traveler), let's spin this thing the same way we did before!
Paimon: According to the notes, it's at the deepest part, again.
Paimon: Alright! That's the last fragment. Now all we have to do is bring these pieces to Jazari, and we can get the Amiti Device fixed.
Paimon: Ararycan claims to have moved the components back there. But that can't be true, right?
Paimon: Ararycan was the Aranara who played with the kids at the secret base.
Paimon: But Ararycan remembers nothing about this... Do Aranara forget the past too?
Paimon: Looks like there are big robot parts here, too. Gee, imagine what would happen if Jazari saw them, eh? He'd whip his Kamera out again, and that would be the last we'd hear of him for a while.
Paimon: Oh, and we need to tell Royinjan the story of our adventures. Should we tell him about Aranara, too?
Paimon: Paimon hopes you remain happy wherever you may go, Ararycan.
Paimon: Paimon remembers this. It's the Vamadha!
Paimon: Seems like this thing can be combined with the one we dug up at the secret base, so it should be a fragment of the Amiti Device.
Paimon: Then we can get inside the big robot...
Paimon: Why does Mr. Royinjan's grandpa like to go to the cave anyway?
