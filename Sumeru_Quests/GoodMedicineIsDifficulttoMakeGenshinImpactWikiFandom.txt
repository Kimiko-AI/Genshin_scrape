 Quest DescriptionZakariya seems to be having some trouble...
 Why did you modify the prescription?
 You mean he's done something like this before?
Zakariya: Yeah, I can't remember how many times. Luckily, he seldom handles poisonous ingredients. Otherwise...
 Zakariya sent me here.
Maruf drinks the medicine...
Maruf: *sigh* But I'm running out of herbs again...
Maruf: Do you remember the medicine we brewed together last time? It didn't work very well.
Maruf: Hmm, I don't think there was anything wrong with that ingredient, and I'm sure my brewing method was correct. What happened...
Maruf: I just sent someone to get some medicine for me from Dr. Zakariya, but you beat him to the punch.
Maruf: I thought I might've boiled it the wrong way or missed a few ingredients.
Maruf: I tried it first as a reasonable precaution, and I believe you know the rest.
Maruf: I've been absent for so long... Many villagers must be waiting.
Maruf: O—Okay...
Maruf: Phew... I feel much better. Zakariya's indeed a great doctor.
Maruf: So I... Um... made another bowl based on my experience.
Maruf: So you must've heard about the mess I've made. This is embarrassing...
Maruf: Thank you, Traveler. I'm going to get some rest now. After that I'll have to start receiving patients again.
Maruf: T—Traveler, what brings you here?
Traveler: What happened?
Zakariya returns inside and starts preparing the medicine...
Zakariya: *sigh* He must've done more than just adjusting the brewing method and modifying the amount of ingredients used.
Zakariya: Do you remember Maruf, the doctor from Aaru Village? He sent you to get a prescription from me last time.
Zakariya: Forget it. Perhaps he ran into some difficulties.
Zakariya: He said that the original prescription didn't work, so he sought to improve it.

Zakariya: Oh! Traveler! Come over here, I'd like to ask a favor of you.
Zakariya: Okay, now bring it to Maruf. I hope he learns his lesson this time.
Zakariya: Relax, I won't throw an entire bug into the soup, but some parts are useful.
Zakariya: Thank you very much, Traveler. I'll get the medicine ready right away.
Zakariya: The poor guy brewed a medicine, tasted it, and ended up retching and vomiting for days.
Zakariya: This is not the first time it's happened. Maruf just can't learn his lesson, can he?
Zakariya: Traveler, could you get some raw ingredients for me? I'll brew a soup myself. Please bring it to Maruf.
