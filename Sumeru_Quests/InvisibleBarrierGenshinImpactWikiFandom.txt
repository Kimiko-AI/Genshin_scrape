Paimon: Aaand yup, that's another stone slate alright.
Paimon: Let's go back to Aaru Village and have Soheil see what the inscriptions on these slates are about.

Paimon: And that's a stone slate found! Hah, Paimon can see Soheil's eyes popping right outta his head already!
Paimon: Alright, on to the next set of Transparent Ruins!

Paimon: Eh? It's just some stone bits... Where's the stone slate?
Paimon: Looks like there isn't treasure at the end of every search, huh?
Paimon: Well, there is one last set of ruins left. Let's have a look there.

Paimon: Eh? It's just some stone bits... Where's the stone slate?
Paimon: Looks like there isn't treasure at the end of every search, huh? That's kind of a letdown.

Paimon: Eh? Where's the stone slate? There's nothing here but some smashed stone...
Paimon: Gah! Paimon was disappointed before when we found the stone slate, but this has gotta be double the disappointment!

Paimon: Hehe, that's another slate for us. Paimon can see Soheil hopping up and down in excitement already!
Paimon: One last set of ruins. Let's do this!

Paimon: Hehe, that's another slate for us. Paimon can see Soheil hopping up and down in excitement already!
Paimon: Two more ruins. Let's do this!

Paimon: Hehe, that's our second stone slate. Paimon can see Soheil hopping up and down in excitement already!
Paimon: Two more ruins. Let's do this!

Paimon: Hoo, well, guess that's another stone slate after all. That was the expected result... but it was still disappointing.
Paimon: Well, we've got one last set of ruins left. That said, Paimon kinda knows what we'll find there already.

Paimon: Huh. Nothing much of a discovery here... Just some stone shards.
Paimon: Well, that was a letdown. Hopefully we'll find something more in the next set of Transparent Ruins...

Paimon: Ooh, a stone slate, and this one's got words on it! Soheil will be so excited!
Paimon: Two more ruins. Let's do this!

Paimon: Yay, a stone slate. That brings our total haul up to three!
Paimon: Let's go back to Aaru Village and have Soheil see what the inscriptions on these slates are about.
 Not yet.
Soheil: Alright. If you do find anything, please share them with me and quench my thirst for knowledge.
 Quest DescriptionSoheil's archaeological notes record his desert adventures in his youth. Some of the ruins mentioned may contain treasures and old documents. Head into the depths of the desert again to look for them.
 Step DescriptionSoheil mentioned in his notes that there were four transparent ruins that he could not enter. Go to the places he has marked.
 Step DescriptionYou have been to the Transparent Ruins mentioned in Soheil's old notes. Just bring what you found to him directly.
 We explored the Transparent Ruins.
Soheil: You went to the Transparent Ruins? Did you find anything?
Paimon: Of course. Be prepared to be thunderstruck!
Paimon: Aaand yup, that's another stone slate alright.
Paimon: Alright, on to the next set of Transparent Ruins!
Paimon: And that's a stone slate found! Hah, Paimon can see Soheil's eyes popping right outta his head already!
Paimon: Another set of transparent ruins, eh? Well, we know what to do to get in this time!
Paimon: Eh? It's just some stone bits... Where's the stone slate?
Paimon: Eh? Where's the stone slate? There's nothing here but some smashed stone...
Paimon: Gah! Paimon was disappointed before when we found the stone slate, but this has gotta be double the disappointment!
Paimon: Hehe, that's another slate for us. Paimon can see Soheil hopping up and down in excitement already!
Paimon: Hehe, that's our second stone slate. Paimon can see Soheil hopping up and down in excitement already!
Paimon: Hey, you look pale... Did you discover something terrible?
Paimon: Hoo, well, guess that's another stone slate after all. That was the expected result... but it was still disappointing.
Paimon: Huh. Nothing much of a discovery here... Just some stone shards.
Paimon: It's just as he described it. There's practically no difference between it and its surroundings, and it's see-through!
Paimon: Let's go back to Aaru Village and have Soheil see what the inscriptions on these slates are about.
Paimon: Looks like there isn't treasure at the end of every search, huh?

Paimon: One last set of ruins. Let's do this!
Paimon: Ooh, a stone slate, and this one's got words on it! Soheil will be so excited!
Paimon: That's the third ruin. We should find something here!
Paimon: These must be the Transparent Ruins mentioned in Soheil's old notes!
Paimon: Two more ruins. Let's do this!
Paimon: Well, that was a letdown. Hopefully we'll find something more in the next set of Transparent Ruins...
Paimon: Well, there is one last set of ruins left. Let's have a look there.

Paimon: Yay, a stone slate. That brings our total haul up to three!
Soheil: "Time Out From a Busy Schedule: On the Evolution of the Perception of Off-Days in Different Societies."
Soheil: ...
Soheil: Aha! So King Deshret did indeed withhold a secret behind that unknown force. I shall get to the bottom of it.
Soheil: Aha! So King Deshret did indeed withhold a secret behind that unknown force. I shall get to the bottom of it.
Soheil: ...
Soheil: This is...
Soheil: How could this be...?
Paimon: Hey, you look pale... Did you discover something terrible?
Soheil: Uh... No, sorry, they're not exactly "terrible"... The writings on the stone slates look complicated, but they're actually... Records of leave requests.
Soheil: In addition, the recorded excuses are not any different from that of the young scholars today...
Soheil: Phew, it's a good thing I failed to find a way to access the Transparent Ruins back in the day. I imagine that I would have been quite livid.
Soheil: Anyway, I must thank you for bringing the slates back. Perhaps I should go ask around about the excuses people make in Mondstadt. That could be enough for me to write a paper...

Soheil: You're back. Did you find anything special in the desert?
You recount your exploration of the Transparent Ruins to Soheil and give him the three stone slates.
