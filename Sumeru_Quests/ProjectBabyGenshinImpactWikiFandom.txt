(Obtain Shabby Rack)

(Obtain Strange Bead)
Paimon: What is this bead used for? Let's take it to Gulabgir.

(Obtain Strange Tiny Hats)
Paimon: Woah, here's [sic] a whole bunch of tiny hats in here. Let's take them to Gulabgir...

Gulabgir: What's the matter? Anything else on your mind?
 I found something else in the camp.
(Give Gulabgir the Strange Bead)
Gulabgir: Huh? This bead... How... Where did you find this?
Paimon: Inside a pot in the camp. Did you leave that behind?
Gulabgir: Ah, it was used in past shows. Whenever I play the flute, my little fellas would carry that bead on their heads and dance with their upper bodies in the air.
Gulabgir: But tricks of this kind have long ceased being profitable, and I haven't performed for quite some time either. I didn't even notice that it had gone missing...
Gulabgir: Anyway, thanks for bringing it back. Here's your payment, please take it.

Gulabgir: What's the matter? Anything else on your mind?
 I found something else in the camp.
(Give Gulabgir the Strange Tiny Hats)
Gulabgir: Huh? These hats... Hahaha, I made them for the snakes. How did I even forget these?
Gulabgir: I made each of them a nightcap so that they could attract children to the show.
Gulabgir: Red for Jori, green for Amum, yellow for Gana, and blue for Drak...
Paimon: Sounds cute! The show must've been a hit!
Gulabgir: It went well at first, but the children would burst into tears whenever the snakes opened their jaws...
Gulabgir: Oh, forget about it... Please take this as your payment. It's something, at least.

Gulabgir: What's the matter? Anything else on your mind?
(Traveler): I found something else in the camp.
(Give Gulabgir the Shabby Rack)
Gulabgir: Ah! Isn't this the snake climbing tower I made? Wow, this sure brings back some memories! Hahaha!
Paimon: Snake climbing tower? What even is that?
Gulabgir: Just a toy for the snakes to climb on. I can't have them hanging on me all the time, you know?
Gulabgir: Thanks for bringing it back. Please take this as your payment.
Gulabgir: So I designed it like that? Hah, this sure does bring back some memories...
 About the camp...
 Absolutely delicious!
 Changsheng would get mad at you for saying that.
 Delicious!
 Have you been away from the forest for a very long time?
 How many camps have you got, again?
Gulabgir: Well, I set up a few while I was living in the rainforest.
Gulabgir: I've already stopped living in the rainforest, but I still do rest at my campsites if I collect herbs there.
 I don't think Changsheng counts as a "pet"...
 I found something else in the camp.
 Is this what you're looking for?
(Give Gulabgir the snake food)
 Leave it to me.
Gulabgir: Thank you so much. Who knows what accidents we might run into if I were to go there with these little fellas.
Gulabgir: If they got it into their heads to go playing around in the forest for a few days, I'd be doomed...
 Quest DescriptionSnake Handler Gulabgir seems to be in trouble...
 There aren't any other snakes at the campsites, right...?
Gulabgir: No, not at all. I set all my camps up away from snake lairs precisely so that we could stay away from trouble...
 Uh huh. Very reasonable of you.
(Traveler): I found something else in the camp.
Gulabgir: (Hope the little ones aren't starving...)
Gulabgir: *sigh* But after that, they haven't been moving much, and have stubbornly refused to eat any other food.
Gulabgir: ...Sorry, I've said too much. Here is your payment. Please take it.
Gulabgir: Ah! Isn't this the snake climbing tower I made? Wow, this sure brings back some memories! Hahaha!
Gulabgir: Ah, it was used in past shows. Whenever I play the flute, my little fellas would carry that bead on their heads and dance with their upper bodies in the air.
Gulabgir: Ahem! Don't mind me. Thank you very much. Here's your payment.
Gulabgir: And there weren't that many vines around when I established that camp.
Gulabgir: Anyway, I'm counting on you, Traveler.
Gulabgir: Anyway, thanks for bringing it back. Here's your payment, please take it.
Gulabgir: But I can't really leave, what with all my little fellas to care for and stuff. I don't want them scaring anyone again when they search for food...
Gulabgir: But ever since they startled several children whilst feeding, I have banned them from going out without me. I've started making food for them.
Gulabgir: But tricks of this kind have long ceased being profitable, and I haven't performed for quite some time either. I didn't even notice that it had gone missing...
Gulabgir: Eh, you know what, forget about it... Thanks for your help. Here's your payment.
Gulabgir: Fungi, huh... Phew, guess I was lucky to have you go instead. Thank you so much, Traveler.
Gulabgir: Gone again... Um... Traveler! Could you please do me a favor?
Gulabgir: Guess I should really consider starting a feed-selling business...
Gulabgir: Hahaha, I'm really rusty when it comes to setting up camps now.
Gulabgir: Here's your meal, little fellas...
Gulabgir: How did it go? Did you find the food?
Gulabgir: Huh? These hats... Hahaha, I made them for the snakes. How did I even forget these?
Gulabgir: Huh? This bead... How... Where did you find this?
Gulabgir: I can't thank you enough. Please, accept this as your payment.
Gulabgir: I made each of them a nightcap so that they could attract children to the show.
Gulabgir: I must have left their food at one of my camps when I was out picking herbs.
Gulabgir: I see... Was it the work of wild animals...?
Gulabgir: I'll mark all the camps I've stayed at on the map for you, so please take a look at those spots.
Gulabgir: I've already stopped living in the rainforest, but I still do rest at my campsites if I collect herbs there.
Gulabgir: If that turns out well, I could be making much more money than I do now by putting up performances...
Gulabgir: If they got it into their heads to go playing around in the forest for a few days, I'd be doomed...
Gulabgir: Is this stuff so popular with animals? Maybe I should start a business...
Gulabgir: It went well at first, but the children would burst into tears whenever the snakes opened their jaws...
Gulabgir: Just a toy for the snakes to climb on. I can't have them hanging on me all the time, you know?
Gulabgir: Most of the camps I've set up in the past have been abandoned.
Gulabgir: My food is missing!
Gulabgir: My snakes were alert and would wake me every time. But I never found anything no matter how many times I checked...
Gulabgir: Nah, I'm pretty skilled when it comes to living in the wild.
Gulabgir: No, not at all. I set all my camps up away from snake lairs precisely so that we could stay away from trouble...
Gulabgir: Now that you mention it, the food I made attracted Fungi and birds... So, attracting wild animals sounds about right...
Gulabgir: Oh! When I was camping there, I could hear strange sounds at night, and I could feel something scratching at my tent...
Gulabgir: Oh, forget about it... Please take this as your payment. It's something, at least.
Gulabgir: Oh, sorry, I'm getting off-topic... Thanks for your help, and please, take your payment.
Gulabgir: Red for Jori, green for Amum, yellow for Gana, and blue for Drak...
Gulabgir: Seriously? How could there be a landslide? That spot has never been in any trouble...
Gulabgir: So I designed it like that? Hah, this sure does bring back some memories...
Gulabgir: Sort of. I can't remember the details.
Gulabgir: Thank you so much. Who knows what accidents we might run into if I were to go there with these little fellas.
Gulabgir: Thanks for bringing it back. Please take this as your payment.
Gulabgir: Traveler, would you mind visiting that campsite and fetching the food for me?
Gulabgir: Uh, no, that can't be it! My pet snakes' food â€” that's what's missing!
Gulabgir: Well, I set up a few while I was living in the rainforest.
Gulabgir: Well... Maybe the birds had them stashed away for a rainy day...
Gulabgir: What kind of life would I be leading had I remained in the rainforest...?
Gulabgir: What's the matter? Anything else on your mind?
Gulabgir: Yes! That's it! So I did leave it in the camp after all.
Gulabgir: Yes, these would do! Thank you so much.
Gulabgir: Yes, they did hunt by themselves in the past.
Gulabgir: You are back! I gotta say, that was quick. Did you find the food?
Paimon: *sigh* Paimon thought "there was no such thing as a free lunch"...
Paimon: Eh? There are some bottles and pots... Maybe Gulabgir left something else here...?
Paimon: Enjoying food is Paimon's job!
Paimon: How is the food under these stones? Was there some kinda landslide? Shall we go up and have another look around?
Paimon: Inside a pot in the camp. Did you leave that behind?
Paimon: It was buried under the rocks. Your camp seems to have gotten caught in a landslide that carried your stuff far away. We spent a long while looking, actually.
Paimon: Look at those Fungi. Why are they gathering over there? They aren't stealing the food, are they? C'mon, you've gotta shoo them away!
Paimon: Oh! This should be the snake food Gulabgir's looking for!
Paimon: Paimon doesn't see anything. Let's come closer to take a better look.
Paimon: Paimon hasn't even asked about the flavor yet, so you can dream on!
Paimon: Paimon's sure we've met someone with a snake for a pet before... Right! It's that weirdo named Baizhu...
Paimon: Snake climbing tower? What even is that?
Paimon: Sounds cute! The show must've been a hit!
Paimon: There's nothing down there. Maybe we should check out the tree...
Paimon: There's nothing here...
Paimon: There's special food for pet snakes? Don't they eat mice and stuff?
Paimon: Ugh... It's a total mess around here. Where on earth is the food...?
Paimon: What is this bead used for? Let's take it to Gulabgir.
Paimon: What's here... Ugh, just some mushrooms...
Paimon: When we arrived, there were Fungi that were trying to swipe it.
Paimon: Whoa! Look at all those thorny vines! Be careful!
Paimon: Why is your camp in the middle of a bunch of thorny vines!? Wouldn't you get hurt sleeping there?
Paimon: Why weren't these in the camp, but on the nearby tree?
Paimon: Woah, here's [sic] a whole bunch of tiny hats in here. Let's take them to Gulabgir...
