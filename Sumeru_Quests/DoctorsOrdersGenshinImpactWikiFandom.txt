(Clear all the weeds)
Paimon: Eh? What are you...? What? If we remove all the weeds, Mr. Gurgen will agree to rest?
Paimon: Ooh, yeah! That's a great idea!
(Talk to Gurgen after removing the weeds)
Gurgen: The weeds... You've removed them all? I... You're too kind!
 Just go back home and rest.
Gurgen: I will, thank you. May the Dendro Archon bless and protect you!
Gurgen: I should hurry home to conduct my silent prayers to the Dendro Archon as well.
 
(Talk to Zakariya)
Zakariya: You are back. How did it go?
 About removing the weeds...
Zakariya: Ah, that's great. This way, Gurgen can finally have some proper rest. He should be able to recover sooner.
Zakariya: I can't thank you enough. Please take this as your payment.

(Talk to Aftab)
Aftab: I just need to hold on for several days more...
(Submit Delicious Steak ×1)
Aftab: What is this? No... The scent is just too...
 So here's what happened...
Aftab: Really? A light diet doesn't mean a full ban on meat? Even the Akademiya researchers don't do that?
Aftab: S—So that's it! I was afraid of making the Dendro Archon angry by eating meat.
Aftab: If even the researchers do eat meat... I won't worry about eating meat anymore. Thank you!
 
(Talk to Zakariya)
Zakariya: You're back. How did it go?
 I told him that he could just eat a steak or two...
Zakariya: Oh? It didn't occur to me you could put it like that...
Zakariya: Well, as long as Aftab is treating his body right, everything should be fine.
Zakariya: I can't thank you enough. Please take this as your payment.

(Talk to Azra)
Azra: Ugh, this is too bitter for anyone to swallow. How am I supposed to take it all?
(Submit Sugar ×1)
Azra: Eh? Are these for me? Thank you...
Azra: Alright! I'll give the medicine another go... I'll finish it all for sure this time!
 
(Talk to Zakariya)
Zakariya: You're back. How did it go?
 I gave her some candies.
Zakariya: Candies? They'll reduce the efficacy of that medicine, though.
Zakariya: ...Ah, never mind. Reduced efficacy is better than no efficacy at all, and at least she can finish the medicine this time around.
Zakariya: I really can't thank you enough. Please take this as payment.

(Talk to Zakariya)
Zakariya: You're back. How did it go?
 He has kept away from meat for quite a few days now...
Zakariya: What? I was telling him to eat lighter, not to completely stop eating meat!
Zakariya: Does he think that he can best embrace the Dendro Archon's blessings this way?
Zakariya: Alright... I guess I have to come up with something else...
Zakariya: Thanks for your hard work. Here, this is for you.

(Talk to Zakariya)
Zakariya: You're back. How did it go?
 He wanted to deal with the weeds first...
Zakariya: *sigh* So even the silent prayer line didn't work... I suppose I'll have to come up with something else.
Zakariya: Thanks for your hard work. Please, take this as payment.

(Talk to Zakariya)
Zakariya: You're back. How did it go?
 She complained that the medicine was too bitter.
Zakariya: Well, there's nothing I can do about that. After all, the nature and components of the herbs... Ahem, I mean blessings, come with some bitterness.
Zakariya: Hopefully, she will finish it all this time. There was so much left over previously...
Zakariya: Thanks for your hard work. Please take this as payment.

Zakariya: The medicine delivery this time is for Aftab at the farmhouse.
Zakariya: That fellow's been living on a greasy diet, so he has serious digestion problems.
Zakariya: So please give him this medicine. By the way, tell him that... Um...
Zakariya: Tell him that eating lighter foods and having less alcohol and meat is the way to better embrace the blessings of the Dendro Archon.
 Sure.
 Where on earth did you hear such things?
Zakariya: Some Akademiya researchers have said that we can do something like that, though I don't understand why...
Zakariya: Please come back once the delivery is done. I will have the payment ready for you.
(Proceed to Aftab Version)

Zakariya: The medicine delivery this time is for Gurgen, who is at the medicine farm.
Zakariya: He strained his arm from doing too much work a few days before.
Zakariya: Please give him this medicine. By the way, tell him to also stay at home and pray silently to the Dendro Archon. Farm work can wait.
 Sure.
 Pray silently to the Dendro Archon?
Zakariya: He won't listen to a word I say if I don't say that. Just do as I instructed, alright?
Zakariya: Please come back once the delivery is done. I will have the payment ready for you.
(Proceed to Gurgen Version)

Zakariya: The medicine this time is for Azra at the theater entrance.
Zakariya: She has been coughing lately, but she refused to take the medicine I prescribed, saying that it tastes too bitter.
Zakariya: Please give her this medicine. Also, tell her that... Um...
Zakariya: This... bitterness in the medicine is but a... test, yes, a test, bestowed by the Dendro Archon.
 Sure I will.
 Where did you learn this stuff?
Zakariya: I didn't exactly learn it? I've just heard these kinds of things too often.
Zakariya: Please come back once the delivery is done. I will have the payment ready for you.
(Proceed to Azra Version)
 About removing the weeds...
 Aren't you a pious believer of the Dendro Archon?
Zakariya: Of course I am. Can you find someone in Sumeru City who isn't?
Zakariya: But you can leave "piousness" out of this. I would consider myself a rather... rational believer in the Dendro Archon.
 Do you need a hand with anything?
 He has kept away from meat for quite a few days now...
 He wanted to deal with the weeds first...
 Here's your medicine, remember to pray quietly to the Dendro Archon.
 Here's your medicine. Please maintain a light diet.
 Here's your medicine. Remember to finish all of it...
 I gave her some candies.
 I told him that he could just eat a steak or two...
 Just go back home and rest.
 Leave it to me.
Zakariya: I'm counting on you. For the Dendro Archon's sake, I could really use a helper capable of saying something other than saying "Dendro Archon bless you."
Zakariya: Hah, "For the Dendro Archon's sake"... I've been saying that a lot lately, haven't I?
 Pray silently to the Dendro Archon?
Zakariya: He won't listen to a word I say if I don't say that. Just do as I instructed, alright?
 Quest DescriptionZakariya of Bimarstan is taking great pains to help his patients.
 She complained that the medicine was too bitter.
 So here's what happened...
 Some say that treatment itself is the blessing of the Dendro Archon...
Zakariya: *sigh* But just consider these stories, alright? Don't be so serious about it like some of our patients.
Zakariya: If the Dendro Archon were as mighty as the legends claim, I would only need to feed people some mushrooms, and bam, they would be healed.
 Sure I will.
 Sure.
 This is but a test from the Dendro Archon, you know?
 What's happened here?
Zakariya: You must be a traveler. This is Bimarstan, a hospital that aids the masses... Um... by spreading the blessings of the Dendro Archon.
Zakariya: No matter rich or poor, anyone in need shall get medical help here.
Zakariya: But as a result... We have too many patients and not enough hands to see to them all.
Zakariya: *sigh* The benevolence of the Dendro Archon might be endless... But our budget and manpower are not.
Zakariya: And then there are patients who ignore all medical instructions, but just keep asking about how to better embrace the blessings of the Dendro Archon.
Zakariya: Haha, blessings of the Dendro Archon... My goodness!
Zakariya: If the Dendro Archon really could just rain down blessings, they wouldn't have gotten sick in the first place!
Zakariya: ...Phew, sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Please don't tell Golshan about this, or she might lecture me again.
 Aren't you a pious believer of the Dendro Archon?
Zakariya: Of course I am. Can you find someone in Sumeru City who isn't?
Zakariya: But you can leave "piousness" out of this. I would consider myself a rather... rational believer in the Dendro Archon.

Zakariya: If the Dendro Archon were as mighty as the legends claim, I would only need to feed people some mushrooms, and bam, they would be healed.
Zakariya: Ugh... Sorry, I must be too tired out. I was just venting. Please don't take what I said too seriously.
 Where did you learn this stuff?
Zakariya: I didn't exactly learn it? I've just heard these kinds of things too often.
 Where on earth did you hear such things?
Zakariya: Some Akademiya researchers have said that we can do something like that, though I don't understand why...
 You should take a break.
Zakariya: I'm afraid I simply cannot. I have placed patients with more serious conditions elsewhere, and I have to prepare medicines for them.
Zakariya: *sigh* They will definitely ask me how they might embrace the blessings of the Dendro Archon.
Zakariya: I am counting on you. I could really use an assistant capable of something other than talking about the blessings of the Dendro Archon...
Aftab: *sigh* Okay, I will. Honestly, I haven't touched a slice of meat in days. I'm sure that this will definitely help me to embrace the Dendro Archon's blessings better...
Aftab: ...
Aftab: But why do I feel worse than before? *sigh* No, no, I must've just spent too little time dieting, that's all...
Aftab: Hmm? What is this medicine?
Aftab: I just need to hold on for a few days more...
(Submit Prescription Medication from Bimarstan for Aftab)
Aftab: I just need to hold on for several days more...
Aftab: If even the researchers do eat meat... I won't worry about eating meat anymore. Thank you!
Aftab: Really? A light diet doesn't mean a full ban on meat? Even the Akademiya researchers don't do that?
Aftab: S—So that's it! I was afraid of making the Dendro Archon angry by eating meat.
Aftab: What is this? No... The scent is just too...
Azra: *sigh* Day after day I guard this door. When will I get to take a look inside?
(Submit Prescription Medication from Bimarstan for Azra)
Azra: ...Alright, alright, hand me the medicine. I'll take it later...
Azra: Alright! I'll give the medicine another go... I'll finish it all for sure this time!
Azra: Eh? Are these for me? Thank you...
Azra: Eh? Is that so? But it's so bitter... Can't the Dendro Archon be just a wee bit nicer?
Azra: Hmm... This smells familiar...
Azra: Ugh, this again... I can't take it. It's just way too bitter.
Azra: Ugh, this is too bitter for anyone to swallow. How am I supposed to take it all?
Gurgen: *sigh* I guess my body isn't what it used to be... No, I can't give up yet. I must persist for a while more.
Gurgen: Ah, thanks. Pray quietly to the Dendro Archon... Yes, I must do that...
Gurgen: But there are so many weeds in the field... If I keep doing nothing, it's going to affect the yield.
Gurgen: Huh? This is...
Gurgen: I should hurry home to conduct my silent prayers to the Dendro Archon as well.
Gurgen: I will, thank you. May the Dendro Archon bless and protect you!
Gurgen: If I stop tending to the field for too many days, the weeds are going to grow...
(Submit Prescription Medication from Bimarstan for Gurgen)
Gurgen: The weeds... You've removed them all? I... You're too kind!
Gurgen: Um... I'll just deal with the weeds first, then do my silent prayers when I finish.
Paimon: Eh? What are you...? What? If we remove all the weeds, Mr. Gurgen will agree to rest?
Paimon: Ooh, yeah! That's a great idea!
Zakariya: (Can't they just do as the doctor told them?)
Zakariya: *sigh* But just consider these stories, alright? Don't be so serious about it like some of our patients.
Zakariya: *sigh* So even the silent prayer line didn't work... I suppose I'll have to come up with something else.
Zakariya: *sigh* The benevolence of the Dendro Archon might be endless... But our budget and manpower are not.
Zakariya: *sigh* They will definitely ask me how they might embrace the blessings of the Dendro Archon.
Zakariya: *sigh* What a headache...
Zakariya: ...Ah, never mind. Reduced efficacy is better than no efficacy at all, and at least she can finish the medicine this time around.
Zakariya: ...Phew, sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Please don't tell Golshan about this, or she might lecture me again.

Zakariya: I'm counting on you. For the Dendro Archon's sake, I could really use a helper capable of saying something other than saying "Dendro Archon bless you."
Zakariya: If the Dendro Archon really could just rain down blessings, they wouldn't have gotten sick in the first place!
Zakariya: If the Dendro Archon were as mighty as the legends claim, I would only need to feed people some mushrooms, and bam, they would be healed.
Zakariya: If you would, Traveler, could you help me deliver some medicine to the patients nearby? Please check on them as well.
Zakariya: No matter rich or poor, anyone in need shall get medical help here.
Zakariya: Of course I am. Can you find someone in Sumeru City who isn't?
