(As Eide and the Traveler approach the opening door, an Abyss Herald comes out)
 ...Eide?
 ...Huh?
 Are you alright now?
 But Eide... that was not a god.
 But if you insist...
 Don't we still need to go to the Statue of the Seven?
 Eide, this place is bad news. We've got to go!
 Eide?
 Fine, go ahead.
 I can't believe it...
 I just have lots of combat experience.
 I'm stunned.
 I've seen similar characters before.
 It's unbelievable.
 Let's go have a look.
 Look...
 No idea.
 No, it's not.
 Quest DescriptionThe medicine meant to restore Caribert didn't work quite as expected. During the process of remaking the medicine, you seem to find yourself beset upon by strange phenomena...
 Something's not right about this place. We need to get out of here.
 Still, this hilichurl...
 Terrifying?
 That sounds like a ridiculous idea...
 That was... a "Sinner."
 There's no silk scarf around his arm.
 There's something strange about it.
 What are those hilichurls doing?
 What is that thing!?
 Why are we back here?
 Yeah...
 You have unconventional tastes.
 You...
(Eide and the Traveler talk outside the house)
(Traveler): (...Who in the world are you? What do these words mean?)
(Traveler): (A "Sinner"...?)
(Traveler): (An Abyss Herald? No, he doesn't look like someone from the Abyss Order...)
(Traveler): (Eide's experience has deeply affected him... Not that he was particularly stable to begin with, but this... religious fervor is something else...)
(Traveler): (I guess I'd better catch up with him anyway. There are monsters everywhere... I can't stand by and let him fall into their hands.)
(Eide begins to leave and the Traveler runs behind him to catch up)
(Traveler): (So it does have something to do with the Abyss Order. And these worshiping hilichurls remind me a little too much of the Grand Thief...)
(Traveler): (The air here, and this creepy scene... it's eerily familiar...)
(Traveler): (The voice... it's gone...)
(The crystal glows and wisps of purple energy fly into Eide's body)
(Traveler): (Whose voice is that? It must be coming from right inside my head... Can't Eide hear it?)
(Traveler): (Wrapped in chains, hanging in midair, emanating a sinister aura... There's no mistaking it. It's just like the Defiled Statue!)
Another dose of medicine is administered to the hilichurl...
Father and son talk for a long while. Eide seems like a changed man after his religious experience...
Media:vo dialog szaq203 caribert 01.ogg Caribert: Do you live in the fairytale world as well? My name's Caribert, nice to meet you...
Media:vo szaq203 1 eide 01.ogg Eide: That's... that's not Caribert.
Media:vo szaq203 1 eide 02.ogg Eide: Right. Caribert's scarf was a gift I once gave to his mother. I use it now as a marker of sorts.
Media:vo szaq203 1 eide 03.ogg Eide: M—My eyes must be going... how could I not recognize my own son? Ugh, this decrepit body of mine... *sigh*
Media:vo szaq203 1 eide 04.ogg Eide: Yes... It doesn't seem interested in us in the least. It seems intent on walking in that direction... Where could it be going?
Media:vo szaq203 1 eide 05.ogg Eide: Yes... The more we know about hilichurls, the better.
Media:vo szaq203 10 caribert 01.ogg Caribert: ...
(Caribert opens his eyes to see Eide)
Media:vo szaq203 10 caribert 02.ogg Caribert: ...P—Papa...?
Media:vo szaq203 10 caribert 03.ogg Caribert: Where's... Mama?
Media:vo szaq203 10 caribert 04.ogg Caribert: Of course... You're Papa.
Media:vo szaq203 10 caribert 05.ogg Caribert: Yes... it feels like I just woke up from a long, long sleep. I dreamed that I was hiding in a little room. I didn't dare go out the whole time, and I didn't want to either...
(Caribert looks down and sees his hands and feet)
Media:vo szaq203 10 caribert 06.ogg Caribert: Wait...
Media:vo szaq203 10 caribert 07.ogg Caribert: My body! What happened to me? Is this... is this me?
Media:vo szaq203 10 caribert 08.ogg Caribert: Papa... What's happened to me!?
Media:vo szaq203 10 caribert 09.ogg Caribert: Am I... dead?
Media:vo szaq203 10 caribert 10.ogg Caribert: Really...?
Media:vo szaq203 10 caribert 11.ogg Caribert: Okay, Papa... I won't, I promise...
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 01.ogg Eide: Caribert! Oh, thank goodness. He's still okay.
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 02.ogg Eide: I... I have a strange feeling that what just happened was meant to be.
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 03.ogg Eide: For this to happen right at the moment when I was dreading worshiping at a Statue of the Seven... it's as if fate was calling to me.
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 04.ogg Eide: You say that I bowed before that thing, so perhaps... it might be just as effective?
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 05.ogg Eide: I have to try. No matter what. ...You said it yourself: I have to exhaust all options.
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 06.ogg Eide: Caribert...?
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 07.ogg Eide: *gasp* ...Caribert! Oh, my goodness, it worked! It's a miracle!!! Oh, Caribert, my dear son...
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 08.ogg Eide: You see!? It worked! Caribert can speak again!
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 09.ogg Eide: Mama is... Caribert, look at me. Do you know who I am?
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 10.ogg Eide: Haha... Yes! Hahahaha... Salvation, sweet salvation... Yes, this is what this feeling is...
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 11.ogg Eide: How do you feel, Caribert? Are you fully awake now?
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 12.ogg Eide: ...
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 13.ogg Eide: ...Don't panic, son. It's just... while you were sleeping, we went into a fairytale world.
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 14.ogg Eide: There's no more Khaenri'ah here, no more home — but do you know what that means? No more red sky... no more end of the world.
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 15.ogg Eide: In this world, you have to be a little monster... but you get to stay with Papa forever.
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 16.ogg Eide: No, no, of course not! Look, Caribert... you still have Mama's scarf on your arm. That means she's watching over you, protecting you. So how could you be dead?
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 17.ogg Eide: Yes, really! You've only just woken up, and this must all be very confusing for you. Just rest here for now... Things will get better.
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 18.ogg Eide: Oh, and um... you have to promise me something...
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 19.ogg Eide: Never take off your mask.
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 20.ogg Eide: Understand? Whatever happens, you mustn't take it off...
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 21.ogg Eide: Not since that day have I been so glad as I am now... I can't believe this is really happening...
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 22.ogg Eide: Hmph, I knew that placing my hope in The Seven was a waste of time... I even worshiped at one of their statues like a common fool. Never before have I humiliated myself like that...
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 23.ogg Eide: Once a murderer, always a murderer... I was naive to think that the gods who conspired against us would ever offer redemption.
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 24.ogg Eide: But the god we saw in that cave... Now that was a truly mighty god! Nothing like one of The Seven!
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 25.ogg Eide: That wondrous power... It was truly enchanting... Surely, that must have been the reason I bowed down?
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 26.ogg Eide: Hmm, now then... after one beseeches a god, and the god responds by answering their prayers, should they, um... do something to show their devotion?
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 27.ogg Eide: Piety is hardly my area of expertise... but surely I should honor the god that has honored my wishes.
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 28.ogg Eide: A "Sinner"? Don't be absurd. You don't know a single thing about him... how dare you utter such blasphemy?
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 29.ogg Eide: You and I have both witnessed his divine power. When have The Seven worked a miracle like this before? Never... He is a god mightier than they! And yet you would call him a "Sinner"? Preposterous!
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 30.ogg Eide: No matter... Believe what you will. You cannot shake my faith.
Media:vo szaq203 10 eide 31.ogg Eide: I am going to pay my respects — with or without you.
Media:vo szaq203 2 eide 01.ogg Eide: Did it go in here? Hmm... Well, let's head in.
Media:vo szaq203 3 eide 01.ogg Eide: What a ghastly place... Has it always existed? I swear I've never noticed it before...
Media:vo szaq203 3 eide 02.ogg Eide: Huh. It looks like they're... worshiping. Sometimes walking, sometimes kneeling in worship... And it appears to be in earnest.
Media:vo szaq203 3 eide 03.ogg Eide: I've never seen anything like this in all my life. What in the world does this place conceal?
Media:vo szaq203 3 eide 04.ogg Eide: Oh, there's only one way to find out.
Media:vo szaq203 4 fortunelector 01.ogg ???: Halt, humans. Fate has not granted you the right to enter this place...
Media:vo szaq203 4 fortunelector 02.ogg ???: Hmm, do you insist on an audience?
Media:vo szaq203 4 fortunelector 03.ogg ???: ...Very well, then I grant you the trial of destiny.
Media:vo szaq203 5 eide 01.ogg Eide: Who was that? He was... he was...
Media:vo szaq203 5 eide 02.ogg Eide: ...He was a perfect being. I'm in awe.
Media:vo szaq203 5 eide 03.ogg Eide: He had the most wondrous aura, a perilous yet beautiful power... Truly mesmerizing.
Media:vo szaq203 5 eide 04.ogg Eide: And yet you were able to defeat him. Your strength is greater than I had imagined. Hehe...
Media:vo szaq203 5 eide 05.ogg Eide: Let's continue on. I find myself growing more curious by the second... and more excited.
Media:vo szaq203 6 hero 01.ogg Media:vo szaq203 6 heroine 01.ogg (Traveler): Is this a teleportation device? What energy is powering it...
Media:vo szaq203 7 hero 01.ogg Media:vo szaq203 7 heroine 01.ogg (Traveler): It seems like I need to find a place to insert the rune.
Media:vo szaq203 8 hero 01.ogg Media:vo szaq203 8 heroine 01.ogg (Traveler): How did I get on the ceiling? Did the room turn upside down, or gravity itself...?
Media:vo szaq203 9 eide 01.ogg Eide: I think... we've made it to the end...
Media:vo szaq203 9 eide 02.ogg Eide: ...
Media:vo szaq203 9 eide 03.ogg Eide: *pant* *pant* ...What just happened?
Media:vo szaq203 9 eide 04.ogg Eide: When I saw that thing, my heart was instantly at peace... I—I was overcome by a sense of awe... or joy, perhaps.
Media:vo szaq203 9 eide 05.ogg Eide: I am... I feel good, in fact... I—I feel better than I did before I came in here. How peculiar...
Media:vo szaq203 9 eide 06.ogg Eide: Oh, i—is that so? Alright, as you wish.
Media:vo szaq203 9 hero 01.ogg Media:vo szaq203 9 heroine 01.ogg (Traveler): !!!
Media:vo szaq203 9 schickzal 01.ogg Voice Inside the Head: ...O, dear creature, why do you bow down? For fear of the unknown? Or for a power that you covet?
Media:vo szaq203 9 schickzal 02.ogg Voice Inside the Head: ...O, dear creature, why do you bow down? For I am no god... I am but a "Sinner."
Media:vo szaq203 9 schickzal 03.ogg Voice Inside the Head: You are like a flower born in sin yet pure, spotless... I know your fate well.
Media:vo szaq203 9 schickzal 04.ogg Voice Inside the Head: You need no longer hold back your resentment, nor accept the countless lies.
Media:vo szaq203 9 schickzal 05.ogg Voice Inside the Head: Go forth, become a transcendent one, rise beyond the fate bestowed upon you...
Media:vo szaq203 9 schickzal 06.ogg Voice Inside the Head: And I shall shed a tear at the end of time... as I gaze back upon your life.
Voice Inside the Head: ...
You leave the ominous cave and return to Eide's house.
