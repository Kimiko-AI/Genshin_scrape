 ...That's everything we've experienced so far in Sumeru.
 But now I know we're all in this together.
 But the sages' end product won't be Greater Lord Rukkhadevata...
 I want to share everything I know with all of you.
 I will do my utmost.
 Is everyone okay!?
 It looks like a tomb.
 It will be The Balladeer.
 May I ask them a question?
 Mmph...
 Is everyone okay!?
(The Traveler looks around to find that they have fallen into a large pit)
 No doubt.
 You finally believe me.
 No matter what lies ahead...
 Quest DescriptionAs agreed, you go to the place designated by Rahman to exchange hostages...
 Step DescriptionAfter the deal was struck, Rahman agreed to return all the scholars who were taken away. You will go to his stronghold to receive these people...
 The sages are trying to create a new god, aren't they?
 This is a turn for the better.
 Yes, I'm sorry. I had my reasons...
 You didn't have to admit to that.
 You finally believe me.
(Traveler): (...)
(Traveler): (...I never imagined a god could be subjected to such cruelty.)
(Traveler): (Despite everything Lesser Lord Kusanali has done for her people, the Akademiya has abandoned her in the Sanctuary of Surasthana like a lost cause...)
(Traveler): (Even now, they still refuse to acknowledge Lesser Lord Kusanali...)
(Traveler): (Even those she's protected have never realized there's such a small and childlike god in the world.)
(Traveler): (Greater Lord Rukkhadevata came to the rescue of King Deshret and his people, but eradicating the forbidden knowledge took so much of her power...)
(Traveler): (It's hard to not feel weighed down by what we just learned.)
(Traveler): (The two deities' followers have resented each other all this time, completely unaware that their gods stuck by each other through life and death.)
...After that, the whole story comes out.All the experiences, feelings, and secrets are shared freely with everyone.To share everything means to consider everyone as allies. From today on, everyone will fight for the same goal.
Alhaitham also turns towards the crowd. He wants to listen, too.
Ceremonial Guide: Look up at the hall as a mortal and listen to King Deshret's holy guidance.
Cutscene's Travel Log summary:
Enraged by Rahman's quibbling, Dehya begins to fight with the man and his gang. But it is at this dire moment that something unexpected happens â€” the ground shakes and the sand sinks, and just when this sudden earthquake is about to engulf all of you, a prodigious surge of energy suddenly comes from the unconscious scholar, who then charges forth swiftly to embrace Isak. Green light radiates from the old researcher, forming a large shield that covers you all as you slowly sink underground...
(Rahman's gang members hold Isak's "Grandpa" hostage)
Rahman Gang Member A: Hey
Rahman Gang Member A: Flame-Mane!
Rahman Gang Member A: What do you think you're doing?
Isak ...Grandpa!
Rahman Gang Member A: Don't you see this blade here...?
Rahman Gang Member B: You coward!
Rahman Gang Member B: Why are your hands shaking!?
(The sand starts to sink)
Rahman Gang Member A: Wait a second...
Rahman Gang Member A: It's an...
Rahman Gang Member A: Earthquake!
Isak: Grandpa!
(Isak's "Grandpa" summons forth a large spherical shield around everyone as they sink into the ground)
Isak: Grandpa...

Cutscene's Travel Log summary:
The record left by the owner of these remains reveals something of the bygone ages to you:
Kasala: Civilization is born of knowledge
Kasala: But so, too, can knowledge be its demise
Kasala: A disaster caught us unaware
Kasala: It was knowledge that did not belong to this world
Kasala: The Scarlet King (King Deshret) brought this forbidden knowledge into our world
Kasala: And it quickly spread like a plague
Kasala: People's minds were filled with crazed whispers
Kasala: Dark gray scales spread across their bodies
Kasala: Even the land was stripped of its vigor
Kasala: Only a desperate, deathly silence remained
Kasala: Were it not for Greater Lord Rukkhadevata from the forests
Kasala: The damage would have been irreversible
Kasala: She summoned the priests to build temples
Kasala: And infused into them the divine power of life
Kasala: The disaster was miraculously tempered
Kasala: And the embers of our civilization were preserved in Aaru Village
Kasala: Alas, the miracle could not last
Kasala: As long as forbidden knowledge continued to exist
Kasala: It would forever blight this world
Kasala: In the end
Kasala: The proud king of the desert... my eternal lord...
Kasala: Chose to sacrifice himself
Kasala: I have spent my whole life since guarding one of these many temples
Kasala: But now, my duty is coming to an end
Kasala: As I close my eyes for the final time
Kasala: The sight of that noble deity will appear in my vision once more...
Kasala: In helping the Scarlet King (King Deshret) to eradicate forbidden knowledge
Kasala: She exhausted her strength, and her form became that of a small child
Kasala: How strange
Kasala: Now that I think of her, I no longer have any fear of death...
Kasala: For I sense that
Kasala: The spirit of life will abide with me during my eternal sleep
Kasala: Children of the desert
Kasala: Cling no longer to past grievances
Kasala: But hold tight to the memory
Kasala: Of this act of benevolence
(Cinematic ends)
Cyno has a firm and solemn expression on his face. It looks like he's made up his mind about something.The core of his beliefs, his motivation to pursue the right course of action... everything is now clear to him.
Dehya's expression is relaxed, as if her mood hasn't been affected by the heavy conversation at all.
In between the conversations, Candace and Paimon bring over snacks and tea.
Isak ...Grandpa!
Isak: Grandpa!
Isak: Grandpa...

Media:vo dialog xmaq107 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: Don't rush. This is a big undertaking, and the planning and preparation for what lies ahead will no doubt take some time.
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: Take it slowly. We need to make sure the plan is as effective as possible.
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: Would you like me to lend you something to read?
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: I was joking. I know my books are far too difficult for you, and I have no intention of lending them out.
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 candace 01.ogg Candace: You must let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 candace 02.ogg Candace: Though I cannot leave Aaru Village, I can't help but feel... stirred when I see the looks in your eyes.
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 candace 03.ogg Candace: I've never felt as roused as this when fighting alone in the past...
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 candace 04.ogg Candace: I suppose this must be the power of camaraderie.
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: ...In the past, I never imagined that even the gods could suffer from hardship.
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: If we can find a way to change all of this... will this nation become a better place?
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: The past few days have been some of the most challenging work I've ever taken on.
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: And none of it will earn me a single Mora... I can't believe it...
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Hmm, you've got a point. Hey, what would you do if you woke up tomorrow with more money than you could ever spend?
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: That's it?
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: Hahaha, how adorable.
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: Well, here's to all our indulgent fantasies... If there's a chance they can come true, I'll give it my best shot.
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: And here's hoping that everything we do from now on will change this world for the better.
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: He's starting to read his book again! Hey! Are you even listening?
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: No way! Your books aren't quite to Paimon's taste...
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ugh! You're so annoying...
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Look on the bright side, Dehya! Maybe we'll get a huuuge reward after this is all over!
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Paimon would buy boatloads of tasty snacks!
Media:vo dialog xmaq107 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Um... and maybe some tasty drinks as well?
Media:vo xmaq106 1 candace 01.ogg Candace: Dehya, wait.
Media:vo xmaq106 1 candace 02.ogg Candace: I heard that you were quite reckless yesterday... No more of that today, understood? Or I'll be very upset with you.
Media:vo xmaq106 1 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Looks like we have everyone here. ...Isak, are you sure you want to come with us?
Media:vo xmaq106 1 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Okay. Let's go then.
Media:vo xmaq106 1 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: What's the matter?
Media:vo xmaq106 1 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: *sigh* Fine.
Media:vo xmaq106 1 isak 01.ogg Isak: I'll watch from a safe distance. Dehya... I wanna be there to bring Grandpa home.
Media:vo xmaq106 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: You're all here so early!
Media:vo xmaq106 2 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: Heh, they got here before us.
Media:vo xmaq106 2 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: Absolutely. Although...
Media:vo xmaq106 2 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: ...You brought fewer people than I imagined.
Media:vo xmaq106 2 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: ...
Media:vo xmaq106 2 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Rahman, I've always thought of you as a man of his word. What's this about?
Media:vo xmaq106 2 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: ...Uh-uh, you stay right there!
Media:vo xmaq106 2 isak 01.ogg Isak: Grandpa!
Media:vo xmaq106 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh, is it because Paimon overslept by five minutes and held everyone up?
Media:vo xmaq106 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Why is there only one of them?
Media:vo xmaq106 2 rahman 01.ogg Rahman: Is everything ready?
Media:vo xmaq106 2 rahman 02.ogg Rahman: Bring him over.
Media:vo xmaq106 2 rahman 03.ogg Rahman: It's a one-for-one exchange. Sounds fair, don't ya think?
Media:vo xmaq106 2 rahman 04.ogg Rahman: Or lemme put it this way... Agreeing to any kind of deal with the Dendro Archon's people is already a huge compromise on my part. Don't you think you've asked enough?
Media:vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: Hmph, what a nuisance.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: Hey, look around you.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: It seems that when the sand dune collapsed, it exposed these underground structures.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: The symbols on the gate belong to King Deshret's civilization. This structure must be ancient... Over time, the sandstorms completely buried it, and left it in the state we see now.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: ...It could have been an underground palace in the distant past.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: As it happens, I want to take a look inside, too.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: Don't you think it's curious? One minute, Lesser Lord Kusanali's power protects us from harm, and the next... remnants of King Deshret's civilization appear.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: Two major deities are vying to showcase their power to us. It would be a shame not to witness them both.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: Indeed. In my view, gods are just a higher form of living being... or "creature," you could say.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 10.ogg Alhaitham: New discoveries are always worth investigating. Whether they have anything to do with gods is neither here nor there.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: The sand dune collapsed.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: I saw an energy field... The Village Keeper protected us.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: It glowed green with Dendro. Just like you said, it may well have been the remains of Lesser Lord Kusanali's power inside the scholar's body.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: ...The Dendro Archon... The present one.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Mind your head.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Ugh, this day's going just great...
Media:vo xmaq106 3 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Did there use to be a... temple here?
Media:vo xmaq106 3 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: They must have fallen down here with us. Pretty lucky if you ask me.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: Most of them seem in really bad shape, except for him. He got off lightly.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: Rahman, what are you gonna do about your men?
Media:vo xmaq106 3 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: There's so much vegetation here. It's different than what I expected.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 isak 01.ogg Isak: Grandpa? Grandpa? Oh no, he's getting confused again...
Media:vo xmaq106 3 memberb 01.ogg Eremite Mercenary: Ugh... Oh...
Media:vo xmaq106 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uhh... Paimon's dizzy...
Media:vo xmaq106 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What's he doing here!? And his men, too?
Media:vo xmaq106 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: He's not actually gonna go in there, is he...
Media:vo xmaq106 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: What are you doing!?
Media:vo xmaq106 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Paimon thought you weren't interested in gods!
Media:vo xmaq106 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Sure are a lot of plants for a desert!
Media:vo xmaq106 3 rahman 01.ogg Rahman: Ohhh... A miracle! Praise King Deshret!
Media:vo xmaq106 3 rahman 02.ogg Rahman: ...Hmph.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 rahman 03.ogg Rahman: No no, this isn't the time for conflict... Our exalted lord has shown us the way to his sacred palace.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 rahman 04.ogg Rahman: I'll just let them lay here â€” King Deshret will take care of his people... Right now, I'm going inside.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 rahman 05.ogg Rahman: Now that's a sight to see... King Deshret's splendor surrounds us.
Media:vo xmaq106 3 rahman 06.ogg Rahman: Heheh, that's what I call divine providence of King Deshret.
Media:vo xmaq106 4 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: Sir Rahman.
Media:vo xmaq106 4 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: Do you see another Rahman here?
Media:vo xmaq106 4 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: Interpret it however you want, but there's something I'd like to draw your attention to. While this structure is clearly left over from King Deshret's civilization, the energy that flows in here is that of the Dendro Archon.
Media:vo xmaq106 4 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: There's nothing to be angry about. Think of this as an academic journey.
Media:vo xmaq106 4 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: It's full of life here.
Media:vo xmaq106 4 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: This defies comprehension... It looked completely desolate from the outside, yet it flows with energy inside.
Media:vo xmaq106 4 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: It does seem kinda strange. If that's true, then... we might have to explore this whole area to find an explanation.
Media:vo xmaq106 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yeah, and there's so many plants. It's so pretty.
Media:vo xmaq106 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's getting brighter! Ooh, it looks so beautiful!
Media:vo xmaq106 4 rahman 01.ogg Rahman: ...Huh? Me?
Media:vo xmaq106 4 rahman 02.ogg Rahman: Are you mocking me? What do you mean, "Sir"?
Media:vo xmaq106 4 rahman 03.ogg Rahman: ...
Media:vo xmaq106 4 rahman 04.ogg Rahman: Whatever you say. It's not like I have a Vision.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: They left something behind... Yes, it's an elegy written in an ancient script.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: "Here lies our faithful priest, Kasala."
Media:vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: "His wisdom is a miracle among the people, deserving of high praise and admiration."
Media:vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: Of course. Every student needs to master at least 20 languages before they graduate.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: Hm...
Media:vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: Is this it?
Media:vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: ...
Media:vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: There seems to be a hidden message among these skeletal remains.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: Excellent. There's a device from King Deshret's civilization in this gravesite. I'll transmit the information over and project it for everyone to see.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 10.ogg Alhaitham: Yes. However, under the circumstances, I'd prefer you to see this for yourself.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 11.ogg Alhaitham: You'll understand after watching it.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 12.ogg Alhaitham: The priest's memories.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 13.ogg Alhaitham: You might be distrustful of the Akasha, but there's no reason for you to doubt King Deshret's technology.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 14.ogg Alhaitham: You've just witnessed his priest's last words.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 15.ogg Alhaitham: The outcome, at least, is favorable.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Wait.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: What's that?
Media:vo xmaq106 5 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: There's still something off about this place... The elemental energy here is too concentrated.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: The scent of life... Is it trying to tell us something?
Media:vo xmaq106 5 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Greater Lord Rukkhadevata... So the former Dendro Archon and King Deshret were never enemies at all...
Media:vo xmaq106 5 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: You were blinded by your prejudice.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: You seem to finally understand that our true enemy is the sages.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo xmaq106 5 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: ...Stop yelling.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: What does it say?
Media:vo xmaq106 5 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: What was that...?
Media:vo xmaq106 5 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Rahman... That's enough.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: Give it a rest. You're starting to make a fool of yourself.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: Hey, how're you doing?
Media:vo xmaq106 5 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: What's your next move gonna be?
Media:vo xmaq106 5 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: It's not gonna be easy.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: When would be a good time for us to go?
Media:vo xmaq106 5 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: *sigh* Rahman's no fool. Being the leader of your own faction in the desert is no easy feat.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: It's too bad he was held back by his belief in King Deshret, but now that that's changed, I guess we have a few more people on our side.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: A load of flowers... And it looks like there's something among them...
Media:vo xmaq106 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: He's not serious, right?
Media:vo xmaq106 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Was that the former Dendro Archon? She became so tiny in the end...
Media:vo xmaq106 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: That must've been rough, but he seems to have figured things out now.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: We should get going too. Let's head back, have a proper meal, and a nice, long sleep! We'll need all our energy tomorrow.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Cynooooo! We're leaving!
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 01.ogg Rahman: These are King Deshret runes...
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 02.ogg Rahman: You can read ancient King Deshret script?
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 03.ogg Rahman: Isn't sharing knowledge against the Akademiya's rules?
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 04.ogg Rahman: No... no! Impossible!
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 05.ogg Rahman: But... this doesn't make any sense! The Dendro Archon's followers... they're clearly...
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 06.ogg Rahman: I've... never heard about any of this before...
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 07.ogg Rahman: The surviving followers of King Deshret all gathered in Aaru Village. Our god did not make mistakes... We refused to believe any of the rumors.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 08.ogg Rahman: King Deshret's death, the all-but-total annihilation of our civilization... It was all Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's doing!
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 09.ogg Rahman: We saw her as nothing more than a traitor, who stabbed us in the back in our moment of crisis... Just like us humans, fighting, feuding, double-crossing each other to survive in the desert.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 10.ogg Rahman: Hah... haha... If I hadn't seen this for myself... If I hadn't witnessed his last words with my own eyes, ears, and heart...
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 11.ogg Rahman: How could I ever begin to accept this? The truth is so far from what I've always known. Am I really supposed to believe that after all these years... All this time seeking revenge... Suddenly now my enemy is my savior!?
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 12.ogg Rahman: ...Dehya, tell me...
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 13.ogg Rahman: My Eremites and I... What are we even fighting for?
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 14.ogg Rahman: ...I'll live, heh. Thanks.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 15.ogg Rahman: I should probably go. I can't just stay here forever.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 16.ogg Rahman: I know what you're going to ask... I feel deeply ashamed of everything I've done. You'll get everything you're asking for.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 17.ogg Rahman: But please, give me some time. After everything that's happened here today... Somehow, I need to explain it to the others.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 18.ogg Rahman: Well, I guess that's for me to deal with. Dehya, this is where our camp's located. Make a note of it.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 19.ogg Rahman: Tomorrow. I'll convince everyone that we're all on the same side.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 20.ogg Rahman: And I'll return every last one of your madâ€” Sorry, your Village Keepers. We'll share our other resources with you, too.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 rahman 21.ogg Rahman: Yes. The gods never gave up on anyone. It's the people responsible for all this that need to face the consequences of their actions.
Media:vo xmaq106 5 system 01.ogg System Sound: Analyzing...
Media:vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: So these are the people who kidnapped the Village Keepers.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: There's no need to yell. No one can help you now.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: So... Your superiors have kept you quite busy recently. Why? What are they trying to accomplish?
Media:vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: Don't play dumb. You know what I'm really asking.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: They extract Divine Canned Knowledge... then what?
Media:vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: Huh?
Media:vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: ...This is what the arrogant ignorance at the extreme end of academia looks like.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: But how do you determine whether the knowledge extracted is of divine origin?
Media:vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: ...
Media:vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 10.ogg Alhaitham: You must have noticed by now â€” the Akademiya doesn't care about who their god is. It's the ability to exercise control over knowledge and wisdom that matters.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 11.ogg Alhaitham: It is as if they are cursed with a desire for omniscience and omnipotence that burns in their blood.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 12.ogg Alhaitham: Some organisms demonstrate phototaxis, and thus orient their entire lives in respect to sources of light. For the sages, their only source of hope is the existence of a deity who embodies the acme of wisdom.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 13.ogg Alhaitham: This is but a form of phototaxis. For many scholars, the absence of a God of Wisdom means stumbling in the darkness for the duration of their lives.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Where are the perpetrators?
Media:vo xmaq106 6 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: That's right.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: You should've known that I would be coming for you.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: I could do worse.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Start talking. Otherwise, I'll have to resort to... other methods.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: Be my guest.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 cyno 07.ogg Cyno:Â !
Media:vo xmaq106 6 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: ...Continue.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 cyno 09a 1.ogg Cyno: Then what does Lesser Lord Kusanali mean to you?
Media:vo xmaq106 6 cyno 09b 1.ogg Cyno: Is she not a true god present in this world? If you already have a new god, why try to create another one?
Media:vo xmaq106 6 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: So... this is the path the sages have chosen?
Media:vo xmaq106 6 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Rahman, we're here.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: I guess all I can say now is... thanks for agreeing to help.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: You don't wanna make things any more difficult for yourself, do ya?
Media:vo xmaq106 6 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: Huh? That sure didn't sound like a fancy metaphor or anything... You're serious, aren't you?
Media:vo xmaq106 6 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: ...It adds up.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: Alright, let's try to keep our cool. If everyone's in a bad mood, then let's change up our scenery.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: Rahman, give me a few men to help us escort the Village Keepers back to the village. And these two scholars â€” they're coming too.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 judar 01.ogg Judar: No, not Cyno... He's gonna tear us limb from limb!
Media:vo xmaq106 6 judar 02.ogg Judar: Um... they, um, wanted to extract Canned Knowledge...
Media:vo xmaq106 6 judar 03.ogg Judar: There's no use hiding it now... Yes, you're right.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 judar 04.ogg Judar: The Akademiya is working on an important and potentially world-changing project. They are creating a new god... a god that will belong to them, and to the people of Sumeru.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 judar 05.ogg Judar: It may seem as if Sumeru's academics are thriving, but ever since the death of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, scholarly breakthroughs have been few and far between.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 judar 06.ogg Judar: The withering of Irminsul has been getting worse recently. The sages have tried everything they could think of, but nothing's worked. I'm always hearing them say things like, "If only Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was still with us..."
Media:vo xmaq106 6 judar 07.ogg Judar: And then, someone from the Fatui showed up. They called him "The Doctor"... He brought a... a "Gnosis," and said he wanted to borrow the Akademiya's research facilities.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 judar 08.ogg Judar: The Doctor was previously expelled from the Akademiya. At first, the sages looked down at him in disdain... But when he said those words, everyone's expression changed.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 judar 09.ogg Judar: He asked them: "Do you wish to create a god?"
Media:vo xmaq106 6 judar 10.ogg Judar: First, the Akademiya spent a long time constructing a "divine vessel," which was based on an exquisite humanoid puppet.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 judar 11.ogg Judar: After that, they harvested dreams via the Sabzeruz Festival samsara, maximizing the Akasha's output...
Media:vo xmaq106 6 judar 12.ogg Judar: With The Doctor's help, and the Akasha now functioning at maximum efficiency, they were able to use it to extract the power from the Gnosis and convert it into a "divine core."
Media:vo xmaq106 6 judar 13.ogg Judar: Next, they decided that their new god needed to possess "divine wisdom." For that to happen... they needed a huge quantity of Divine Canned Knowledge.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 morghi 01.ogg Morghi: Oh no, it's the scribe!?
Media:vo xmaq106 6 morghi 02.ogg Morghi: General Mahamatra!? No, no! Mâ€”Make it quick, please! Swift and painless...
Media:vo xmaq106 6 morghi 03.ogg Morghi: Wâ€”Wait! We were just following orders! You know what I'm talking about, right? Thâ€”There's no way we could've done all this by ourselves!
Media:vo xmaq106 6 morghi 04.ogg Morghi: Pâ€”Please have mercy!
Media:vo xmaq106 6 morghi 05.ogg Morghi: I... I, uh, really don't know how to explain it...
Media:vo xmaq106 6 morghi 06.ogg Morghi: How did you know?
Media:vo xmaq106 6 morghi 07.ogg Morghi: Call it an educated guess... The Akademiya has been trying to figure out the exact source of the scholars' madness for centuries, but to no avail...
Media:vo xmaq106 6 morghi 08.ogg Morghi: Nobody can explain the cause of this phenomenon. Surely you can see what that implies, Scribe Alhaitham?
Media:vo xmaq106 6 morghi 09.ogg Morghi: If it's knowledge no mortal can comprehend, then it must be something only gods are able to decipher. In other words... it's the source of the God of Wisdom's omniscience and omnipotence.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 morghi 10.ogg Morghi: ...From the beginning, the Akademiya has never treated her as a god.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 morghi 11.ogg Morghi: When the Akademiya first discovered Lesser Lord Kusanali, the newborn God of Wisdom, the sages hoped that she would be as wise as Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. But upon evaluation...
Media:vo xmaq106 6 morghi 12.ogg Morghi: They found that, at that time, she possessed no more intelligence than any ordinary human child. The sages never had a ruder awakening... This forced them to accept that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata had indeed passed away.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 morghi 13.ogg Morghi: Not to mention that Lesser Lord Kusanali's Gnosis has been used to power the Akasha this entire time. By herself, she has neither an archon's raw power, nor the spectacular insight expected of a God of Wisdom...
Media:vo xmaq106 6 morghi 14.ogg Morghi: Slowly but surely, people began to forget about her existence.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We've been all over the desert trying to find you!
Media:vo xmaq106 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whoa, the moment they set eyes on Cyno, they turn pale like they've seen a ghost...
Media:vo xmaq106 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Well, you better start talking, or you'll be sorry!
Media:vo xmaq106 6 rahman 01.ogg Rahman: Everything's been arranged. Someone will bring the Village Keepers back to Aaru Village shortly.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 rahman 02.ogg Rahman: Don't mention it. I think we can both agree you went to hell and back for it.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 rahman 03.ogg Rahman: But we share a common cause now. From here on out, we're allies.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 rahman 04.ogg Rahman: I'll bring you to them. Follow me.
Media:vo xmaq106 6 rahman 05.ogg Rahman: Sure, as you wish.
Media:vo xmaq106 7 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: Hm, so you were still witholding some information?
Media:vo xmaq106 7 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: ...It seems like there will be more issues to face in the days ahead than I had anticipated.
Media:vo xmaq106 7 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: Indeed. These events are a flagrant transgression of the rules in every sense. We cannot allow it to continue.
Media:vo xmaq106 7 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: Well, let's brainstorm a little more about what other resources we can draw on.
Media:vo xmaq106 7 candace 01.ogg Candace: The Village Keepers you found have all been returned to their homes, and each one has a dedicated caregiver to look after them. The two new scholars are being kept under close supervision, too. Really great work, everyone.
Media:vo xmaq106 7 candace 02.ogg Candace: Or, I can go fetch some snacks...
Media:vo xmaq106 7 candace 03.ogg Candace: So, everyone, are we on the same page?
Media:vo xmaq106 7 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Do you have any plans, Traveler?
Media:vo xmaq106 7 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo xmaq106 7 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: It's time to make a plan.
Media:vo xmaq106 7 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: Crush the sages, and rescue our god... that is our ultimate goal.
Media:vo xmaq106 7 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: C'mon, is there... nothing left to talk about? In that case, let's all get some water and try to think about something else.
Media:vo xmaq106 7 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Gods above, you're not talking about work, are you...
Media:vo xmaq106 7 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: What a whirlwind of a story! I felt like I was holding my breath the whole time.
Media:vo xmaq106 7 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: Still, now's a good time to make our next move. Now that Rahman's joined us, we'll be an even stronger team.
Media:vo xmaq106 7 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: The next time we gather here, we must have a solid plan.
Media:vo xmaq106 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh... the atmosphere's so heavy...
Media:vo xmaq106 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hey, say something! Stop spacing out!
Media:vo xmaq106 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon's so coming with you!
Media:vo xmaq106 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Even though we lived through all of this firsthand, it still feels super surreal to hear you talk about it again.
Media:vo xmaq106 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Yep! It'll work out for sure!

Mysterious Message: After six days infiltrating the temple, I finally understand the priests' parlor tricks.
Mysterious Message: I leave this method here in hopes that the people of King Deshret who shall travel here in the future shall freely enjoy the privilege of witnessing his sacred presence.
Mysterious Message: Nonsense like "Forbidden ground ahead, mortals shall not pass" or whatever are just made up by the priests to hoodwink us.
Mysterious Message: The elevator will descend to the ground. Get on top of it before it starts ascending again to reach the dome.
Rahman Gang Member A: Don't you see this blade here...?
Rahman Gang Member A: Earthquake!
Rahman Gang Member A: Flame-Mane!
Rahman Gang Member A: Hey
Rahman Gang Member A: It's an...
Rahman Gang Member A: Wait a second...
Rahman Gang Member A: What do you think you're doing?
Rahman Gang Member B: Why are your hands shaking!?
Rahman Gang Member B: You coward!
Rahman takes some time to collect his thoughts, while the rest of the party continues to explore the temple.
Rahman's reaction is nothing strange. To any believer, the truth he had just witnessed would have been difficult to accept.
