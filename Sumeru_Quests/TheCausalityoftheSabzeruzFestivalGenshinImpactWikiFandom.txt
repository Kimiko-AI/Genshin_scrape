 ...That makes sense.
 And our memories of the day are erased every night.
 As expected, it's not as simple as we thought.
 But if the sages were behind this...
 Dehya's fighting skills have been improving.
 Dunyarzad's illness has also gotten worse...
 Have we ever tried leaving the city?
 How come... we've never thought about leaving the city?
 I suddenly realized that something is strange...
 I've thought about that, too.
 But if the sages were behind this...
 If they utilized the entire city's resources, as well as information supplied by the Akasha...
 If they utilized the entire city's resources, as well as information supplied by the Akasha...
 Instead, our memories are being erased at the end of each day.
 It is really strange.
 It seems we'll have to abandon this theory...
 Let me think...
 Let's just get straight to the point.
 Let's try again tomorrow.
 Maybe this is the key.
 Quest DescriptionThe samsara of the Sabzeruz Festival continues. Are you really getting close to the truth?
 Still the wrong conclusion, huh...
 The time loop theory is indeed incorrect.
 We aren't in a time loop...
 We don't actually need to explain everything.
 We should've thought of this a long time ago.
 We're not in a time loop.
 We're not in the real world.
 We've lived through this same day many times already.
 What will happen if we try to leave the city?
 You suddenly became proficient with your greatsword because...
 We've lived through this same day many times already.
 And our memories of the day are erased every night.

A plan has been set in motion somewhere unknown to you...
After going over what happened in detail, you believe the only plausible explanation is "Memory Deletion."

Media:Akasha Terminal Beep.ogg ???: *beep*
Media:vo dialog xmaq008 guard 01.ogg Media:vo dialog xmaq008 guard 02.ogg Guard: Hey! Stop right there! No one is allowed to enter or leave Sumeru City right now. Go away!
Media:vo dialog xmaq008 merchant 01.ogg Merchant: *sigh* How am I supposed to conduct business when I'm not allowed to leave the city?
Media:vo dialog xmaq008 paimon 01.ogg Media:vo dialog xmaq008 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whoa... Ugh, okay.
(The player is teleported a few steps back into the city)
Media:vo dialog xmaq010 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: We don't have many more festivals to waste. Hurry and find the truth.
Media:vo xmaq012 1 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: Would there have been a point? You would've spent the night with new worries, with tomorrow still out of reach.
Media:vo xmaq012 1 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: In that case ... You might as well rest within that brief moment of hope. An opportunity like that doesn't come by often, and I thought it might help you clear your minds.
Media:vo xmaq012 1 nahida 03.ogg Nahida: Hehe, of course. In the time we've been together, you two have been everything to me.
Media:vo xmaq012 1 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: Hehehe... What I mean is, even though I had asked you to solve this puzzle, you two are still the only ones who can see me and sense my presence.
Media:vo xmaq012 1 nahida 05.ogg Nahida: In other words, if you weren't here, I may as well not exist. That's why you two have been everything to me. Get it?
Media:vo xmaq012 1 nahida 06.ogg Nahida: Anyway, that's enough chit-chat. So Traveler, did the new clues yesterday help you gain a new understanding of the situation?
Media:vo xmaq012 1 nahida 07.ogg Nahida: So, what's your new hypothesis?
Media:vo xmaq012 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: ...We're still in the same day!
Media:vo xmaq012 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Nahida, you already knew last night that we didn't break out of the samsara! Why didn't you tell us?
Media:vo xmaq012 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Paimon thought the dook-dook did that! Ah, whatever, guess you were looking out for us after all.
Media:vo xmaq012 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Uh... Paimon's flattered and everything, but maybe you're taking things a little fast...
Media:vo xmaq012 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Uhh, Nahida's talking about confusing stuff again...
Media:vo xmaq012 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Huh? Why are you scrapping your previous theory?
Media:vo xmaq012 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Oh yeah, you're right. Gosh, how did we not notice that? In a simple time loop, people's physical conditions should also reset.
Media:vo xmaq012 10 hero 09.ogg Media:vo xmaq012 10 heroine 09.ogg (Traveler): Mercenaries rely heavily on muscle memory, and Dehya was able to use her experiences to avoid injury in later samsara cycles.
Media:vo xmaq012 10 hero 18.ogg Media:vo xmaq012 10 heroine 18.ogg (Traveler): If all our memories of a day are erased at the end of that day, then we would unwittingly relive the same day again and again.
Media:vo xmaq012 2 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: Um...
Media:vo xmaq012 2 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: ...Hm, a brilliant deduction.
Media:vo xmaq012 2 nahida 03.ogg Nahida: To put it simply, it's as if you've mistaken a Pyro Crystalfly for a Firefly in the night. You lost sight of its true nature because you focused too much on your perception that it glows.
Media:vo xmaq012 2 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: Why don't you go talk to Miss Dehya again? You might learn something new.
Media:vo xmaq012 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ooh! Then the beep we hear every night could just be indicating the deletion of our memories.
Media:vo xmaq012 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: That's why when we wake up, everyone thinks the Sabzeruz Festival hasn't happened yet. It's already the next day, but everyone still thinks it's the day before.
Media:vo xmaq012 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: But muscle memory can't be erased. That's why Dehya has been getting better at using her greatsword! Now everything makes sense!
Media:vo xmaq012 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Nahida, tell us if we're right or wrong!
Media:vo xmaq012 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: That isn't simple at all!
Media:vo xmaq012 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Right... She did help us find our latest clue, after all. Let's go!
Media:vo xmaq012 3 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: ...There you are. Really took me a while to find you.
Media:vo xmaq012 3 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Get hurt? Why would I? Don't underestimate me.
Media:vo xmaq012 3 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Truth be told, I also think it's pretty strange. It just suddenly felt so familiar in my hands... Wait a sec, how did you know I got a new greatsword to begin with? I didn't tell anyone about it...
Media:vo xmaq012 3 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: ...What happened to you guys while I was gone? Did you get brainwashed by some cult?
Media:vo xmaq012 3 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: ...Alright then. Let me get this straight. You're telling me that my body's already gotten used to this greatsword, but my brain just doesn't remember it?
Media:vo xmaq012 3 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: Then I'd have to disagree. That's impossible.
Media:vo xmaq012 3 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: If we've actually been reliving the Sabzeruz Festival day after day, then what happened to the things we used, the money we spent, the food we ate?
Media:vo xmaq012 3 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: Common sense says my wallet should've emptied itself a long time ago. There's no way I wouldn't have noticed that.
Media:vo xmaq012 3 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: No, it is impossible. I've got proof.
Media:vo xmaq012 3 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: *sigh* You two are surprisingly serious about this nonsensical discussion. Fine, I'll play along for a little longer.
Media:vo xmaq012 3 dehya 11.ogg Dehya: Come with me. Miss Dunyarzad, please come along as well. I still can't guarantee that this area is safe.
Media:vo xmaq012 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: As expected, Dehya also didn't get hurt today.
Media:vo xmaq012 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Well, you're still getting used to your new greatsword...
Media:vo xmaq012 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Traveler, could you explain the situation to her today? Paimon's gotten a little sick of doing it...
Media:vo xmaq012 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, that works.
Media:vo xmaq012 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Umm, don't think too hard about it. Just take what we're saying at face value.
Media:vo xmaq012 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Yes, your memory's being erased every day.
Media:vo xmaq012 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Oh? Why do you think that?
Media:vo xmaq012 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Right... They could use the Akasha to record what everyone did that day, and then use the city's resources to replenish everything...
Media:vo xmaq012 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: It's not very likely, but it's also not impossible.
Media:vo xmaq012 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: You have proof? Where?
Media:vo xmaq012 4 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: This is it.
Media:vo xmaq012 4 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: See those marks on the dummy? Those are the result of several days' worth of practice.
Media:vo xmaq012 4 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Let's say the sages didn't replace it every day. Shouldn't it be hacked to pieces by now?
Media:vo xmaq012 4 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: Then the sages would have had to reproduce every mark I left during previous training sessions.
Media:vo xmaq012 4 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: I'm a professional fighter. My martial school has always emphasized the importance of refined control.
Media:vo xmaq012 4 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: The force, angle, and entry point of each strike is calculated and deliberate. That's why I remember every mark on the dummy, as well as my state of mind as I made each strike.
Media:vo xmaq012 4 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: It's just as they say: Each swordsman has their own unique style, and even the same swordsman can't make the same cut twice. It would be impossible to copy these marks.
Media:vo xmaq012 4 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: People often say that a Kamera's photo can never replace an artist's painting because the former has no spirit to it.
Media:vo xmaq012 4 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: The same thing applies here. At a mere glance, I can differentiate carved marks from the results of combat training.
Media:vo xmaq012 4 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: Phew... I hope that cleared things up for you? Hey, is this that new Brainsercise game that's been super popular with the scholars lately? It's surprisingly fun.
Media:vo xmaq012 4 dehya 11.ogg Dehya: Anyway, it's getting late. I should escort Miss Dunyarzad to Nilou's stage. See ya later.
Media:vo xmaq012 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Paimon can't believe it's Dehya who wants to show us something this time. Two days ago, we were the ones taking her to see Dunyarzad...
Media:vo xmaq012 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? This a wooden training dummy. What about it?
Media:vo xmaq012 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: That's true, but what if they did?
Media:vo xmaq012 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Is it really impossible? What if they used some fancy machine to carve every single mark?
Media:vo xmaq012 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Welp, back to square one. Is our memory deletion theory also wrong? *sigh*
Media:vo xmaq012 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: But at least we've reached some other conclusions in the meantime?
Media:vo xmaq012 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Yep, that's true. So... can we think of any new ideas right now?
Media:vo xmaq012 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Strange? Paimon feels like everything's been strange lately...
Media:vo xmaq012 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Huh? Leaving the city... You're right! It's really strange how we never thought of such a simple solution. Many things should become clear if we can confirm the flow of time outside of the city.
Media:vo xmaq012 4 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Paimon can't believe it... Did we miss this because we're tunnel-visioning too hard on our other theories, or because we're just too tired?
Media:vo xmaq012 4 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: How about we go back and ask Nahida? Maybe we've forgotten something about leaving the city.
Media:vo xmaq012 5 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: You're back early today. Did you find something new?
Media:vo xmaq012 5 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: Leaving the city... As far as I remember, you've mentioned your plans to do that twice before...
Media:vo xmaq012 5 nahida 03.ogg Nahida: Let me think... I don't think you ever actually told me what the outcome was. Oh — it's probably more accurate to say that both times, you never came back the whole night.
Media:vo xmaq012 5 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: But you two sometimes stay out the entire night anyway, so at the time, I didn't think too much about it.
Media:vo xmaq012 5 nahida 05.ogg Nahida: Really? That's kinda strange. In theory, I should've already awakened all your memories.
Media:vo xmaq012 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Nahida, we're back!
Media:vo xmaq012 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Sort of. We're mostly sure now that we're not in a time loop, and we also aren't in the real world. But at the same time, we have a new question...
Media:vo xmaq012 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We did? But we don't remember anything! What happened after we talked about those plans? What did we say when we got back?
Media:vo xmaq012 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: It is true that sometimes we lose track of time during our investigations. Before we know it, it'll already be the next day. But still... neither of us remember anything about leaving town.
Media:vo xmaq012 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Yup! Something here's definitely fishy. Let's get to the bottom of this tomorrow!
Media:vo xmaq013 10 hero 01.ogg Media:vo xmaq013 10 heroine 01.ogg (Traveler): The Moon, illusions, and lies... What do they all mean?
Media:vo xmaq013 10 hero 06.ogg Media:vo xmaq013 10 heroine 06.ogg (Traveler): We've already experienced the Sabzeruz Festival many times. And... the day of the festival seems to be in a perpetual samsara.
Media:vo xmaq013 10 hero 08.ogg Media:vo xmaq013 10 heroine 08.ogg (Traveler): Okay, Nahida said, "The Akasha relies on the power of a Gnosis to operate, as it is the manifestation of the God of Wisdom's power. It compiles the wisdom of the entire populace, and it grants knowledge to the people."
Media:vo xmaq013 10 hero 10.ogg Media:vo xmaq013 10 heroine 10.ogg (Traveler): The beep is a prompt tone for Akasha operations. We still hear it every night, even though we removed our Akasha Terminals.
Media:vo xmaq013 10 hero 23.ogg Media:vo xmaq013 10 heroine 23.ogg (Traveler): That doesn't sound right... I need to carefully think things through...
