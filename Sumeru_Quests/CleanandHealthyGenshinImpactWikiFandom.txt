Golshan: By the way, Mr. Gurgen has been forcing himself to work again lately. I should take some more time to get him to change his mind...
Golshan: By the way, Mr. Aftab hasn't been following his diet lately. I'll have to discuss his medication with Dr. Zakariya...
Golshan: By the way, Ms. Azra seems a little down lately. Should I ask her about the situation or not...?
 Can't you just hire someone?
Golshan: Few would volunteer to work in a place full of patients. Besides, we don't have the budget to hire that many people.
Golshan: Normally we would split the cleaning into shifts, but no one is available right now.
Golshan: So, Traveler, could... could you help out?
Golshan: We will pay you! It won't be too much though...
 What's with the patients here, anyway...
Golshan: Most of our patients only suffer from minor ailments, such as headaches.
Golshan: Dr. Zakariya has told people many times that these conditions are not as scary as they think, but no one buys his explanations.
Golshan: I suppose that it might not be the disease they're afraid of, it's getting sick itself...
Golshan: I'll leave the cleaning to you then, Traveler.
 Could you tell me more about Zakariya?
Golshan: Dr. Zakariya is a great doctor and a devout believer of the Dendro Archon.
Golshan: He treats patients around the clock and hardly ever has time to eat.
Golshan: Dr. Zakariya even said that it's his duty to extend the blessings of the Dendro Archon to more people.
 Does the blessing of the Dendro Archon really matter that much in healing?
Golshan: To be precise, the act of "treatment" itself is the blessing of the Dendro Archon.
Golshan: It was by the grace of the Dendro Archon that we could find cures for patients and grow herbs to treat illnesses...
Golshan: Thank you, O Dendro Archon, for your blessing. May everyone be kept from maladies...
 How about you leave the cleaning to me?
Golshan: You'll help? That's very kind of you! I'll have the payment ready. It's just that... you might have to lower your expectations in that regard.
 I just noticed that you looked so worried...
 I'm just passing through...
 Quest DescriptionGolshan of Bimarstan is worrying about the sanitation conditions in the hospital...
 What's with the patients here, anyway...
 What's wrong?
 Yep.
Golshan: (*sigh* I wish I could have a break.)
Golshan: *sigh* But we can't spare any hands at the moment, and it's not like I can ask the patients with mild symptoms to help out...
Golshan: *sigh* How will we find anyone who will help at this hour...
Golshan: *sigh* May the Dendro Archon keep people safe from sickness...
Golshan: By the way, Mr. Aftab hasn't been following his diet lately. I'll have to discuss his medication with Dr. Zakariya...

Golshan: Few would volunteer to work in a place full of patients. Besides, we don't have the budget to hire that many people.
Golshan: Have you cleaned up the surrounding area?
Golshan: He said that only if the hospital and patients were kept clean, then they could more easily receive the blessing of the Dendro Archon.
Golshan: He treats patients around the clock and hardly ever has time to eat.
Golshan: Hehe... Was it that obvious? Well, you are right. I am worried about something.
Golshan: I can't thank you enough, Traveler. Please take this as your payment.
Golshan: I don't know why, but there's been an increasing number of people seeking treatment here at Bimarstan lately. Our staff have their hands full taking care of the patients.
Golshan: I suppose that it might not be the disease they're afraid of, it's getting sick itself...
Golshan: I'll leave the cleaning to you then, Traveler.
Golshan: It was by the grace of the Dendro Archon that we could find cures for patients and grow herbs to treat illnesses...
Golshan: Most of our patients only suffer from minor ailments, such as headaches.
Golshan: Normally we would split the cleaning into shifts, but no one is available right now.
Golshan: Oh! Hâ€”Hello there, Traveler. Are you here for treatment?
Golshan: So, Traveler, could... could you help out?
Golshan: Still, Dr. Zakariya insisted that I find ways to keep the surrounding area clean...
Golshan: Thank you, O Dendro Archon, for your blessing. May everyone be kept from maladies...
Golshan: There have been so many things that need taking care of lately, so I might have to bother you with cleanup duties next time as well.
Golshan: To be precise, the act of "treatment" itself is the blessing of the Dendro Archon.
Golshan: Traveler, is there anything you'd like to ask?
Golshan: We will pay you! It won't be too much though...
Golshan: You'll help? That's very kind of you! I'll have the payment ready. It's just that... you might have to lower your expectations in that regard.
