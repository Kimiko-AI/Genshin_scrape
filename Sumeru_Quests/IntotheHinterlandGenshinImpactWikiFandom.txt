 ...Nope, I don't see it.
 A very Paimon reason.
 Ah, I see.
 Anything in particular, or...?
 Are you running low on parts...?
 Are you wary of it?
 At the heart of the contaminated region?
 Banned research?
 Because the "conquest of nature" is bad?
 Do you not like this area of research?
 Doing fine so far.
 Expecting something?
 I can manage.
 I understand what you mean.
 I'll retrieve the pest-repelling devices.
 I'm a little dizzy.
 I'm still a little sleepy.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 02b.ogg Tighnari: You have to maintain constant vigilance in dangerous places like this. Yawning all the time like that is no good.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 02b 1.ogg Tighnari: If you can't stay awake, it's okay. Go sleep some more. I'm not tired yet.
 I can manage.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 02b 2.ogg Tighnari: Really? You don't need to push yourself. I'm used to staying up all night because many plant and animal species can only be observed during nighttime.
 It looks like it wants a reward again...
 It looks like it's...
 It's here!
 It's more useful than Paimon.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 paimon 08b.ogg Paimon: Hey!
 It's okay.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 paimon 05a.ogg Paimon: Really? You're not mad?
 Quest DescriptionWith the mechanical crab as your guide, it is time to head to the contaminated region.
 Step DescriptionAfter you defeat the gathered monsters, the mechanical crab suddenly starts to run wild.
 Step DescriptionAs it turns out, the mechanical crab had heard someone's cries for help and wanted to help. It seems to be quite different from the "ferocious" machine creatures as the people see them...
 Step DescriptionNow you understand how Tighnari feels. Make sure to retrieve all the camping equipment before you set out.
 Step DescriptionTighnari theorizes that the contaminated region was formed on account of a Ley Line effluence. Continue searching for clues nearby.
 Step DescriptionYou and Tighnari agree to trade guard shifts. It is your turn to rest first...
 Step DescriptionYour preparations are complete. It's time to go to the heart of the contaminated region.
 The Akademiya previously conducted research on mechanical life forms?
 They're brighter?
 They're more colorful?
 Very well.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 02a.ogg Tighnari: That's good. I was worried that you two wouldn't be able to sleep, so I specially used two of my homemade incenses.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 02a 1.ogg Tighnari: Don't worry, they're made from all-natural ingredients. They have a light fragrance and aren't harmful to the body.
 What's going on?
 You have my gratitude.
 Your punishment is solo watch duty.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 paimon 05b.ogg Paimon: Hehe. Don't worry, Paimon will be sure to stay awake next time!
Last night's pest-repelling devices are recovered...
Media:vo dialog tnllq002 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: How do you put out a fire...?
Media:vo dialog tnllq002 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Alright! Now that the fire's out, we just need to pack up the cooking pot...
Media:vo dialog tnllq002 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Guess it'll have to wait until we return.
Media:vo dialog tnllq002 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: I also just remembered that I forgot to apply essential oil to my tail. You probably noticed that it isn't as glossy as usual.
Media:vo dialog tnllq002 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Hmm... Perhaps one night doesn't make too much of a difference.
Media:vo dialog tnllq002 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: I'll make a new blend when we get back. It should make up for last night. I should have some leftover herbs from last month...
Media:vo dialog tnllq002 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: Hm? You're still awake?
Media:vo tnllq001 karkata doubt 01.ogg Mechanical Crab: Kulilu?
Media:vo tnllq001 karkata happy 01.ogg Mechanical Crab: Kolu!
Media:vo tnllq001 karkata refuse 01.ogg Mechanical Crab: Kelukulo.
Media:vo tnllq001 karkata upset 01.ogg Mechanical Crab: Kuli...
Media:vo tnllq002 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We're here! This should be... Huh? Where's the crab?
Media:vo tnllq002 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Did it secretly scuttle away?
Media:vo tnllq002 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: The mechanical crab went that way. Let's keep up!
Media:vo tnllq002 1 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: The traps weren't triggered, so it should still be here... Odd...
Media:vo tnllq002 1 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: You honored our agreement and waited here until we returned.
Media:vo tnllq002 1 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: As such, I'll hold up my end and give you another mechanical part. Keep it safe. I'm not giving you another one if you lose it.
Media:vo tnllq002 1 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Glad you're satisfied. If you want more mechanical parts, take us deeper into the contaminated region.
Media:vo tnllq002 1 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: I want to see what happened there — what caused the Avidya Forest to become like this.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Alright! Paimon also thinks it's a good spot!
Media:vo tnllq002 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: This place is perfect to put up a big tent!
Media:vo tnllq002 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We can also set up a cooking pot and cook tons of delicious food!
Media:vo tnllq002 10 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Leave it to Paimon! Paimon's a pro!
Media:vo tnllq002 10 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: *sob* (Traveler), Tighnari... Paimon couldn't find any food.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Paimon didn't know that rainforests had so many interesting plants until we came here! There were all sorts of weird-looking mushrooms, but Paimon didn't know which ones were edible.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Paimon also saw wild berries on the ground, and Paimon was gonna fly over and pick them up, but the dead leaves on top suddenly started moving! It freaked Paimon out!
Media:vo tnllq002 10 paimon 08b.ogg Paimon: Hey!
Media:vo tnllq002 10 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Paimon understands it this time! It wants mechanical parts again!
Media:vo tnllq002 10 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: It looks really sad...
Media:vo tnllq002 10 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: We need lookouts?
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Let's set up camp here.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Oh? Any particular reason?
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: You're not wrong, but the primary reason for choosing this place is because its higher elevation keeps us away from the water vapor below.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Rainforests are very wet. You should always be careful when spending the night in damp places.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: For the next tasks at hand, let's divide and conquer. I'll set up the tent, you'll be in charge of making the fire, and Paimon will forage for edibles nearby.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: I'm not expecting that much. Just do what you can.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: That's right. You can use rushes to start a fire in the wilderness.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Their piths are relatively dry and can be readily set aflame. The downside is that they produce a lot of smoke.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: Those were probably Deadleaf Butterflies. They camouflage as dead leaves to evade predators.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: My guess is that they mistook you for a bird when you flew over, so they fled. Little did they know that you were more scared than they were.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: Never mind. The tent's up, so you two go rest. I'll forage for food.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 12.ogg Tighnari: Oh? You found some already.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 13.ogg Tighnari: Sorry, no part this time.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 14.ogg Tighnari: That task wasn't important enough. If every little thing resulted in a reward, then it might start to take advantage of the system.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 15.ogg Tighnari: I'll note little things like this and give a cumulative reward at a later time.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 16.ogg Tighnari: Ahem, that is one reason.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 17.ogg Tighnari: ...After some further thought, it might come up with some weird misunderstanding if I don't give it something. Alright, here's another for you.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 18.ogg Tighnari: I'm off to prepare dinner. We'll take shifts on lookout duty tonight. You two can sleep first. I'll wake you up later.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 19.ogg Tighnari: Yes.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 20.ogg Tighnari: Even though most animals fled because of the Ley Lines, we can't completely let down our guard.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 21.ogg Tighnari: It's settled, then. I'll set up some pest-repelling devices so poisonous insects don't come crawling into the tent.
Media:vo tnllq002 10 tighnari 22.ogg Tighnari: Have a good night. Not too good, though.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Paimon's getting sleepy... Ah! Is this because of the Ley Lines?
Media:vo tnllq002 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's been a while since we camped outside like this!
Media:vo tnllq002 11 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hehe... This feels like when we just started adventuring together! Nighty night! (Traveler)!
Media:vo tnllq002 11 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: S—Sorry, (Traveler), Paimon slept through the entire night...
Media:vo tnllq002 11 paimon 05a.ogg Paimon: Really? You're not mad?
Media:vo tnllq002 11 paimon 05b.ogg Paimon: Hehe. Don't worry, Paimon will be sure to stay awake next time!
Media:vo tnllq002 11 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Is there something we can do?
Media:vo tnllq002 11 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Got it! Paimon will take care of the fire!
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Hm? You're awake earlier than I expected. Did you sleep well?
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 02a 1.ogg Tighnari: Don't worry, they're made from all-natural ingredients. They have a light fragrance and aren't harmful to the body.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 02a.ogg Tighnari: That's good. I was worried that you two wouldn't be able to sleep, so I specially used two of my homemade incenses.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 02b 1.ogg Tighnari: If you can't stay awake, it's okay. Go sleep some more. I'm not tired yet.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 02b 2.ogg Tighnari: Really? You don't need to push yourself. I'm used to staying up all night because many plant and animal species can only be observed during nighttime.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 02b.ogg Tighnari: You have to maintain constant vigilance in dangerous places like this. Yawning all the time like that is no good.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Speaking of which, have you seen the crab?
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: It was scampering around over there just now, but I don't know where it went.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: So you can tell. My suspicion is less towards the crab, and more directed to its unrevealed owner.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: A Ley Line effluence of this magnitude occurred without any warning. Someone probably disrupted the natural flow of the Ley Lines.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: Until we fully understand the situation, take extra caution. The Akademiya has banned mechanical life form research for years, so the origin of these creatures is very suspect.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Topics related to mechanical life forms were popular in the Spantamad for a time. Some of my juniors had also thrown themselves into such research.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: They proposed an intriguing idea: Use our knowledge to create a "new and practical" life form that could help humanity "conquer nature."
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: However, no matter which modules or parts are installed, a machine is innately a construct that receives and executes commands. They can never possess self-awareness like us or other living organisms.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: In their pursuit to discover the differences between mechanical and biological life forms, zealous researchers performed unregulated vivisections and other absurdly cruel experiments on animals. Research on mechanical life forms was thus banned.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 12.ogg Tighnari: The irony is that the researchers became even more impetuous afterward. Who knows, maybe the subject will be unbanned in a few years.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 13.ogg Tighnari: Hmm... That's a difficult question to answer.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 14.ogg Tighnari: I'm interested in the topic of mechanical life, but I don't like the researchers' attitudes.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 15.ogg Tighnari: It's just my personal opinion.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 16.ogg Tighnari: My ancestors and the Valuka Shuna of the desert coexisted together and supported one another. The bloodline of my people was born from this symbiotic relationship.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 17.ogg Tighnari: So to me, all life is important. To understand life, you must first respect it.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 18.ogg Tighnari: Life is not an expendable commodity, and knowledge should not be wielded like a scepter. These are the points of contention I have with some researchers, and why I left the Akademiya.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 19.ogg Tighnari: By placing yourself above other life forms, what kind of results do you expect to get from researching pure life with impure intentions?
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 20.ogg Tighnari: Really? Well, I'm glad to hear it.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 21.ogg Tighnari: Coffee? Did you prepare this for us?
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 22.ogg Tighnari: Alright, seeing that you're working so hard to help out, I'll give you another part.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 23.ogg Tighnari: You're not planning on using it? Many of your own parts are critically degraded, and you're running low on power.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 24a.ogg Tighnari: Alright, suit yourself. Oh and thanks for the coffee, but I'm about to go to sleep. Leave it with (Traveler).
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 25.ogg Tighnari: The night watch is yours. Stay safe.
(Time skips ahead to daylight)
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 26.ogg Tighnari: Good morning, (Traveler) and Paimon. Quick question, do you feel off at all?
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 27.ogg Tighnari: Me too. The farther in we go, the closer we get to the source of the Ley Line effluence. We'll be heading out earlier today. I'll take down the tent.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 28.ogg Tighnari: Extinguish our fire so we don't set the entire forest aflame.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 29.ogg Tighnari: Also, retrieve the pest-repelling devices from last night. We don't want to affect the ecosystem here.
Media:vo tnllq002 11 tighnari 30.ogg Tighnari: Alright. Let's meet back here later.
Media:vo tnllq002 14 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Alright, it's about time to head out. As we go further in, we may encounter more berserk machines.
Media:vo tnllq002 14 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: The effects of the Ley Lines will also increase. If you're struggling, it would be wise to avoid conflict.
Media:vo tnllq002 14 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Try to conserve as much energy as possible until we reach the source of the contamination.
Media:vo tnllq002 14 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: As I thought. The closer we get to the contamination's source, the more mechanical monsters that appear...
Media:vo tnllq002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So this is the contaminated region that everyone's been talking about... It definitely looks different from normal!
Media:vo tnllq002 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's like... really creepy and suffocating...
Media:vo tnllq002 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: How do you know that?
Media:vo tnllq002 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: You're saying that the contamination here is coming from Ley Lines?
Media:vo tnllq002 2 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Do you feel unwell at all?
Media:vo tnllq002 2 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Good. It's as I predicted: Elemental power confers a degree of resistance against the contaminated region's influence.
Media:vo tnllq002 2 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: I haven't entered the contaminated region for a proper investigation, but I've conducted quite a few controlled experiments.
Media:vo tnllq002 2 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: My observations during our time here have all but confirmed my hypothesis. Look at these flowers. How are they different from normal?
Media:vo tnllq002 2 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: This flower species is formally known as the "Sumeru Rose," but it is also known as the "Ley Line Lodestar."
Media:vo tnllq002 2 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: They're sensitive to Ley Lines and emit varying amounts of light in response. Excessive brightness indicates a dangerous level of Ley Line activity in the surrounding area.
Media:vo tnllq002 2 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: From the looks of things, the Ley Lines around here are already out of control.
Media:vo tnllq002 2 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: I can't confirm that right now, but I think that is the case.
Media:vo tnllq002 2 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: Let's take another look around and see if we can discover more clues.
Media:vo tnllq002 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: You know, we haven't seen any animals this entire time!
Media:vo tnllq002 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: The birds used to chirp really loudly, and there were a lot of foxes...
Media:vo tnllq002 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Leaky Ley Lines sure can cause a lot of damage, huh?
Media:vo tnllq002 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Then why are we okay?
Media:vo tnllq002 3 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: The contaminated region currently appears to have a critical efflux of Ley Line energy, which is probably the root cause of the patients' cognitive disturbances.
Media:vo tnllq002 3 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Some animals have keen awareness. They sensed something abnormal in this area and fled.
Media:vo tnllq002 3 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Like how plants have preferred growth conditions, we also gradually habituate to our surrounding environment.
Media:vo tnllq002 3 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Climate, temperature, humidity, intensity of Ley Line energies. When people live under fixed conditions, they reach a sort of "homeostasis" with their environment.
Media:vo tnllq002 3 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: This equilibrium is broken when the surrounding environment abruptly changes, causing people's bodies to react in abnormal ways.
Media:vo tnllq002 3 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: If normal fluctuations in temperature occur, then our bodies automatically adjust. However, the average person cannot adapt to changes in Ley Line energy, and so they fall ill.
Media:vo tnllq002 3 tighnari 07a.ogg Tighnari: I'm not sure why you are, but (Traveler) and I are fine because our elemental capabilities allow us to adapt to this kind of change.
Media:vo tnllq002 3 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Of course, it's not a good idea to spend too much time in areas with concentrated Ley Line energy. The only one who can freely traverse this place is probably the mechanical crab.
Media:vo tnllq002 3 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: That's about it for the investigation. Help me find an open space. I want to test something.
Media:vo tnllq002 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What's this?
Media:vo tnllq002 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What a neat thing! Let's set up more and cover the entire region!
Media:vo tnllq002 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh? The mechanical crab is acting a little strange.
Media:vo tnllq002 4 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Environment... No wind... Target parameters... Normal...
Media:vo tnllq002 4 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Setup complete. Excellent — looks like it's working.
Media:vo tnllq002 4 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: A Purification Device that I made. It can absorb excess Ley Line energy and temporarily stabilize an area.
Media:vo tnllq002 4 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: I wouldn't mind if that would actually work. Unfortunately, once this "contamination" is present, it isn't something that a few Purification Devices can fix.
Media:vo tnllq002 4 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: The Purification Devices have their limits. At best, they can only prevent the contaminated region from expanding temporarily.
Media:vo tnllq002 4 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: If we want to permanently eradicate the contamination from the Ley Line effluence, we'll need to tackle the source.
Media:vo tnllq002 4 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: That's right.
Media:vo tnllq002 4 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Something's approaching...
Media:vo tnllq002 4 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: So that's it. Now that the Ley Line energy has stabilized, the monsters that had left are starting to return.
Media:vo tnllq002 4 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: Get rid of them quickly! Don't let them get close to the Purification Device!
Media:vo tnllq002 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whew... That's all of them.
Media:vo tnllq002 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hey, where are you— Wait for us!
Media:vo tnllq002 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Let's hurry and keep up, (Traveler)!
Media:vo tnllq002 7 jasar 01.ogg Jasar: Help! Heeelp!
Media:vo tnllq002 7 jasar 02.ogg Jasar: Aaah... Spare me, please spare me!
Media:vo tnllq002 7 jasar 03.ogg Jasar: Who are you all? What happened to those mechanical monsters?
Media:vo tnllq002 7 jasar 04.ogg Jasar: Good. Haha... That's good...
Media:vo tnllq002 7 jasar 05.ogg Jasar: Aaah, it's a monster! Hurry, attack it!
Media:vo tnllq002 7 jasar 06.ogg Jasar: It's faking it — it has to be! Maybe it's gonna partner up with the other mechanical monsters and kill me!
Media:vo tnllq002 7 jasar 07.ogg Jasar: Do you know what's inside the forest? It's all... It's all crawling with mechanical freaks!
Media:vo tnllq002 7 jasar 08.ogg Jasar: I just came here to pick herbs, but I accidentally went into the contaminated region and almost died.
Media:vo tnllq002 7 jasar 09.ogg Jasar: I gotta get out of here. Yes... Yes, I have to escape...
Media:vo tnllq002 7 jasar 10.ogg Jasar: Be careful. These mechanical life forms are up to no good. It'd be best if you stayed far, far away from them!
Media:vo tnllq002 7 jasar 11.ogg Jasar: No wonder the Akademiya wanted to completely ban the existence of mechanical life forms. Those things should be annihilated...
Media:vo tnllq002 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, are you okay?
Media:vo tnllq002 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Don't worry, we took care of them!
Media:vo tnllq002 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: How do we explain this? Crabby here isn't a bad guy.
Media:vo tnllq002 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: It heard you shouting for help and brought us here to rescue you.
Media:vo tnllq002 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Are you okay?
Media:vo tnllq002 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: It's so hard to understand...
Media:vo tnllq002 7 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Okay, it definitely doesn't understand you.
Media:vo tnllq002 7 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: These injuries are superficial. Don't move. I'll patch you up.
Media:vo tnllq002 7 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: ...
Media:vo tnllq002 7 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: His inarticulate speech and bodily tremors indicate psyche disruption. He's been inside the contaminated region for too long.
Media:vo tnllq002 7 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: We've purified the Ley Line energy over there. Follow this path out and you'll soon see the village.
(Jasar runs off)
