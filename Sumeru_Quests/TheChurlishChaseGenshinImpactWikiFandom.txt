Le Goff: 'Tis but a shame that my goods are lost... Despite your aid, they did not escape their torturers' clutches...

Le Goff: *sigh* Well, at least I was able to preserve my life. I will consider the rest later... So please, take these as a sign of my thanks, friend.

Le Goff: Even my cargo has been sheltered 'neath your great protection. And here I was sure that they were lost, lost for sure at the hands of these hilichurls...

Le Goff: To be honest, I cannot understand why these fellows keep chasing me as well... But thanks to you, I was able to protect my cargo this time.
Le Goff: Ah yes! Here's a token of my appreciation! Please accept it, my friend. You deserve it!
 Again, seriously?
 Quest DescriptionLe Goff, a merchant transporting goods, is being robbed by the hilichurls. He is in urgent need of help...
Le Goff: 'Tis but a shame that my goods are lost... Despite your aid, they did not escape their torturers' clutches...
Le Goff: *sigh* Well, at least I was able to preserve my life. I will consider the rest later... So please, take these as a sign of my thanks, friend.
Le Goff: Ah yes! Here's a token of my appreciation! Please accept it, my friend. You deserve it!
Le Goff: Ah, thank you, my friend, thank you!
Le Goff: And when I had finally gotten far enough away to look back at the scene of the crime... They had put all the clothes in a pile, looking to make a fire with which to barbecue some meat...
Le Goff: And you know what? I saw, with my very own eyes, the mushroom caravan in front of me pass them by, safe and sound! Right in front of their noses, even!
Le Goff: As you have seen. I am a traveling merchant from Fontaine, and all my goods are the latest and the greatest.
Le Goff: Aye, yes! These fellows are to me a nightmare inescapable...
Le Goff: But that is precisely why these louts always target me when I'm transporting goods...
Le Goff: Do these churls just have it in for me or something? I mean, I'm all the way here in Sumeru now, you know?
Le Goff: Even my cargo has been sheltered 'neath your great protection. And here I was sure that they were lost, lost for sure at the hands of these hilichurls...
Le Goff: Previously, they even hid at the mouth of the main road, successfully stealing a batch of the latest apparel from Fontaine...
Le Goff: To be honest, I cannot understand why these fellows keep chasing me as well... But thanks to you, I was able to protect my cargo this time.
Le Goff: To have met such a friendly traveler in another land. Truly, I feel like a man encountering an oasis amidst an endless desert!

Paimon: Let's go save 'em!
Paimon: Oh dear... Those burned clothes could've sold for enough to buy loads of grilled meat... Even Paimon thinks that was a huge waste.
