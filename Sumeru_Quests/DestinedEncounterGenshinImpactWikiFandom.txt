 ...
 ...?
 ...I'm guessing you've been to Sumeru before?
 All the way back then?
 Alright.
 And we'd point at the planets we wanted to visit.
 And you too, Teyvat!
 Are we waiting for the perfect moment?
 Are you concerned about the Abyss Order?
 Don't worry about it, Paimon.
 Don't worry about it.
 Goodnight then, Paimon.
 Great. Well, lemme see this letter.
 I think... I guess.
 I thought my sibling was the founder...
 I trust you, Kaeya.
 If nothing else... I just want to know what happened.
 If you say so.
 It's just a regular mirror.
 It's just broken.
 Just you wait, Heavenly Principles!
 Khaenri'ah...
 Lemme see this letter. I'm really curious who could've sent it...
 Not really. You're better than nothing, I guess.
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 05b 1.ogg Paimon: Hmph, okay, fine. Paimon shoulda known you weren't gonna say anything nice.
 Paimon, is that you?
 Paimon, this isn't the time for hide-and-seek...
 Quest DescriptionMasrur at Port Ormos is currently worrying himself sick over a letter with an unclear address...
 So that was already a thing several centuries ago?
 So what do you plan to do here in Sumeru?
 So, you said that an Alberich founded the Abyss Order?
 Speaking of Khaenri'ah... How much do you know about it?
 Thank you, Paimon.
 The Abyss Order...?
 This is definitely Kaeya's style.
 This is the first time we've ever been separated.
 Uh-huh... Very believable.
 Very scheming indeed...
 We saw all manner of hope and despair.
 This is the first time we've ever been separated.
 If nothing else... I just want to know what happened.
 We traveled through the universe, always by each other's side...
 This is the first time we've ever been separated.
 If nothing else... I just want to know what happened.
 We'd gaze at the stars, just like this.
 We've missed you too.
 Well, freeloading comes more naturally to you than most...
 Well, no harm done. It'll be nice to catch up with him.
 Well, this a first. Paimon, not going to bed before me?
 What in the world is going through your head...
 Yeah. Can't say I'm hugely surprised.
 You came to Sumeru all on your own. So you must be quite familiar with the place.
 You don't have to go into great detail.
 You make my day every day, Paimon.
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 05a 1.ogg Paimon: ...Aww, oh you, stop it! Now you're embarrassing Paimon...
 You sure are going places with your paranoia...
 You're easy to please.
 You've got a new lead?
 You? Terrified? I don't buy it.
(The Traveler opens their eyes and sees Dainsleif in blurry vision)
(Traveler): (...)
(Traveler): (...Dain?)
(Traveler): (Ah, I vaguely remember Dain coming over. Did Paimon go into the woods with him, seeing how I hadn't woken up yet?)
(Traveler): (Hmm? How did I sleep till morning? Why didn't Paimon wake me up to switch shifts? ... Hang on a moment... Where IS Paimon, anyway?)
(Traveler): (Huh? Why're you going back into the forest...)
(The Traveler falls back asleep)
(Traveler): (No reply... I should go inside and check.)
(Traveler): (Wait, did that noise come from... inside the house?)
(Traveler): (Whatever the case, looks like it's just me here for now. Guess it's time to stretch my limbs and have a look around.)
???: (Clatter...)
A familiar face joins your conversation.
After Dain finishes his drink, you prepare to travel to Avidya Forest...
It's been a while. How have you been?I've heard that the two of you are traveling in Sumeru,And I happen to be in Port Ormos on official business.Lately, I've been stopping by Djafar Tavern for a drink or two every afternoon.If luck's on my side, and this letter successfully reaches you...Come to me then and we can catch up on old times.We'll see it as a fated encounter.— Your Trusty Buddy, Kaeya
Kaeya leaves.
Media:vo dialog szaq201 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Oho? What a coincidence, I just finished my talks with the Sumeru merchant. Didn't expect to bump into you again.
Media:vo dialog szaq201 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Shall we head back to the tavern for a drink? I'd like to chat with you about what happened during last year's Windblume Festival. Now that was really...
Media:vo dialog szaq201 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: ...Ah, I see you have other things to do with your time. Busy as ever, hmm? Alright then, remember to come see me at the Angel's Share when next you're in Mondstadt. Safe travels.
Media:vo dialog szaq201 masrur 01.ogg Masrur: This was a first for me. It's a good thing luck was on my side...
Media:vo szaq201 1 masrur 01.ogg Masrur: Huh? Wait, you're that blond traveler who's on a journey to all corners of Teyvat, right?
Media:vo szaq201 1 masrur 02.ogg Masrur: You bet I do! Phew, I was worried I wouldn't be able to find you! I have a letter for you, you see — it's from another outlander...
Media:vo szaq201 1 masrur 03.ogg Masrur: He was a crafty fellow, lemme tell you... Took advantage of a loophole in our mailing system by opting for Guaranteed Delivery then filling in the most obscure mailing address I've ever seen!
Media:vo szaq201 1 masrur 04.ogg Masrur: Uh... he just wrote, "next to a small, white-haired talking fairy."
Media:vo szaq201 1 masrur 05.ogg Masrur: *sigh* Exactly, right? And if I'd failed to deliver the letter, I'd have been bound by regulation to compensate him...
Media:vo szaq201 1 masrur 06.ogg Masrur: Really, he got me good. I count myself very lucky that I ran into you here.
Media:vo szaq201 1 masrur 07.ogg Masrur: Of course, here it is. All yours!
Media:vo szaq201 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Who's asking...? Do you need something from us?
Media:vo szaq201 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Well, we are always on the road, so yeah, it's pretty tough to get mail to us unless we happen to go to the post office on a whim...
Media:vo szaq201 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So, um... what address did that person give you, anyway?
Media:vo szaq201 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: What!? So the address is Paimon!?
Media:vo szaq201 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: C'mon, Paimon wants to have a look, too!
It's been a while. How have you been?I've heard that the two of you are traveling in Sumeru,And I happen to be in Port Ormos on official business.Lately, I've been stopping by Djafar Tavern for a drink or two every afternoon.If luck's on my side, and this letter successfully reaches you...Come to me then and we can catch up on old times.We'll see it as a fated encounter.— Your Trusty Buddy, Kaeya
Media:vo szaq201 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Kaeya, huh? So he's here in Sumeru... Hmm, now that Paimon thinks about it, "crafty" does describe him pretty well.
Media:vo szaq201 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: From what he wrote in the letter, it looks like he didn't think there was much chance of it reaching us...
Media:vo szaq201 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Hmm, or maybe he's just being sneaky... Do you think he's making this sound like a miracle of fate so that we'd have to go meet up with him?
Media:vo szaq201 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Eh, yeah, you're right. It's always nice to see old friends!
Media:vo szaq201 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: The letter says that he hangs out at Djafar Tavern every afternoon. Perhaps we should drop in on him then, huh?
(Obtain Wine-Scented Letter)
Media:vo szaq201 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: There's a box over here. Why don't we open it? Uh, and by "we," Paimon means you... Paimon's just scared that... whatever's inside might bite her fingertips off...
Media:vo szaq201 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? This is... a mirror.
Media:vo szaq201 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: It's broken, too. Was this a makeup box?
Media:vo szaq201 10 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hmm. That's kinda... disappointing. Paimon was hoping we'd uncover some super big secret, especially after Dain talked this place up.
Media:vo szaq201 11 dainslaif 01.ogg Dainsleif: My memories are quite foggy, but my subconscious and instincts both assert that something once happened here.
Media:vo szaq201 11 dainslaif 02.ogg Dainsleif: But, we'll exhaust ourselves if we search aimlessly... I hear noises outside. Let's go and check.
Media:vo szaq201 11 dainslaif 03.ogg Dainsleif: It's not much. Just some minor adversaries.
Media:vo szaq201 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Doesn't look like there's anything else worth our attention here. You sure we're in the right place, Dain?
Media:vo szaq201 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Noises? Is it...
Media:vo szaq201 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Monsters! Wow, Dain's ears are sharp, just like his nose. He's in surprisingly good shape for a 500-year-old...
Media:vo szaq201 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmm, although for someone who's as full of surprises as Dain, it's hardly a big deal... Anyway, let's beat up these monsters!
Media:vo szaq201 13 dainslaif 01.ogg Dainsleif: I doubt that the appearance of those monsters was wholly random. There must be something nearby that attracted them.
Media:vo szaq201 13 dainslaif 02.ogg Dainsleif: A Ley Line anomaly, perhaps? ...Hmm, but it seems to be more than that.
Media:vo szaq201 13 dainslaif 03.ogg Dainsleif: Okay — I'll go slightly further out to investigate any issues with the nearby Ley Lines. I might be a while. You should wait for me here.
Media:vo szaq201 13 dainslaif 04.ogg Dainsleif: ...Your suspicions are as banal as they are unwarranted. I merely think that this house should remain the focus of our investigation, and as such, someone ought to stay here and keep an eye on it.
Media:vo szaq201 13 dainslaif 05.ogg Dainsleif: Not to mention that if even Forest Rangers are capable of investigating Ley Lines, I will be more than able to handle it alone.
Media:vo szaq201 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What? You're going alone? You'd better not be trying to keep some secret from us!
Media:vo szaq201 13 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ugh, fair enough. Guess we'll just camp out here, then?
Media:vo szaq201 13 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Good thing there's a fireplace over there. Let's make ourselves something to eat! All this running around has made Paimon real hungry.
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ahh, your cooking is as good as ever! Even if there was no other reason, the food alone would be enough for Paimon to stick with you, hee-hee!
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Changing the subject, Dain's taking forever! He said that there might be an issue with the nearby Ley Lines... How bad do you think it could be?
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: *sigh* We came together, but now it's back to just being the two of us again... Y'know, now that Paimon mentions it, we really have spent lots and lots of time together, haven't we?
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Um, so... don't take this the wrong way or anything, but, uh... d—do you ever get tired of Paimon being around?
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 05a 1.ogg Paimon: ...Aww, oh you, stop it! Now you're embarrassing Paimon...
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 05b 1.ogg Paimon: Hmph, okay, fine. Paimon shoulda known you weren't gonna say anything nice.
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 06a.ogg Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 06b.ogg Paimon: Hmm... So, um, next question... Don't know if it's okay to ask this, but Paimon's curious: What was it like traveling with your (sister/brother)?
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: The stars?
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Wow...
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Yeah... Paimon understands. Being separated without even knowing the reason why... it's just terrible.
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: But we'll find the truth together, sure as Paimon's your guide! Just you wait, Heavenly Principles! And you too, Teyvat!
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Hehe. Y'know what? We've talked too long about this sad stuff. Let's talk about something happy instead! 'Cause if you're sad... Paimon will be too.
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Alright, alright. It's getting dark, so why don't you rest? Paimon will take first watch. Don't worry, no monster's gonna come and eat you up!
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Oh, come on, don't say that... Paimon just wants to look after you for once.
Media:vo szaq201 14 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Nighty-night! Go on, shoo, off to sleep!
Media:vo szaq201 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Kaeya should be at Djafar Tavern right now. Let's go see him!
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 01.ogg Dainsleif: ...One Death After Noon please, Boss.
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 02.ogg Dainsleif: Tell me... what do you know about the significance of that name, "Alberich"?
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 03.ogg Dainsleif: So you remember me. Then we are already acquainted, Kaeya Alberich... descendant of the Abyss Order's founder.
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 04.ogg Dainsleif: I take it that you weren't aware of this until now, Kaeya, or you wouldn't have been so forthcoming with your surname.
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 05.ogg Dainsleif: I'm surprised that you take me at my word without the faintest hint of skepticism...
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 06.ogg Dainsleif: Very clever. Forgive me for being direct, but I sincerely hope this new knowledge doesn't change anything. If you've already let go of your ties to the past... then keep it that way.
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 07.ogg Dainsleif: Hmph...
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 08.ogg Dainsleif: The fact is, I still do not know him well. It would be meaningless for me to jump to conclusions.
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 09.ogg Dainsleif: But can a person truly be unaffected by their ancestry? This remains to be seen.
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 10a.ogg Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 10b.ogg Dainsleif: Well, I suspect that they call your (sister/brother) their (Princess/Prince) precisely because there is a succession of sorts.
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 11.ogg Dainsleif: I mean to investigate the "Loom of Fate." Do you remember that name?
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 12.ogg Dainsleif: Not new. Not exactly... My memories suffer from erosion, but while I was recovering my health recently, I suddenly remembered something...
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 13a.ogg Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 13b.ogg Dainsleif: Your (sister/brother)... (she/he) mentioned the "Loom of Fate" back when we traveled together.
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 14.ogg Dainsleif: Apparently so. I was also quite surprised when these memories tallied up. I recall that we were traveling to Sumeru when the matter was brought up.
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 15.ogg Dainsleif: Correct. At that time, they must have been introduced, in one way or another, to this concept. If I recall correctly, we were somewhere in Avidya Forest then...
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 16.ogg Dainsleif: No. Now is not the time.
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 17.ogg Dainsleif: No, it's just...
Media:vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 18.ogg Dainsleif: I'm still waiting for my drink.
Media:vo szaq201 4 eymen 01.ogg Eymen: Um... Sorry, Sir, I'm afraid you've already tried every type of liquor we serve...
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: ...I'll have something I haven't tried yet, Boss.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Oh? Well then, just the bill, please. It's just as well, I suppose. I do have other matters to attend to...
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Hey, Paimon, (Traveler). Looks like the gods smile upon me after all. And come now, I wouldn't joke about wanting to see my good friends, haha...
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Hahaha, not at all. The Acting Grand Master positively terrifies me. Why would I ever do anything that might displease her?
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: The truth is, I'm in Sumeru to learn about the alcohol industry here. So despite how it might look, I'm actually at Djafar Tavern for strictly business purposes.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Sumeru's spices are famous the world over, and it's long been rumored that this fine establishment was where a certain very popular spiced cocktail was invented.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: That's why the Knights sent me, their foremost expert in alcoholic beverages, to come and see if it is as good as the rumors say.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: So far so good... I'm already in talks with some spice merchants in Port Ormos about some potential collaboration.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves... Whether this lucrative opportunity gets passed along to Dawn Winery or not depends on how nice I'm feeling... Hahaha.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: Oh? What makes you say that?
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Very sharp of you... I wouldn't say I'm familiar, though. I just came here on the sly once, when I was very young.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: ...
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: Heh... Do I have to? When I said we could talk about the old times, digging up my past wasn't exactly what I had in mind...
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: Well, alright, since you're so interested... Like I said, I was very young then. Dawn Winery had only just taken me in.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: I overheard my adoptive father talk about sending a team of merchants to Sumeru during a business meeting.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: I'm sure you'll agree that everyone's curious about their roots on some level. And my roots... They're in Khaenri'ah, which is said to have been located deep underground somewhere near Sumeru.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 17.ogg Kaeya: And so I stowed myself away amidst the cargo, and silently joined the merchant delegation on their trip to Sumeru...
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 18.ogg Kaeya: But it wasn't long before the merchant delegation received news that I'd gone missing. Their leader promptly found me, and before I knew it, my adoptive father was dragging me back home by the ear...
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 19.ogg Kaeya: It was a short-lived adventure. Sorry I don't have a more thrilling story for you, hehe...
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 20.ogg Kaeya: Honestly, not much. The only reason I knew that Khaenri'ah was near Sumeru is because I happened to read that in a book when I was young.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 21.ogg Kaeya: My life had less and less to do with Khaenri'ah as I grew up, and so I started caring less as well.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 22.ogg Kaeya: I used to believe that I had inherited some sort of duty from my father...
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 23.ogg Kaeya: But then I began to wonder... Maybe my father left me in the peaceful land of Mondstadt for no other reason than simply to give me a happier life...
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 24.ogg Kaeya: A happy life sounds good to me, of course. Even if it means being cut off from... certain things.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 25.ogg Kaeya: ...This is obviously all speculation. Simply put, I'm afraid that I'm not particularly in the know on this topic.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 26.ogg Kaeya: These days, my surname, Alberich, is probably the only link to Khaenri'ah that I have left.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 27.ogg Kaeya: Ah, you've decided to join us? I was wondering how long you planned on listening in. I believe I've seen you before in Mondstadt... Dainsleif, if I'm not mistaken?
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 28.ogg Kaeya: ...
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 29.ogg Kaeya: Oh, my... that's quite a lot of baggage for a surname, isn't it? Though I must say, it does confirm an old suspicion of mine. I suppose that was why my father left me in Mondstadt after all...
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 30.ogg Kaeya: Well, perhaps what you told me just happens to answer some questions I carry in my memories. And, in any case... I recognize your eyes...
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 31.ogg Kaeya: You're a pure-blood Khaenri'ahn, aren't you?
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 32.ogg Kaeya: Hey, hold on now. This conversation has taken a rather sudden turn for the deadly serious... and I'm afraid that as someone from Mondstadt, I'm not accustomed to this sort of atmosphere...
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 33.ogg Kaeya: So what if I know my ancestry? Do I strike you as the type who would be bound by that kind of thing?
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 34.ogg Kaeya: Relax. I'll be just as delighted to hunt down the Abyss Order tomorrow as I have always been.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 35.ogg Kaeya: Either way, looks like we're out of time. I've got a spice merchant to meet in a minute, so I'll leave the three of you to carry on the conversation without me.
Media:vo szaq201 4 kaeya 36.ogg Kaeya: See you 'round. And Dainsleif, no need to listen in from the sidelines next time we meet. Let me buy you a drink.
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Kaeya! You're really here! Paimon half thought you were playing some sort of prank on us...
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wait a second, you must be here on official business, right? What do you think you're doing, spending every afternoon drinking at the tavern? You itching for a lecture from Jean?
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: And how did that go?
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Yeah, that does sound like a great business opportunity. Guess Dawn Winery and Master Diluc are gonna make a tidy sum from this one too, huh?
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hey! Using your job to settle personal grievances isn't very knightly, Captain!
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: And? Do continue...
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: D—Dainsleif!?
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: What!?
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Kaeya... You're not involved with the Abyss Order in any way, are you...?
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Huh. Well, alright then... You go do your thing, Kaeya.
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: You don't really trust him, do you, Dain? You're both from Khaenri'ah, but you get on like oil and water...
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 12a.ogg Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 12b.ogg Paimon: Oh, so if (she/he) was the founder, (she/he)'d be the "(Queen/King)," right?
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Yeah, the Abyss Order's evil plan! We learned about that back in Mondstadt.
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 14a.ogg Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 14b.ogg Paimon: So you're going to the place that (she/he) mentioned back then?
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! Maybe we'll discover some secret that's lain hidden for hundreds of years!
Media:vo szaq201 4 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Seriously...?
Media:vo szaq201 6 dainslaif 01.ogg Dainsleif: Wait... This place, it's... familiar.
Media:vo szaq201 6 dainslaif 02.ogg Dainsleif: Yes. The forest has barely changed from how I remember it. There is very little human activity here, after all.
Media:vo szaq201 6 dainslaif 03.ogg Dainsleif: Let's search the area and see what we can find.
Media:vo szaq201 6 dainslaif 04.ogg Dainsleif: Nothing else stands out in this area. All that's left is that building. Come on.
Media:vo szaq201 6 dainslaif 05.ogg Dainsleif: Unlikely. There are no signs of life in this area. We should be able to enter without incident.
Media:vo szaq201 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What about it? It looks pretty normal to Paimon... Was it like this hundreds of years ago, too?
Media:vo szaq201 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Is this a field? It must belong to whoever owns that house over there...
Media:vo szaq201 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: But it looks like it's been abandoned for a long time. You could be forgiven for thinking nothing was ever grown here... Or wait, maybe nothing ever WAS grown here.
Media:vo szaq201 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: It's an extinguished bonfire. Forest Rangers, perhaps?
Media:vo szaq201 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Looks like it's been ages since it was last lit. And clearly they put it out carefully to prevent a forest fire, too. That's responsible.
Media:vo szaq201 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Wait, we're just gonna go barging in? What if someone's home?
Media:vo szaq201 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: If you say so... Well, uh... you lead the way then, Dain. Hehe...
Media:vo szaq201 7 dainslaif 01.ogg Dainsleif: Investigate carefully. We mustn't miss a single detail.
Media:vo szaq201 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh, so there really isn't anyone home... *cough* Ugh, this place is so dusty! Paimon bets no one's lived here in years!
