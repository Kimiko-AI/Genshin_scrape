 Amurta.
Ziryab: Exactly!
 Armuta.
Ziryab: Well, quite the opposite of the correct answer.
 Atamur.
Ziryab: Haha, unfortunately, that's not the answer.
 Divine Tree.
Ziryab: Haha, good, good! It's correct!
 Enormous Tree!
Ziryab: Well, as powerful as it sounds, it's wrong.
 Finger.
Ziryab: That's not even close... The answer should be "Fungi." Think of mushrooms when you're recalling the word.
 Fungee.
Ziryab: Actually, it's "Fungi." Think of mushrooms when you're recalling the word.
 Fungi.
Ziryab: Fungi it is. They resemble mushrooms, after all.
 Great Tree.
Ziryab: Haha, pretty concise. But unfortunately, it's wrong.
 Haravatat.
Ziryab: Haha, wrong answer. Haravatat researchers study language, semiotics and logic... Trust me, it's really complicated.
 I don't know much about the Akademiya...
Ziryab: Haha, it's okay. You'll at least know something about it after you answer my questions.
 I think I've done something like this before...
Paimon: You mean the time when Swan in Mondstadt asked you those questions?
Paimon: But he gave us the answers in advance! Paimon doesn't think this person would do that for us...
 Quest DescriptionSumeru researcher Ziryab seems interested in you...
 Rtawahist.
Ziryab: Well, unfortunately, you got it wrong. Rtawahist is the base camp of Illuminationism researchers whose research focus lies in the universe above us... Hehe, doesn't that sound appealing?
 Slumber Beast.
Ziryab: Actually, it's "Sumpter Beast." Hope you can recall it next time.
 Spantamad.
Ziryab: That's right. Spantamad, home to Elementalism researchers who see the Seven Great Elements as the essence of all matter and life.
 Summer Beast.
Ziryab: Actually, the name of the beast is "Sumpter Beast." Hope you can recall it next time.
 Sumpter Beast.
Ziryab: Sumpter Beast it is. What a memory!
 Wall of Milh.
Ziryab: Actually, it's "Wall of Samiel." Don't forget that.
 Wall of Samiel.
Ziryab: Good, good. You got it right!
 Wall of Simoom.
Ziryab: Actually, it's "Wall of Samiel." It's used to proof sand, not wind. Hope you can recall it next time.
 Who, me?
 You are looking for inspiration?
 You lost something?
 You ran out of materials?
Paimon: But he gave us the answers in advance! Paimon doesn't think this person would do that for us...
Paimon: You mean the time when Swan in Mondstadt asked you those questions?
Ziryab: (These questions are really not that challenging...)
Ziryab: Actually, it's "Fungi." Think of mushrooms when you're recalling the word.
Ziryab: Actually, it's "Sumpter Beast." Hope you can recall it next time.
Ziryab: Actually, it's "Wall of Samiel." Don't forget that.
Ziryab: Actually, it's "Wall of Samiel." It's used to proof sand, not wind. Hope you can recall it next time.
Ziryab: Actually, the name of the beast is "Sumpter Beast." Hope you can recall it next time.
Ziryab: Actually, there are a great number of Driyosh in one of the Darshans of the Akademiya.
Ziryab: Ahem, actually, I'm compiling a "Q&A" brochure to help the freshmen quickly grasp the various terms circulating in Sumeru.
Ziryab: Ahem... As you may know, each Darshan in the Akademiya has its own specialized focus on research.
Ziryab: But no, no. I didn't lose anything, nor did I lack research materials. As for inspiration... Well, I've found enough of it on my own.
Ziryab: Don't worry. They are not daunting questions, just some... ordinary little ones.
Ziryab: Exactly!
Ziryab: Fungi it is. They resemble mushrooms, after all.
Ziryab: Good, good. You got it right!
Ziryab: Haha, good, good! It's correct!
Ziryab: Haha, it's okay. You'll at least know something about it after you answer my questions.
Ziryab: Haha, pretty concise. But unfortunately, it's wrong.
Ziryab: Haha, unfortunately, that's not the answer.
Ziryab: Haha, wrong answer. Haravatat researchers study language, semiotics and logic... Trust me, it's really complicated.
Ziryab: Have you been outside the Sumeru City? There are some barriers around the desert.
Ziryab: Hehe, it's alright. It's quite normal for a new visitor in Sumeru to answer some of the questions wrong.
Ziryab: Hey! Traveler! Hold on a second.
Ziryab: Hmm... you didn't answer them all correctly.
Ziryab: However, I'm not sure about the difficulty of these questions... so I thought I could use your help with it.
Ziryab: I wonder if these questions are too difficult...
Ziryab: If you look up, can you see the tree holding up the Akademiya?
Ziryab: In a nutshell, it's to explain complicated nouns in the form of questions and answers.
Ziryab: Let's get started then. Here's the question.
Ziryab: Maybe you have come across some traveling researchers who call themselves Driyosh Traveling Scholars.
Ziryab: My next question is a simple one that many would easily ignore.
Ziryab: My question is: what's the name of the beast?
Ziryab: My question is: what's the name of the monster?
Ziryab: My question is: what's the name of this Darshan?
Ziryab: My question is: what's the name of those barriers?
Ziryab: Now listen, what's the name of the tree holding up the Akademiya?
Ziryab: Okay. That's all for my questions today. Let's see how many questions you answered correctly...
Ziryab: Please take these as a reward for all the work you've done.
Ziryab: Please take these as a thank-you for answering my questions.
Ziryab: So, what's the name of the Darshan with the largest number of researchers? I'll give you a hint â€” it's the school with Biology as its major focus.
Ziryab: Sumeru merchants often use a kind of beast to carry their goods when traveling long distances.
Ziryab: Sumpter Beast it is. What a memory!
Ziryab: That's not even close... The answer should be "Fungi." Think of mushrooms when you're recalling the word.
Ziryab: That's right. Spantamad, home to Elementalism researchers who see the Seven Great Elements as the essence of all matter and life.
Ziryab: There is... well... to put it simply, a mushroom-like monster in the wilderness of Sumeru.
Ziryab: This way, it'll be more efficient and interesting for students to learn.
Ziryab: Well done! You've got all three questions right. Looks like you've done your homework in Sumeru!
Ziryab: Well, as powerful as it sounds, it's wrong.
Ziryab: Well, quite the opposite of the correct answer.
Ziryab: Well, unfortunately, you got it wrong. Rtawahist is the base camp of Illuminationism researchers whose research focus lies in the universe above us... Hehe, doesn't that sound appealing?
Ziryab: What? ...Why did you sound so familiar with this? Ahaha!
Ziryab: With the elements as the core of its theory, this Darshan studies a full range of things closely tied with elemental powers.
Ziryab: Yep! Hehe, I would like to ask you a small favor.
