 Greetings.

 Hello.

 Of course.
 If we see them.
Aradashan: Oh, Nara (Traveler) is such a nice Nara. Aradashan thanks Nara (Traveler) from the bottom of Aradashan's heart!
Aradashan: Come see Aradashan once you've beaten all the Big Iron Chunks!
Aradashan: If you could beat all the Big Iron Chunks, you must also be able to...
Paimon: ?
Aradashan: Heh, Aradashan will save that for when Nara (Traveler) comes back!

 Only 16? We've dealt with it.
Aradashan: Oh! Nara (Traveler) and Paimon are so amazing! Now Aradashan knows why the air and ground in the forest have become cleaner.
Aradashan: Wait for Aradashan! Aradashan is going to get the friends!
Paimon: Friends?
(Dialogue continues to "Woah! So many Aranara appeared out of nowhere..." line below)

(Talk to Arasaha)

Arasaha: I don't speak to Nara often.
Arasaha: Thank you, nice Nara.
(Talk to Aradashan)

Aradashan: You're very powerful, Nara (Traveler). We'll defeat the Bulky Iron Chunk for sure!
(Talk to Arasata)

Arasata: It is said the Bulky Iron Chunk has many forms and can turn into many Big Iron Chunks.
Arasata: But it will be vulnerable once you beat any of its key parts, so watch carefully, Nara (Traveler).
(Talk to Arayuta)

Arayuta: Will we defeat the Bulky Iron Chunk? It is a terrible monster as told in the legends... Uhhh...

Aradashan: Hey, it is indeed you two, Nara (Traveler) and Paimon!
Paimon: Yeah, we beat all the monsters that were locked up by the stones!
Aradashan: Heh, Aradashan believed Nara (Traveler) and Paimon could do that for sure!
Aradashan: See, this is the Nara (Traveler) whom Aradashan mentioned.

Aradashan: You're very powerful, Nara (Traveler). We'll defeat the Bulky Iron Chunk for sure!

Arasaha: I don't speak to Nara often.
Arasaha: Thank you, nice Nara.

Arasata: It is said the Bulky Iron Chunk has many forms and can turn into many Big Iron Chunks.
Arasata: But it will be vulnerable once you beat any of its key parts, so watch carefully, Nara (Traveler).

Arayuta: Will we defeat the Bulky Iron Chunk? It is a terrible monster as told in the legends... Uhhh...

Paimon: Woah! So many Aranara appeared out of nowhere...
 Do you dream about fighting, Paimon?
Paimon: Paimon doesn't want to dream about fighting! Paimon only wants to dream about eating delicious food!
 Greetings.
 Have you really helped in any combat?
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon knows just where to hide!
 Hello.
 I know you'll get there.
 I'll be fine!
Arasaha: Okay. Be careful.
 I'll help.
 I'll need to make some preparations.
Aradashan: Ah, tell Aradashan when you are ready, Nara (Traveler)...
 I'll need to make some preparations.
Arasaha: Okay. I will wait.
 I'll need to make some preparations.
Arasata: Preparations are indeed needed before facing a mighty foe... Get ready before you start...
 I'll need to prepare first.
Arayuta: Okay... Tell me once you are ready!
 If we see them.
 It's not dangerous in dreams.
Paimon: True, it's their dream, after all. The Perpetual Mechanical Array won't be real and we won't get hurt.
 It's routine for us now.
 Let's do this.
Arasata: Please be careful.
 Let's go again.
Arasaha: Okay! Here it goes!
 Let's go for one more round!
Arayuta: So happy to see Nara (Traveler) fight again!
 Let's try again.
Arasata: Please be careful...
 Not now.
Aradashan: If Nara (Traveler) wants to challenge the Bulky Iron Chunk that has only one stack of Ararakalari lifted, just come to Aradashan...
 Not now.
Arasaha: Nara (Traveler) has completed the training. Very impressive!
 Not now.
Arasata: Do not hesitate to tell Arasata if you need anything...
 Not now.
Arayuta: Okay, tell me if you wish to try again!
 Of course.
 Only 16? We've dealt with it.
 Quest DescriptionAfter unlocking the stone lock in Sumeru, and defeating the monsters trapped in the seal, you will be entrusted by Aranara to defeat other sealed monsters.
 Step DescriptionAll sixteen ruins mechanisms sealed by "stone lock" have been eliminated. There may be some other "surprises" waiting in the cave where we met Aradashan.
 Step DescriptionHelp Aradashan defeat the "Bulky Iron Chunk" beneath the lake.
 Sure.
Aradashan: Then let's get started!
 Sure.
Aradashan: Well then, let's get started!
 Sure.
Arayuta: I'm sure you'll do fine, Nara (Traveler)!
 That would indeed be very dangerous.
 The consequences would be unimaginable.
 We did indeed break it...
 Whatever kind of iron chunk it is.
 Yeah, you can rest assured now.
???: Eh? The Golden Nara and the silver bird can see Aradashan?
???: Oh no, the stone lock is gone!
???: Who could have broken the lock? Could it be the Big Iron Chunk?
Aradashan: Ah, Nara (Traveler), want to try fighting the Bulky Iron Chunk in your dreams?
Aradashan: Ah, tell Aradashan when you are ready, Nara (Traveler)...
Aradashan: Aradashan didn't expect Nara (Traveler) to be so powerful. Uh, can Nara (Traveler) help...?
Aradashan: Aradashan will go train in dreams with Arasata, Arayuta, and Arasaha now!
Aradashan: Aradashan will not help you suppress the power of the Bulky Iron Chunk this time. But don't worry, Arasata, Arayuta, and Arasaha will still help. Want to try?
Aradashan: Bulky Iron Chunk is mightier than Big Iron Chunk. We could only contain it with our Ararakalari.
Aradashan: But Nara (Traveler) is powerful and can defeat the Big Iron Chunks. With Nara (Traveler)'s help, we can beat the mighty Bulky Iron Chunk!
Aradashan: But it would be bad if we should miss any loose locks, so Aradashan, Arasata, Arasaha, and Arayuta must become more powerful.
Aradashan: Come see Aradashan once you've beaten all the Big Iron Chunks!
Aradashan: Even if our Ararakalari could defeat Big Iron Chunks, we wouldn't be able to handle the Bulky Iron Chunk.
Aradashan: Heh, Aradashan believed Nara (Traveler) and Paimon could do that for sure!
Aradashan: Heh, Aradashan will save that for when Nara (Traveler) comes back!
Aradashan: Hehe, Nara (Traveler) beat the Bulky Iron Chunk without Aradashan's help. Amazing!
Aradashan: Hehe, yes, it is related to the stone locks.
Aradashan: Hey, it is indeed you two, Nara (Traveler) and Paimon!
Aradashan: Hmmm... You're a Golden Nara, with the same Golden hair as Nara Varuna, with the warm scent of a sun-kissed leaf...
Aradashan: If Nara (Traveler) hadn't been here...
Aradashan: If Nara (Traveler) wants to challenge the Bulky Iron Chunk that has only one stack of Ararakalari lifted, just come to Aradashan...
Aradashan: If we could defeat them with Ararakalari like Arabalika can, we wouldn't have to worry about the stone locks turning into Valuka.
Aradashan: If you could beat all the Big Iron Chunks, you must also be able to...
Aradashan: It's okay. We just need to lower the water level and make a passage!
Aradashan: Nara (Traveler) and Paimon, these are Arasata, Arasaha, and Arayuta.
Aradashan: No, so Nara (Traveler) was the one breaking the lock...? Aradashan thought the Big Iron Chunks escaped on their own!
Aradashan: Oh! Nara (Traveler) and Paimon are so amazing! Now Aradashan knows why the air and ground in the forest have become cleaner.
Aradashan: Oh, Nara (Traveler) is such a nice Nara!
Aradashan: Oh, Nara (Traveler) is such a nice Nara. Aradashan thanks Nara (Traveler) from the bottom of Aradashan's heart!
Aradashan: Oh, but now is not the time to make friends. The stone lock... Did you see who broke it, Nara (Traveler) and Paimon!?
Aradashan: Oh, it goes way, way back...
Aradashan: Okay, Aradashan gets it. It's Nara (Traveler) and Paimon. Aradashan's name is Aradashan.
Aradashan: Or does Nara (Traveler) want to challenge Bulky Iron Chunk with only one stack of Ararakalari lifted again?
Aradashan: Please wait a while, Nara (Traveler), and we'll see you in the lake.
Aradashan: Really? So the Big Iron Chunk was destroyed? Great news! Aradashan was about to shed leaves at the thought of them pouring out!
Aradashan: Release the Bulky Iron Chunk when you're ready!
Aradashan: See, this is the Nara (Traveler) whom Aradashan mentioned.
Aradashan: Several hundred cycles of trees ago, the iron monsters appeared. Some were big iron Nara, some were legless big iron Nara.
Aradashan: So Aradashan would like to ask Nara (Traveler) for another favor...
Aradashan: So Nara (Traveler) and Paimon took down the Big Iron Chunk here?
Aradashan: So smart, Paimon! Aradashan is somewhat a bit surprised...
Aradashan: So when Aradashan saw Nara (Traveler) defeat Big Iron Chunks, Aradashan thought Nara (Traveler) could defeat Bulky Chunk.
Aradashan: The monsters were as tall as mountains, spewing light as bright as fire. They made the forests weep and bushes wail in the howling fire.
Aradashan: The stone lock is gone! The Big Iron Chunk is coming out!
Aradashan: Then let's get started!
Aradashan: Then you can join and share our dream of the Bulky Iron Chunk.
Aradashan: There are sixteen stone locks in total in the forest with Big Iron Chunks inside... Can (Traveler) defeat them?
Aradashan: Time for Nara (Traveler) to challenge a stronger Bulky Iron Chunk. Aradashan is sure that Nara (Traveler) can do it...
Aradashan: Uh, we can't defeat the Big Iron Chunks right now, so if we released them from those stone locks just like that...
Aradashan: Wait for Aradashan! Aradashan is going to get the friends!
Aradashan: We must fight the imaginary Bulky Iron Chunk in our dream!
Aradashan: We need to lift the Ararakalari we cast on the Bulky Iron Chunk, layer by layer, and finally, fight it with all Ararakalari lifted...
Aradashan: We'll help you by using our Ararakalari, Nara (Traveler)!
Aradashan: Well then, let's get started!
Aradashan: When you want to, Nara (Traveler), just sing the Rhythm of the Great Dream like when you entered Vanarana.
Aradashan: Whoa, Aradashan didn't think that the Bulky Iron Chunk would still be so strong after we used Ararakalari.
Aradashan: Yes, let's meet again in the dream later!
Aradashan: Yes.
Aradashan: You should hide, Nara (Traveler) and Paimon! Big Iron Chunks are big and hard, some even shoot fire out of their eyes! Very dangerous!
Aradashan: You're very powerful, Nara (Traveler). We'll defeat the Bulky Iron Chunk for sure!
Arasaha: ...Arasaha.
Arasaha: ...Be careful.
Arasaha: ...Must rely on ourselves.
Arasaha: ...No.
Arasaha: ...You will not be forgotten.
Arasaha: But I will help Nara...
Arasaha: I don't speak to Nara often.
Arasaha: Impressive, Nara (Traveler).
Arasaha: Let Arasata lift the Ararakalari and make the Bulky Iron Chunk stronger...
Arasaha: Mmm... The Bulky Iron Chunk with all Ararakalari lifted... Do you wish to challenge it again?
Arasaha: Nara (Traveler) has completed the training. Very impressive!
Arasaha: Nara (Traveler)...
Arasaha: Nara, train? Then find Arayuta...
Arasaha: Okay! Here it goes!
Arasaha: Okay. Be careful.
Arasaha: Okay. I will wait.
Arasaha: Thank you, nice Nara.
Arasaha: Thank you.
Arasaha: The Bulky Iron Chunk not suppressed by any Ararakalari has been... defeated...
Arasaha: True strength lies within your own body...
Arasaha: We will not help you suppress the Bulky Iron Chunk. You will be on your own. Is that okay?
Arasata: Arasaha is right. Seeing Nara (Traveler) fighting the Bulky Iron Chunk had us in awe.
Arasata: As a sign of my gratitude, Nara (Traveler), I shall remember you with the first ray of dawn.
Arasata: But Aradashan, Arayuta, and I won't suppress the power of the Bulky Iron Chunk this time. Though it's in the dream, it is still super scary. Want to try?
Arasata: But a Bulky Iron Chunk with all Ararakalari lifted is still very scary...
Arasata: But it will be vulnerable once you beat any of its key parts, so watch carefully, Nara (Traveler).
Arasata: Do not hesitate to tell Arasata if you need anything...
Arasata: Hello... I am Arasata.
Arasata: If you are not ready, why not challenge a Bulky Iron Chunk with three stacks of Ararakalari lifted and hone your skills first...
Arasata: It is said the Bulky Iron Chunk has many forms and can turn into many Big Iron Chunks.
Arasata: Little strokes fell great oaks. Nara (Traveler), are you here to train as well...?
Arasata: Many a little makes a mickle... We challenge Bulky Iron Chunk step by step...
Arasata: Nara (Traveler) is so helpful, like the rain in a drought!
Arasata: Nara (Traveler) wants to train? Then ask Aradashan to help you get started...
Arasata: Nara (Traveler), you are like a rushing river... Don't stop. Go to Arayuta and challenge the stronger Bulky Iron Chunk.
Arasata: Nara (Traveler), you are like the wind that blows away mists and miasma. Even the strongest Bulky Iron Chunk will not stand a chance against you.
Arasata: Please be careful.
Arasata: Please be careful...
Arasata: Preparations are indeed needed before facing a mighty foe... Get ready before you start...
Arasata: Same as the stone locks. They crack and fracture until they become Valuka.
Arasata: The Bulky Iron Chunk can fly and crash down like a meteor. Be careful, Nara (Traveler).
Arasata: Then the Big Iron Chunks can shrug off the stone locks to bring doom to the forests. So, we must guard the locks.
Arasata: Want to challenge the Bulky Iron Chunk with three stacks of Ararakalari lifted again?
Arasata: Well... Aradasha locked the Big Iron Chunks away, but even the hardest earth erodes and crumbles in time...
Arayuta: Arayuta! My name is Arayuta!
Arayuta: Bulky Iron Chunk!
Arayuta: Come to Arayuta, Nara (Traveler), if you want to challenge the Bulky Iron Chunk with two stacks of Ararakalari lifted.
Arayuta: Do you wish to fight again?
Arayuta: I'm sure you'll do fine, Nara (Traveler)!
Arayuta: It's Nara (Traveler)! As you see, we are training to fight the Bulky Iron Chunk...
Arayuta: Just like that, the great Aradasha restored peace to much foliage, allowing Nara and Aranara to rest in the forest at night.
Arayuta: Let me tell the story from that point on. I like the rest part of the story.
Arayuta: Nara (Traveler) glows as bright as gold, just like Nara Varuna did in the tales!
Arayuta: Nara (Traveler) is awesome. If it's Nara (Traveler), even the mighty Bulky Iron Chunk from the legends can be defeated!
Arayuta: Nara (Traveler), is as great as Nara Varuna!
Arayuta: Nara (Traveler), you are as valiant as Nara Varuna in the stories!
Arayuta: Okay, tell me if you wish to try again!
Arayuta: Okay... Tell me once you are ready!
Arayuta: Paimon knows my name now. I'm so happy!
Arayuta: So happy to see Nara (Traveler) fight again!
Arayuta: So, Nara (Traveler), what do you say?
Arayuta: Strange. Why do you call the Bulky Iron Chunk "Perlulu Manacle Array"?
Arayuta: The great Aradasha defeated many, many Big Iron Chunks with Ararakalari and locked them up with stone locks.
Arayuta: There is still a long way to go before catching up with the great Aradasha.
Arayuta: This time, Aradashan and I won't help you suppress the power of Bulky Iron Chunk. It will be more like the Bulky Iron Chunk in the stories. Worry not, Arasata and Arasaha will still help you!
Arayuta: We must train harder, so we can be heroes like Aradasha in the next crisis!
Arayuta: We want to lift the Ararakalari on Bulky Iron Chunk and fight it as it grows stronger. If Nara (Traveler) wants to join, just tell Aradashan!
Arayuta: When things were at their most perilous, the great Aradasha emerged.
Arayuta: Will we defeat the Bulky Iron Chunk? It is a terrible monster as told in the legends... Uhhh...
Arayuta: Yeah, Aradasha was super powerful, taking on all those Big Iron Chunks like that! Aradasha stories are my favorites!
Paimon: Aradashan, you told us to come see you after we're done with all the Big Iron Chunks... What for?
Paimon: But if the Big Iron Chunks that Aradasha put away have been defeated by (Traveler), why did you want us to come here?
Paimon: But you said that the Bulky Iron Chunk is under a lake, right? So, how will we get there?
Paimon: Could it be related to the stone locks?
Paimon: Do you mean the monster trapped inside? We've dealt with it already.
Paimon: Friends?
Paimon: Go for it!
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon knows just where to hide!
Paimon: It's an Aranara...
Paimon: It's okay, since the Perpetual Mechanical Array... Uh, Bulky Iron Chunk is defeated, there will be no more iron monsters in the forests!
Paimon: Let's go find Ara... That Aranara.
Paimon: More Aranara names! Aradashan, Arasata, Arasaha, and...
Paimon: Oh, the name will fit pretty soon... But we'll stick to calling it Bulky Iron Chunk for now.
Paimon: Okay, Paimon's got it, Arayuta!
Paimon: Paimon doesn't want to dream about fighting! Paimon only wants to dream about eating delicious food!
Paimon: Paimon is not a silver bird! And gold... Well, this is (Traveler).
Paimon: Since the Big Iron Chunks are Ruin Graders, Ruin Drakes, and the likes... It's no surprise that the Bulky Iron Chunk was actually a Perpetual Mechanical Array...
Paimon: So this is the Bulky Iron Chunk.
Paimon: So you called us here to deal with the Bulky Iron Chunk?
Paimon: So you wanted to beat the Big Iron Chunks yourselves...
Paimon: So, all the Ruin Graders and Ruin Drakes and stuff from the stone locks we unlocked were defeated and confined by Aradasha!?
Paimon: Somehow that sounds more like a nightmare...
Paimon: The stone lock is probably what we just opened...
Paimon: True, it's their dream, after all. The Perpetual Mechanical Array won't be real and we won't get hurt.
Paimon: Uh... How did that become our problem?
Paimon: We've taken loads of monsters like them down in the past!
Paimon: What is there to be surprised about!?
Paimon: Woah! So many Aranara appeared out of nowhere...
Paimon: Yeah, we beat all the monsters that were locked up by the stones!
Paimon: Yeah? This seems to be the sixteenth! Now, the monsters sealed by the "stone lock" should all be defeated!
Paimon: You mean the Big Iron Chunks?
Paimon: ?
