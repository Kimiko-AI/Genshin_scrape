(Karkata looks curiously at Abattouy's body and tries to place a mechanical part onto his chest)
(The mechanical part rolls off. Karkata quickly picks it up and carefully places it over Abattouy's heart)
(Seeing no reaction, Karkata gathers all the mechanical parts it collected and piles them onto Abattouy's chest)
(Karkata nudges Abattouy's head a few times, but he does not wake)
(Karkata's core begins to spark and he curls up onto the floor)
(A mechanical part rolls off Abattouy's chest, stopping at Tighnari's feet. He picks it up)
(Paimon and the Traveler look at each other and back to Abattouy)
(Cinematic ends)
 "Junior researcher"?
 Abattouy's research...
 Banned research...
 He mentioned something about "power."
 I don't feel too well...
 I'm starting to get dizzy...
 I've never seen a machine like this before...
 It's not responding...
 Karkata...
 Quest DescriptionThe mechanical crab has stopped at a certain point. The source of the contamination seems to be within.
 Step DescriptionIt seems that the collapsed person was Karkata's creator, Abattouy. However, what was Karkata gathering all these mechanical components for?
 Step DescriptionKarkata could not "repair" its master, and it has also reached its limit...
 Step DescriptionSo it seems that the Ley Line effluence was man-made all along. You have to turn the Ley Line Extractor off.
 Step DescriptionYou see a silent person in the lab. What in the world happened here?
 Step DescriptionYou turned off the Ley Line device. It's time to go back and check on Karkata.
 Then, Karkata...
After inserting the tape, the projector gradually begins to display a recording of the past...
Lab Scene: (Before you lies a non-operational Karkata and a lifeless Abattouy.)
Media:vo dialog tnllq003 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Why are you still here?
Media:vo dialog tnllq003 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: I'll take care of this. Go and report to the Adventurers' Guild, and then get some rest.
Media:vo tnllq001 karkata doubt 01.ogg Karkata: Kulilu?
Media:vo tnllq001 karkata excite 01.ogg Mechanical Crab: Kalu! Kalu!
Media:vo tnllq001 karkata happy 01.ogg Karkata: Kolu!
Media:vo tnllq001 karkata happy 01.ogg Mechanical Crab: Kolu!
Media:vo tnllq001 karkata upset 01.ogg Karkata: Kuli...
Media:vo tnllq001 karkata upset 01.ogg Mechanical Crab: Kuli...
Media:vo tnllq003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It stopped here!
Media:vo tnllq003 1 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Upon closer inspection, the plants here are really different.
Media:vo tnllq003 1 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Ley Line energies are also stronger here. This may be the place we've been looking for.
Media:vo tnllq003 1 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Ready yourselves. We're going in.
Media:vo tnllq003 10 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: ...This should be the control unit.
Media:vo tnllq003 10 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Once we turn it off, the Ley Line Extractor should also shut down.
(The green crystal on the control unit stops glowing)
Media:vo tnllq003 10 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Without an external force damaging the Ley Lines, they should start to slowly repair themselves.
Media:vo tnllq003 10 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Oh, but I bet you two are more worried about Karkata. Let's head back.
Media:vo tnllq003 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So... Karkata has been collecting parts because it thinks doing so will "fix" its owner?
Media:vo tnllq003 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So that's why it kept stealing mechanical parts... But, it can't repair its owner, no matter how hard it tries.
Media:vo tnllq003 11 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Karkata? Karkata?
Media:vo tnllq003 11 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Can you hear Paimon? Tighnari says you're awesome!
Media:vo tnllq003 11 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Karkata is unable to understand the concept of "death."
Media:vo tnllq003 11 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: However, it probably remembers when Abattouy replaced its parts when it malfunctioned, and how that restored it to an operational state.
Media:vo tnllq003 11 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: It's true that Karkata isn't able to think or understand many topics, but it is like a small child that imitates what adults do.
Media:vo tnllq003 11 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Yes, but the important thing is that it formed the thought of "wanting to repair Abattouy."
Media:vo tnllq003 11 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: No one knows how this thought came to be, but it has even suppressed the "instincts" that Abattouy had installed.
Media:vo tnllq003 11 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: If it really is as we've predicted, this research truly will make waves in the Akademiya. It might've been possible to achieve this with ancient technology, but no one has been able to do the same with modern tools.
Media:vo tnllq003 11 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: It reached its limit. It hasn't recharged this entire time, nor has it replaced its severely damaged parts.
Media:vo tnllq003 11 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: It's a miracle that it managed to hang on for so long.
Media:vo tnllq003 11 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: I'm going to go confirm that the Ley Line Extractor has shut down. Come with me.
Media:vo tnllq003 11 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: Let them... be alone for a while.
Media:vo tnllq003 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What the heck!
Media:vo tnllq003 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: B—But...
Media:vo tnllq003 12 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Alright... Then, let's go back to Katheryne...
Media:vo tnllq003 12 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: The Ley Line Extractor has ceased operations.
Media:vo tnllq003 12 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Traces of Ley Line energy are still in the atmosphere, but the effluence's source has been stopped. The Purification Devices will handle the rest.
Media:vo tnllq003 12 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Moving on, those affected by the Ley Lines need immediate care. We'll put up an announcement on the bulletin board about the dangers of entering the contaminated region, and for symptomatic individuals to find Collei.
Media:vo tnllq003 12 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: According to the Akademiya's policies, we need to bring everything back.
Media:vo tnllq003 12 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: Research materials related to mechanical life forms will be destroyed, and Karkata will be disassembled and sealed away.
Media:vo tnllq003 12 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: You two should return first. I'll take care of things here.
Media:vo tnllq003 12 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: Although we've stopped the source of the effluence, the Ley Line energy in the air exceeds normal values. Your bodies won't be able to hold up if you continue to stay here.
Media:vo tnllq003 12 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Listen, (Traveler) hasn't rested very well, right?
Media:vo tnllq003 12 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: Also, it'll take some time to pack up all the research documents. You're not familiar with this research after all, so you won't be of much use here.
Media:vo tnllq003 12 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: Tell the Adventurers' Guild that the incident has been resolved, and then get some sleep. We can discuss matters tomorrow.
Media:vo tnllq003 12 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: Oh, and... Don't talk about Abattouy. The fewer that know about mechanical life form research, the better.
Media:vo tnllq003 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: There's a ton of mechanical monsters here! They made this place their lair!
Media:vo tnllq003 3 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Looks like there's no way to sneak by. Let's take care of them quickly.
Media:vo tnllq003 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What is this?
Media:vo tnllq003 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: That's terrible... We have to stop it!
Media:vo tnllq003 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Let Paimon see... Ugh, Paimon doesn't see controls anywhere!
Media:vo tnllq003 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: But... You're also vulnerable to the Ley Lines, right?
Media:vo tnllq003 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: We're staying. We can't leave you here by yourself!
Media:vo tnllq003 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: You know where it is? Hey, wait for us!
Media:vo tnllq003 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: What's this...? It'll only show up if you step on it?
Media:vo tnllq003 4 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Ley Line energy is spilling out from here.
Media:vo tnllq003 4 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: This device... It's extracting energy from the Ley Lines without end.
Media:vo tnllq003 4 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Who in the world would do this without considering the consequences? The Ley Lines won't be able to repair themselves if their flow is perpetually disrupted like this.
Media:vo tnllq003 4 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Standing here is equivalent to being directly showered in Ley Line energy, which may cause irreversible damage to your body.
Media:vo tnllq003 4 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: (Traveler), take Paimon and get out of here. I'll see if I can find a way to turn this thing off.
Media:vo tnllq003 4 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: Then let's look for it together. If there is no control unit here, then there must be a "trapdoor" somewhere—
Media:vo tnllq003 4 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: Be careful, and watch your step.
Media:vo tnllq003 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wooow! It's huge in here!
Media:vo tnllq003 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Look! Someone's here!
Media:vo tnllq003 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Are you the one that's taking the Ley Lines' energy? Turn off that machine now!
Media:vo tnllq003 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Why aren't you saying anything? Too ashamed?
Media:vo tnllq003 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: What is it doing?
Media:vo tnllq003 5 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: This place is a natural hiding spot with how hidden it is.
Media:vo tnllq003 5 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: The pipes continue further. Let's head in.
Media:vo tnllq003 5 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: ...His body is cold.
Media:vo tnllq003 5 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: It's emaciated, and his eyes are sunken, likely from chronic malnourishment and stress. He collapsed and never got back up. What exactly happened here?
Media:vo tnllq003 5 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: ...Almost forgot about you. Here, this is the last one.
Media:vo tnllq003 5 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: I'm not sure. Judging by this room's layout, this place was a laboratory. We should find a repository of research documents if we keep going.
Media:vo tnllq003 5 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: The file room will definitely give us some clues, so let's go take a look. Maybe we can piece together what happened here.
Media:vo tnllq003 6 abattouy 01.ogg ???: Karkata? Karkata? Seriously, I look away for one second and you're gone?
Media:vo tnllq003 6 abattouy 02.ogg ???: There you are! Look here — this is our new home!
Media:vo tnllq003 6 abattouy 03.ogg Abattouy: I, Abattouy, will unleash my talents here and amaze those ancient fossils at the Akademiya!
Media:vo tnllq003 6 abattouy 04.ogg Abattouy: Oh? You're also quite happy! Karkata, do you know what we're about to do?
Media:vo tnllq003 6 abattouy 05.ogg Abattouy: Hahaha... Yes, I thought not.
Media:vo tnllq003 6 abattouy 06.ogg Abattouy: Listen up, Karkata. I'm going to make a mechanical life form that can be mass-produced. The technology will be unlike anything else that exists.
Media:vo tnllq003 6 abattouy 07.ogg Abattouy: I'll use mechanical organs, and electric currents will course through them like blood. A steel-cast heart that will beat forever, and a brain of myriad components that can think like mine.
Media:vo tnllq003 6 abattouy 08.ogg Abattouy: Inspiration from the ruins, and the research that the Akademiya had banned... I hope everything can start anew from this place.
Media:vo tnllq003 6 abattouy 09.ogg Abattouy: When you can understand our language and live among us, you will no longer be a boring machine, but a truly living being!
Media:vo tnllq003 6 abattouy 10.ogg Abattouy: It's fine. You will understand. One day, you will understand me...
Media:vo tnllq003 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Did you two find anything?
Media:vo tnllq003 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Tape recording?
Media:vo tnllq003 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: C'mon, let's watch it!
Media:vo tnllq003 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Karkata is the mechanical crab, right?
Media:vo tnllq003 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: And that researcher named Abattouy said he wanted to prove something to the Akademiya?
Media:vo tnllq003 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: "Junior researcher"?
Media:vo tnllq003 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Nothing, Paimon was just wondering... Doesn't Abattouy look older than you?
Media:vo tnllq003 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Ohhh!
Media:vo tnllq003 6 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: There are a lot of lab notes, but it would take way too long to read through them all. I found a tape recording used for an experiment, and based on its serial number, it's from two years ago.
Media:vo tnllq003 6 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Yes. The Spantamad created a device that visually records experiments and consolidates the final production into a tape.
Media:vo tnllq003 6 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: However, these devices are expensive to make and aren't entirely stable. That's why they are only used in some laboratories and do not see wider usage.
Media:vo tnllq003 6 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Hold on, let me figure out how to play the tape. Okay, this should do it.
Media:vo tnllq003 6 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: I remember now. I had a junior researcher named Abattouy. He was expelled from the Akademiya for researching mechanical life forms.
Media:vo tnllq003 6 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: Yeah, what's wrong?
Media:vo tnllq003 6 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: He is, but academic progression isn't tied to age. I finished my studies a while ago, so subsequent students generally considered me as their senior.
Media:vo tnllq003 6 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Of course, age can be an issue. For a while, people always dragged me into pictures. I felt like some kind of animal on display...
Media:vo tnllq003 6 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: Ahem, that isn't important. Let's go and see if we can find other tape recordings.
Media:vo tnllq003 7 abattouy 01.ogg Abattouy: It's rare that you malfunction because of an operational error.
Media:vo tnllq003 7 abattouy 02.ogg Abattouy: Seems that making coffee is still somewhat difficult for you. Or is there an issue with my set parameters?
Media:vo tnllq003 7 abattouy 03.ogg Abattouy: Alright, there you go.
Media:vo tnllq003 7 abattouy 04.ogg Abattouy: Water entered the chela and caused it to short-circuit, so it couldn't receive signals from the ganglion...
Media:vo tnllq003 7 abattouy 05.ogg Abattouy: Look at me, talking to you like this. You can't understand me anyway, can you? It's fine. I swapped in some new parts, so you should be alright now.
Media:vo tnllq003 7 abattouy 06.ogg Abattouy: Try moving around. Everything in working order?
Media:vo tnllq003 7 abattouy 07.ogg Abattouy: Be more careful next time! We're tight on money right now, so we don't have a lot of parts or power to spare.
Media:vo tnllq003 7 abattouy 08.ogg Abattouy: I'm glad. Karkata, did you know? Yesterday, I dreamed that you could talk.
Media:vo tnllq003 7 abattouy 09.ogg Abattouy: Aren't the bunch at the Akademiya always saying things like "mechanical intelligence is just an extension of statistics"? They were blown away when they saw us talking with each other.
Media:vo tnllq003 7 abattouy 10.ogg Abattouy: Too bad it was just a dream. Forget holding a conversation with me — you're so simple that you probably wouldn't even notice if I died.
Media:vo tnllq003 7 abattouy 11.ogg Abattouy: Never mind, I should probably be worrying about next month's power...
Media:vo tnllq003 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Look, look! Paimon found another tape!
Media:vo tnllq003 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: A date is written on it! Let Paimon see... It's from half a year ago!
Media:vo tnllq003 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Paimon doesn't feel like he's a bad person. He even changed out Karkata's broken parts. Why would he mess with Ley Lines?
Media:vo tnllq003 7 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: That's quite the time gap. I wonder what happened in between...
Media:vo tnllq003 7 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: After Abattouy left the Akademiya, everyone lost contact with him.
Media:vo tnllq003 7 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: I thought he was so despondent that he gave up on researching mechanical life forms. Instead, he had holed up here and continued his experiments.
Media:vo tnllq003 7 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Let's keep looking around.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 01.ogg Abattouy: Sorry, Karkata. I was just thinking about something. Today might become a special day.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 02.ogg Abattouy: In my recent experiments, I successfully gave you a living being's "instincts."
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 03.ogg Abattouy: When you're low on power or if one of your parts is damaged, you will prioritize your "survival" command and proactively recharge or replace your parts.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 04.ogg Abattouy: That is a very dangerous thing. And today, I did something even more dangerous.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 05.ogg Abattouy: I've officially activated the third generation Ley Line Extractor. The Ley Lines will serve as our power source from now on.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 06.ogg Abattouy: Conducting research on mechanical life forms requires a large amount of power. Even if I scrimped and saved, the Mora I have wouldn't last for long.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 07.ogg Abattouy: I'm also getting tired, Karkata. I don't know what's driving me to continue with this research anymore.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 08.ogg Abattouy: They say that even if it simulates the operation of a living creature's organs, a machine is still an ice-cold tool. I want to prove them wrong. I want to turn you into a living, breathing, and talking being...
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 09.ogg Abattouy: I'm not talking about anything cheerful, Karkata.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 10.ogg Abattouy: Modules for language, emotion, and movement... I've been working my absolute hardest to augment and refine your functionalities, but I've never seen an effective response.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 11.ogg Abattouy: You are my finest success, but even you can't understand me. All you can do is execute limited responses based on preset commands or keywords.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 12.ogg Abattouy: Karkata, I wish you could speak to me, even just once...
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 13.ogg Abattouy: *sigh* Yes. You cannot understand me, so you cannot answer me, either.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 14.ogg Abattouy: It is what it is. In a few days, I'll sell the failed Ley Line Extractor for some Mora and continue my experiments. Life goes on, and I have to as well — I don't have any other choice.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 15.ogg Abattouy: This is new.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 16.ogg Abattouy: If I place another two control modules here to simulate the brain's thalamus...
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 17.ogg Abattouy: Agh... Of course my heart decides to act up now. Why did I cut medication from our expenses...? Karkata? Come help me— *cough*
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 18.ogg Abattouy: Strange... I feel weak...
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 19.ogg Abattouy: Oh no, I have to shut down the extractor...
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 20.ogg Abattouy: Shut them off... *cough* *cough* If we let them recharge indefinitely... they'll... go out of control...
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 21.ogg Abattouy: Right... I never input a command to shut down the extractor, so you don't understand what I'm saying...
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 22.ogg Abattouy: In the end, it's just like the Akademiya said: Mechanical life forms only bring danger. My research... Was there any point to it at all?
Media:vo tnllq003 8 abattouy 23.ogg Abattouy: I'm sorry, Karkata... In the end, I still wasn't able to turn you... into a true mechanical life form...
Media:vo tnllq003 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Maybe Karkata helped him with sorting?
Media:vo tnllq003 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon understands, then why didn't Karkata go haywire like the other machines?
Media:vo tnllq003 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What does that mean?
Media:vo tnllq003 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: It's even more complicated than before. Looks like this place won't let us pass so easily.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: The way ends here. Hmm... Wanna try jumping down?
Media:vo tnllq003 8 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Following the serial numbers, the next recording should be here.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: The writing is sloppy. Perhaps his state of mind had changed.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: There's also an undated tape in the wrong spot. It doesn't seem like Abattouy put it there.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: It's hard to say. These are the last two tape recordings. Let's watch them.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: I see, so the Ley Line effluence was an accident.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: After Abattouy's unexpected death, the mechanical monsters were driven by their "instincts" and continuously drew out power from the Ley Line Extractor. This eventually resulted in severe damage to the Ley Lines.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: Because Karkata is different from the other machines.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Structures similar to a living organism's, the ability to cry and laugh, and capacity for independent thought... To Abattouy, only a machine with these features could be considered a mechanical life form.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: Perhaps only by building such a machine could he have the Akademiya acknowledge his protracted research.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: But if he had slowed down and saw Karkata as a friend instead of as an experimental product, he would have noticed.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: Karkata can't speak, and yet it cares about Abattouy far more than it does about itself.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 tighnari 12.ogg Tighnari: You'll see in a bit. But before that, we have a more urgent task at hand.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 tighnari 13.ogg Tighnari: First, let's find the control unit for the Ley Line Extractor and shut it down.
Media:vo tnllq003 8 tighnari 14.ogg Tighnari: More of this transparent flooring. It feels like a maze...
Media:vo tnllq003 8 tighnari 15.ogg Tighnari: Below us is the final room. The control unit is likely in there.
Observe Karkata: (Karkata stands in front of the machine, as if thinking about something.)
Observe Mechanical Crab: (The mechanical crab stands in front of the machine, as if thinking about something.)
The last recording ends here.
The recording ends here.
The recording ends here. Tighnari quietly inserts the next tape.
Tighnari marks out Pardis Dhyai on the map. He usually goes there when doing research.
