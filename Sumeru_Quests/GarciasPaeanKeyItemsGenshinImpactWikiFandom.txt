Garcia: Lutong, my dear Lutong, are you sure... this is the place?
Lutong: Yes, Mr. Garcia, this is where Slimes are most often found.
Garcia: I am most certain of that. However...
Garcia: Would you agree that the Slimes are mildly overwhelming in quantity?
Lutong: Mr. Garcia, this is how we end up when we are caught short financially.
 You are... Garcia?
 What brings you here?
Garcia: Traveler! What a coincidence!
 What are you doing here?
Garcia: Haha. Why, I'm here for...
Lutong: Trouble.
Garcia: Valiant adventure! Please, Lutong, could you not...
Lutong: As you wish, sir.
Garcia: In truth, I'm here to look for Slime Condensate to use as the lubricant for my Numbering Machine.
Garcia: Unfortunately, most of the Slime Condensate on sale is of low quality as it's kept for too long. Besides...
Lutong: Mr. Garcia purchased too many books...
Garcia: Oh come now, those were... necessary expenditures — that left us short of Mora, yes, but still!
Garcia: That's why we came here, to collect some fresh Slime Condensate ourselves.
Garcia: But as you can see, though our good Lutong is from Liyue, he knows neither martial arts nor culinary skills.
Lutong: Fortunately, I have a gift for accounting... all thanks to the complex tax rules of the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Garcia: ...As for me, I can't possibly hit anyone with the components of my Numbering Machine.
 Do you need my help?
Garcia: Well, in a sense...
Lutong: Yes.
Garcia: Lutong, do we... um... do we have any Mora left?
Lutong: Well, I believe we'll find a way to get by after we pay the Traveler.
Garcia: Splendid. Traveler, I'd appreciate it if you could kindly retrieve some Slime Condensate for me.

Lutong: Once again, Mr. Garcia, I sincerely suggest that we sell a few books to raise some Mora.
Garcia: No! Not for the world! Lutong, my dear, you are asking me to put my soul up for sale!
Lutong: But sir, no one bids for souls.
 Why are you still here?
 Do you need some more Slime Condensate?
Garcia: Oh, Traveler? What brings you here?
Garcia: Um... My last experiment failed. There was something wrong with my dilution of the Slime Condensate...
Garcia: Instead of lubricating the bearings of the Numbering Machine, the lubricant actually made them more likely to get stuck.
Garcia: As such, I need more Slime Condensate for further experiments. Could you...
 Leave it to me.
 Don't you have a way to earn Mora?
Garcia: It's not that we don't...
Lutong: It's a question of ability.
Garcia: Thank you very much for this timely explanation, my dear Lutong.
Garcia: Well, it's most certainly a shame... Although I have finished building the Numbering Machine, its functions are incalculably underwhelming.
Garcia: It cannot even fully function as an automatic calculator, requiring manual aid to facilitate its operation.
Garcia: But... I will enhance it! I firmly believe that my Numbering Machine will be a great invention!
Garcia: An... An invention that heralds a new era! And after that, I'm sure I'll find a way to earn Mora...
Garcia: H—However, before that...
Lutong: Traveler, please help us collect the Slime Condensate. I'll have your payment ready.

 Got it right here.
 Leave it to me.
 Quest DescriptionGarcia and Lutong seem to be troubled by something...
 What are you doing here?
 What brings you here?
 Why are you still here?
 You are... Garcia?
Garcia: (I need to speed up my research...)
Garcia: ...As for me, I can't possibly hit anyone with the components of my Numbering Machine.
Garcia: Aha! That's a clever metaphor. Then I suppose our situation is not quite so dire.
Garcia: An... An invention that heralds a new era! And after that, I'm sure I'll find a way to earn Mora...
Garcia: As such, I need more Slime Condensate for further experiments. Could you...
Garcia: But as you can see, though our good Lutong is from Liyue, he knows neither martial arts nor culinary skills.
Garcia: But... I will enhance it! I firmly believe that my Numbering Machine will be a great invention!
Garcia: Eh? Come on now, Lutong, don't jinx it...
Garcia: Haha. Why, I'm here for...
Garcia: H—However, before that...
Garcia: I am most certain of that. However...
Garcia: I must attend to my research now. Lutong, please take care of the remaining affairs.
Garcia: In truth, I'm here to look for Slime Condensate to use as the lubricant for my Numbering Machine.
Garcia: Instead of lubricating the bearings of the Numbering Machine, the lubricant actually made them more likely to get stuck.
Garcia: It cannot even fully function as an automatic calculator, requiring manual aid to facilitate its operation.
Garcia: It's not that we don't...
Garcia: Lutong, do we... um... do we have any Mora left?
Garcia: Lutong, my dear Lutong, are you sure... this is the place?
Garcia: Lutong, our Mora...
Garcia: No! Not for the world! Lutong, my dear, you are asking me to put my soul up for sale!
Garcia: Oh come now, those were... necessary expenditures — that left us short of Mora, yes, but still!
Garcia: Oh, Traveler? What brings you here?
Garcia: Splendid. Traveler, I'd appreciate it if you could kindly retrieve some Slime Condensate for me.
Garcia: Thank you very much for this timely explanation, my dear Lutong.
Garcia: That's why we came here, to collect some fresh Slime Condensate ourselves.
Garcia: Traveler! What a coincidence!
Garcia: Traveler, have you obtained the Slime Condensate?
Garcia: Um... My last experiment failed. There was something wrong with my dilution of the Slime Condensate...
Garcia: Unfortunately, most of the Slime Condensate on sale is of low quality as it's kept for too long. Besides...
Garcia: Valiant adventure! Please, Lutong, could you not...
Garcia: Well, in a sense...
Garcia: Well, it's most certainly a shame... Although I have finished building the Numbering Machine, its functions are incalculably underwhelming.
Garcia: Wonderful! This should suffice. I'll continue my experiments once I return. With this as the lubricant, my Numbering Machine will definitely...
Garcia: Would you agree that the Slimes are mildly overwhelming in quantity?
Lutong: (Why does Mr. Garcia look like he's in a hurry...?)
Lutong: *sigh* ...Actually, I came to travel with Mr. Garcia because I didn't want to spend my whole life doing accounts in a department of the Ministry of Civil Affairs like my parents do.
Lutong: And um... in my humble opinion, we might be in need of your help in the future.
Lutong: As you wish, sir.
Lutong: But now... in addition to working with Mr. Garcia on his calculations, I also need to help him sort out his accounts...
Lutong: But sir, no one bids for souls.
Lutong: Fortunately, I have a gift for accounting... all thanks to the complex tax rules of the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Lutong: Here's your payment, Traveler. Thank you ever so much for your help.
Lutong: I guess this is what they call destiny...
Lutong: It means that when a mountain stand in our way, we will always find a way to get over it.
Lutong: It's a question of ability.
Lutong: Mr. Garcia purchased too many books...
Lutong: Mr. Garcia, this is how we end up when we are caught short financially.
Lutong: Once again, Mr. Garcia, I sincerely suggest that we sell a few books to raise some Mora.
Lutong: Rest assured. As long as the accounts are in my hands, you will be paid fairly.
Lutong: Still, Mr. Gracia, do you think the person who originally penned those words found a way across the mountain?
Lutong: There is an old saying in Liyue, "When your path is blocked by a mountain, there will be a way through." I think this  describes precisely where we are right now.
Lutong: Traveler, please help us collect the Slime Condensate. I'll have your payment ready.
Lutong: Trouble.
Lutong: We'll get by, Mr. Garcia.
Lutong: Well, I believe we'll find a way to get by after we pay the Traveler.
Lutong: Yes, Mr. Garcia, this is where Slimes are most often found.
Lutong: Yes, sir.
Lutong: Yes.
Paimon: That should be enough. Let's get back to Mr. Garcia now.
