Media:vo cnlq003 1 nabil 02.ogg Nabil: How's the investigation going?

Media:vo cnlq003 2 nabil 01.ogg Nabil: Hello, we meet again.
Media:vo cnlq003 2 nabil 02.ogg Nabil: Have you managed to find Cyno? If so, how's he doing?

Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 01.ogg Nabil: We meet again! Thank you so much for all your help!
Media:vo cnlq003 26 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Nabil, what are you doing here?
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 02.ogg Nabil: Convicts from the desert are being escorted through Caravan Ribat, so I'm here to keep an eye on things. This should be the last group of them, so I'll be heading back to the Akademiya once they're cleared.
 What's the situation?
 What's happened these last few days?
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 03.ogg Nabil: The last few days have been quite the ride, but fortunately, I can say with confidence that this case is finally coming to an end.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 04.ogg Nabil: At first, the mercenary groups on the list were putting up quite a fight. They made several desperate attempts to cover up the truth. However, word is that someone crossed the desert and took out their main camp overnight.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 05.ogg Nabil: After that, people on the list started to put pressure on the higher ups within the Akademiya. Everyone was on edge and the case came to a standstill.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: And? Then what happened?
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 06.ogg Nabil: Well, then we received word that Taj Radkani had sacrificed himself on the case. The news really stirred up the members of our ranks.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 07.ogg Nabil: The matra then moved together against the enemy. We cleared out the traitors from within the Akademiya and arrested all the researchers on the list.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 08.ogg Nabil: Some of them managed to get out of the Akademiya, but still failed to escape. The scattered criminals were captured all across Sumeru by the mysterious person who had defeated the mercenary groups.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 09.ogg Nabil: I even heard that someone was about to escape to Fontaine but was still apprehended just at the border. Having more than 300 prisoners apprehended for interrogation has definitely shaken things up recently.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So that's the end of it! Catching everyone on the list means no more smuggling Canned Knowledge and no more victims!
Media:vo cnlq003 26 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: It was a lot of work, but Paimon thinks we accomplished something big!
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 10.ogg Nabil: That's right. Thanks again for your assistance.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 11.ogg Nabil: As for the mysterious person who hit the mercenary camp... that must be Cyno, right? He's the only one I can think of who could accomplish such a feat.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 12.ogg Nabil: Speaking of which, have you been in touch with Cyno these days? I think I just saw him when I was on watch nearby.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 13.ogg Nabil: He was walking with someone I didn't recognize, and then before I knew it, they were nowhere to be seen. If you happen to see him, please send my regards.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Sure thing, Nabil! You be careful too. Don't let any of those bad guys escape!
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 14.ogg Nabil: Don't worry about me. If anything happens, you can find me at the Akademiya anytime! Farewell then.

Media:vo cnlq003 27 nabil 01.ogg Nabil: We meet again! Thank you so much for all your help!
Media:vo cnlq003 27 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Nabil, what are you doing here?

Media:vo cnlq003 27 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Is Cyno alright? He didn't get injured, did he?
Media:vo cnlq003 27 nabil 10.ogg Nabil: He seems fine, but nobody knows the real situation.
Media:vo cnlq003 27 nabil 11.ogg Nabil: He brought over 300 suspects to judgment all on his own. Among them were even some of our former colleagues... Not just the criminals are afraid of him — even we start feeling a little nervous when he's around now.
Media:vo cnlq003 27 nabil 12.ogg Nabil: But even if we start feeling all self-conscious thinking if we've done anything wrong... We're still always honored to have Cyno around.
Media:vo cnlq003 27 nabil 13.ogg Nabil: By the way, are you guys here to see Cyno? I think I just saw him walking in that direction when I was on watch nearby.
Media:vo cnlq003 27 nabil 14.ogg Nabil: He was walking with someone I didn't recognize, and then before I knew it, they were nowhere to be seen. If you happen to see him, please send my regards.

Sealed Materials: Court of Desolation
Despite repeated prohibitions, research on the Court of Desolation in the past decade has increased without ceasing.
Researchers who study the history of the Court of Desolation mainly go through three stages: Discovery, Investigation, and Fanaticism.
The earliest stage of research is the relatively basic "Discovery" phase, which causes little to no harm. The results of their discoveries will show that treasures related to life and death may be hidden within the Court of Desolation. This is also where the rumor of "bringing the dead back to life" may begin.
Following the initial phase is a prolonged "Investigation" phase. All documentation regarding the location of the Court of Desolation has been vague at best. As a result, the structure itself has never been truly discovered.
Many researchers deplete their resources searching in the desert, only to find a scant few remaining stone tablets with the words "Entering the Court of Desolation comes at the price of one's life."
Two different interpretations of the line have quickly emerged as a result. Some believe that "the price of one's life" is the key to entering the Court of Desolation, while others asserted that it was a requirement for the Court to appear. Because the Court of Desolation has never been discovered, the latter view gradually became mainstream.
As a result, many researchers went in a short period of time. Overtaken by their fervent desire to make the Court of Desolation appear, they attempted to sacrifice their lives. Relevant research became increasingly dangerous and was eventually banned.
But even after that, many Akademiya scholars secretly continued their research. It was not until seven scholars — including Murtada Radkani — were arrested that research into the Court of Desolation entered a period of stagnation once again...
 "To open the Court of Desolation, one must sacrifice their life"...
 All thanks to Cyno.
 Disappeared.
 Do you also know Cyno, Utayba?
 Even so, he won't back down.
 Forbidden research...
 He means...
 He seemed pretty okay.
 He's the same as always.
 I hope it will make you happy, Cyno.
 Is there any way we could meet Murtada?
 Just calm down, everyone.
 Let's go ask around somewhere else.
 Let's go to his home and have a look.
 Maybe he is aware of that.
 Murtada Radkani...
 Quest DescriptionIt seems that even a Matra is involved in the Canned Knowledge smuggling. Cyno decided to let you take the secret letter back to the Akademiya and enter the Restricted Repository to procure information.
 Sounds like a lot of work.
 Step DescriptionClues to the Court of Desolation and a suspicious list were found from Taj's home. Although you don't know why Taj keeps such important information at home, you decide to go back and meet Cyno first.
 Step DescriptionCyno decides to go to the Court of Desolation and ask Taj to get it straight.
 Step DescriptionIt's about time. Go to Caravan Ribat and have a look.
 Step DescriptionTaj was destroyed together with the Court of Desolation and fulfilled his final wish. Cyno took the list he left behind and decided to complete the arrest alone. You agreed to meet at Caravan Ribat in four days.
 Step DescriptionThe clue points to Cyno's former partner, Taj, but Nabil doesn't believe it. You decide to go to the gate of the Akademiya to look for more information.
 Step DescriptionThe words of the guard proved that Taj is indeed suspicious, and Nabil decides to search Taj's home.
 Step DescriptionYou have learned from Nabil what happened in the last four days. Now go and see Cyno.
 Taj has gone through Murtada's research files?
 The damage on the walls we saw on our way here...
 The evidence is stacked against him now.
 There's no other option, though.
 This researcher's name sounds familiar...
 We have to do this in order to clear his name.
 What about the organization...?
 What's happened these last few days?
 What's the situation?
 You said Taj comes to the repository?
 You're going to destroy the Court of Desolation.
As a result, many researchers went in a short period of time. Overtaken by their fervent desire to make the Court of Desolation appear, they attempted to sacrifice their lives. Relevant research became increasingly dangerous and was eventually banned.
But even after that, many Akademiya scholars secretly continued their research. It was not until seven scholars — including Murtada Radkani — were arrested that research into the Court of Desolation entered a period of stagnation once again...
Cutscene's Travel Log summary:
Quicksand keeps pouring in. The Court of Desolation is about to be engulfed by the desert. In the last moments of his life, Taj is caught up in memories of his son... Because of him, Murtada had been carefully scrutinized ever since he was a child; When the boy was young, they had the worst relationship possible; And when he went to arrest Murtada, his son begged him to make an exception...On the other end, you and Cyno are running desperately for "life," whereas behind you, the elderly Matra Taj Radkani, who is ready to face "death," utters his last words:Because... We are Matra.
(The entire Court of Desolation begins to shake and fall apart)
(Taj moves to sit on the ground, while the Traveler, Paimon, and Cyno frantically looks around)
(The Traveler, Paimon and Cyno turn back to the entrance and start to escape, while Taj sits calmly on the ground and starts to reminisce)
Murtada Radkani (child, voice only): Dad
Murtada Radkani (child, voice only): Why are they so strict with me?
Murtada Radkani (child, voice only): I'm always the only one
Murtada Radkani (child, voice only): Who gets in trouble...
(The Court of Desolation continues to collapse. Taj watches calmly as sand pours in from every opening to fill the halls)
Murtada Radkani (young man, voice only): Just leave me alone!
Murtada Radkani (young man, voice only): Don't worry
Murtada Radkani (young man, voice only): I won't damage your precious reputation!
(Sand starts engulfing Taj as well, as he continues to reminisce)
Murtada Radkani (adult, voice only): Alright, Dad
Murtada Radkani (adult, voice only): Let's start over
(The Traveler, Paimon, and Cyno keep running for their lives, while sand rushes close behind them)
Murtada Radkani (adult, voice only): By the way, I've finally found an area of research I wish to pursue
(Cyno grabs the Traveler's hand while running and rushes forward, with Paimon flying close behind)
Murtada Radkani (adult, voice only): Why can't you show even a little leniency?
(Cyno suddenly notices an opening with light entering from above, then jumps with the Traveler, while Paimon maneuvers her flight in zig-zag right behind them)
Murtada Radkani (adult, voice only): Why...?
(Taj, now engulfed in sand up to his torso and still quickly being buried, looks at the ceiling and utters his last words)
Taj Radkani: Because...
Taj Radkani: We are Matra
(Sand pours in, completely burying Taj and the rest of the Court of Desolation)

Media:Vo cnlq003 1 nabil 01.ogg Nabil: Hello, we meet again.
Media:Vo cnlq003 1 nabil 04.ogg Nabil: I read the letter, and must admit that I hadn't expected things to be so serious... Sorry, had I known it would be so dangerous, I never would have gotten you two involved.
Media:Vo cnlq003 1 nabil 05.ogg Nabil: Haha, I can tell that he really trusts you. The research files stored away in the Restricted Repository are far from ordinary. Everything there is essentially about dangerous research that's forbidden by the Akademiya.
Media:Vo cnlq003 1 nabil 06.ogg Nabil: Even I don't usually have authorization to enter, but with this letter from Cyno, it shouldn't be a problem.
Media:Vo cnlq003 1 nabil 07.ogg Nabil: That's right. Granted, the Akademiya is very supportive when it comes to research. They encourage scholars to conduct all kinds of studies.
Media:Vo cnlq003 1 nabil 08.ogg Nabil: However, some forms of research have proven to be so dangerous that the matra have to step in and put a stop to them. Normally, after some particular research becomes prohibited, the majority of the related files will be destroyed.
Media:Vo cnlq003 1 nabil 09.ogg Nabil: But some information may be retained as a record to warn later researchers. Such information is kept in the Restricted Repository, which is heavily guarded.
Media:Vo cnlq003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's alright, we wanted to help Cyno, too.
Media:Vo cnlq003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: The Restricted Repository... Uh, sounds kinda dangerous. We'd better keep an eye out.
Media:vo cnlq003 1 nabil 02.ogg Nabil: How's the investigation going?
Media:vo cnlq003 1 nabil 03.ogg Nabil: Oh, so you were able to find Cyno, after all! I hope he's doing alright.
Media:vo cnlq003 1 nabil 03.ogg Nabil: Oh, so you were able to find Cyno, after all! I hope he's doing alright.

Media:vo cnlq003 11 badr 01.ogg Badr: Huh? Well, yes, but isn't that pretty normal?
Media:vo cnlq003 11 badr 02.ogg Badr: The Akademiya consumes so many resources each day, everything from cooking ingredients, raw materials, even equipment for experiments... It's normal for goods to be coming in and out.
Media:vo cnlq003 11 badr 03.ogg Badr: That I'm not too sure of... I normally wouldn't notice whether the goods have any seals or not. Maybe you should ask someone else.
Media:vo cnlq003 11 nabil 01.ogg Nabil: Excuse me, have you seen any large shipments of goods leaving the Akademiya recently?
Media:vo cnlq003 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Right, but we're looking for shipments with a matra seal. Have you seen any like that?
Media:vo cnlq003 13 nabil 01.ogg Nabil: Excuse me, have you seen any large shipments of goods leaving the Akademiya recently?
Media:vo cnlq003 13 nabil 02.ogg Nabil: I'm just checking to ensure nothing unusual has happened.
Media:vo cnlq003 13 nabil 03.ogg Nabil: And you didn't find that suspicious? Why didn't you report it for inspection?
Media:vo cnlq003 13 nabil 04.ogg Nabil: Impossible. There must be some sort of mistake. There's no way Taj would ever...
Media:vo cnlq003 13 nabil 05.ogg Nabil: No, I won't believe it! Taj is an honorable man. Someone must be trying to frame him!
Media:vo cnlq003 13 nabil 06.ogg Nabil: Wait, I know another matra who works with Taj. I can ask him to let us speak with Taj!
Media:vo cnlq003 13 nabil 07.ogg Nabil: N—No way... Taj is just like Cyno — they are considered heroes among the matra! There is no way that he would...
Media:vo cnlq003 13 nabil 08.ogg Nabil: Fine. Looks like there's no other choice...
Media:vo cnlq003 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: A group of Eremites... Could Taj really be the one making all the Canned Knowledge?
Media:vo cnlq003 13 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hey, don't let it get to ya just yet! We'll get to the bottom of this, once and for all!
Media:vo cnlq003 13 payam 01.ogg Payam: Huh? Why do you ask?
Media:vo cnlq003 13 payam 02.ogg Payam: Well, I can't say it's unusual, but I did notice something.
Media:vo cnlq003 13 payam 03.ogg Payam: There's a Kshahrewar researcher who has been making frequent shipments recently. Dozens of large boxes each time, if not more.
Media:vo cnlq003 13 payam 04.ogg Payam: When I asked him about it, he said they just contained a bunch of old, worn-out machines. The Kshahrewar used to often sell scrap machines to traveling merchants, so I didn't really think anything of it.
Media:vo cnlq003 13 payam 05.ogg Payam: But he's been making a lot of shipments lately... There weren't ever so many outdated machines before.
Media:vo cnlq003 13 payam 06.ogg Payam: Well, the boxes were stamped with a matra seal. Why should I bother?
Media:vo cnlq003 13 payam 07.ogg Payam: Of course, I did start to wonder about the seal once, thinking that maybe they forged it or something, but you know what happened?
Media:vo cnlq003 13 payam 08.ogg Payam: A man named Taj came here and told me that he had already inspected the goods personally, and ordered me to leave the researcher alone. I couldn't question his word, could I?
Media:vo cnlq003 13 usem 01.ogg Usem: *sigh* As I've already told you, I don't have any way to contact Taj.
Media:vo cnlq003 13 usem 02.ogg Usem: A few Eremites showed up looking for Taj yesterday, and he met with them in his office. I was standing outside of the door, and I vaguely heard them say, "found it."
Media:vo cnlq003 13 usem 03.ogg Usem: Before I realized it, the door opened and Taj left with the group of them. I noticed that he had also changed into Eremite attire.
Media:vo cnlq003 13 usem 04.ogg Usem: But Taj didn't come to work today, so I've also started to feel a little concerned about the whole thing. If you'd like to speak with him, maybe you can try visiting his home. He lives just on the outskirts of Sumeru City.
Media:vo cnlq003 16 nabil 01.ogg Nabil: So this is Taj's place... Hmm, there doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Media:vo cnlq003 16 nabil 02.ogg Nabil: No, no... Wait, the door is unlocked! Did Taj leave in a hurry?
Media:vo cnlq003 16 nabil 03.ogg Nabil: Well anyway, we're still not sure if he's the real culprit. Probably not a good idea to go in without permission...
Media:vo cnlq003 16 nabil 04.ogg Nabil: *sigh* You're right. Even if we apply for a warrant now, we won't be able to do anything until tomorrow at the earliest. This is an emergency. I just hope Taj doesn't mind.
Media:vo cnlq003 16 nabil 05.ogg Nabil: What's this...?
Media:vo cnlq003 16 nabil 06.ogg Nabil: Hmm, yes, this is definitely Taj's handwriting. These papers look like records...
Media:vo cnlq003 16 nabil 07.ogg Nabil: These are transactions between Taj and some other people. From the look of the numbers, the scale of this smuggling case is absolutely massive.
Media:vo cnlq003 16 nabil 08.ogg Nabil: The whole operation involves more than 300 people, including dozens of celebrities! These are famous scholars, merchants, mercenaries...
Media:vo cnlq003 16 nabil 09.ogg Nabil: I have a feeling that Cyno might be unaware of what he's up against. There's no way anyone could face such a large organization on their own!
Media:vo cnlq003 16 nabil 10.ogg Nabil: You're right, that's just who he is.
Media:vo cnlq003 16 nabil 11.ogg Nabil: As for the map, it appears to indicate the location of the Court of Desolation. Let's take it to Cyno and let him decide how to proceed.

Media:vo cnlq003 16 nabil 12.ogg Nabil: If Taj really has turned on his honor and committed these terrible acts... then I suspect that he might already be at the Court of Desolation as we speak.
Media:vo cnlq003 16 nabil 13.ogg Nabil: I don't wanna suspect him, but I also don't know him very well. Maybe Cyno will know what to do.
Media:vo cnlq003 16 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Well, what should we do then? Do we break in?
Media:vo cnlq003 16 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's a paper full of names written on it. Oh, and a map... Nabil, can you make any sense of this?
Media:vo cnlq003 16 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Alright, we'll give these to Cyno and see! Let's go!

Media:vo cnlq003 17 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Hmm, Taj... It's been a while since I last saw him.
Media:vo cnlq003 17 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: From what I remember, he is a straitlaced man. Although he would resort to extreme measures from time to time, he would never do anything against his beliefs.
Media:vo cnlq003 17 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: I'm still not sure.
Media:vo cnlq003 17 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: I cannot imagine how devastating the incident with Murtada was for him, nor can I deny the possibility that people can change.
Media:vo cnlq003 17 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Whether it's out of love for his son or for other reasons, we have to see for ourselves to judge him, or rather, the person he's become.
Media:vo cnlq003 17 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: That's right. It's clear that he had a hand in this case, yet he made no report of it. There's no doubting that.
Media:vo cnlq003 17 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: That's also why I need to see him. I must ask his reasoning and judge him myself.
Media:vo cnlq003 17 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: Time is ticking. Let's go.
Media:vo cnlq003 17 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Well, Cyno, what do you make of it?
Media:vo cnlq003 17 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So do you think he's the one behind all this?

Media:vo cnlq003 18 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So this is the Court of Desolation. Are there really any treasures buried here?
Media:vo cnlq003 18 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ooh, Paimon's kinda nervous... Could it be dangerous?
Media:vo cnlq003 19 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Look, these walls have definitely seen better days... Was there some sort of battle here?
Media:vo cnlq003 19 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's keep going and see what we can find.
Media:vo cnlq003 2 nabil 01.ogg Nabil: Hello, we meet again.

Media:vo cnlq003 2 nabil 05.ogg Nabil: Even I don't usually have authorization to enter, but with this letter from Cyno, it shouldn't be a problem.
 Forbidden research...
Media:vo cnlq003 2 nabil 06.ogg Nabil: That's right. Granted, the Akademiya is very supportive when it comes to research. They encourage scholars to conduct all kinds of studies.
Media:vo cnlq003 2 nabil 07.ogg Nabil: However, some forms of research have proven to be so dangerous that the matra have to step in and put a stop to them. Normally, after some particular research becomes prohibited, the majority of the related files will be destroyed.
Media:vo cnlq003 2 nabil 08.ogg Nabil: But some information may be retained as a record to warn later researchers. Such information is kept in the Restricted Repository, which is heavily guarded.
Media:vo cnlq003 2 nabil 09.ogg Nabil: Follow me, I'll show you. Hopefully, we'll find the answers that Cyno's looking for.
Media:vo cnlq003 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: The Restricted Repository... Uh, sounds kinda dangerous. We'd better keep an eye out.

Media:vo cnlq003 20 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa... Is it just Paimon, or did that passageway just rotate?
Media:vo cnlq003 20 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's not gonna start moving again, is it? Uh, either way, we should be careful!
Media:vo cnlq003 21 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: A passage! Hopefully that's our way in!
Media:vo cnlq003 22 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh, that eye seems to be staring right at us!
Media:vo cnlq003 22 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Waah, this place gives Paimon the creeps. You go first...
Media:vo cnlq003 23 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Taj...
Media:vo cnlq003 23 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: That's right, this case is nearly closed, but the most important answer still eludes me.
Media:vo cnlq003 23 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: Was it all your doing? Smuggling the Canned Knowledge, the research of the Court of Desolation...
Media:vo cnlq003 23 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: Then explain why.
Media:vo cnlq003 23 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: I find that hard to believe.
Media:vo cnlq003 23 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo cnlq003 23 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: So, did you already find what you needed here?
Media:vo cnlq003 23 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: Enough conjecture. What has happened is already part of the past. You cannot bring the dead back to life.
Media:vo cnlq003 23 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: In the end, the treasures you seek are nothing but myths and legend.
Media:vo cnlq003 23 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: No. I sense danger behind that door. There will be dire consequences the moment you open it.
Media:vo cnlq003 23 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: I don't overthink things. If there is only one way for me to defend my principles, then that is the path I will take.
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 01.ogg Taj Radkani: Ah, Cyno, it's been some time since I've seen you last. I trust you are doing well?
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 02.ogg Taj Radkani: Seeing that you've made it all the way here, you must be on the cusp of wrapping up your investigation, I presume? Hmm, even faster than I expected. Is it because you have some new partners now?
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 03.ogg Taj Radkani: Yes, it was me.
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 04.ogg Taj Radkani: That's the difficult part. Let's just say I've changed... I've become a selfish coward who only wants to pursue his own interests.
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 05.ogg Taj Radkani: Oh, really? The way I see it, every person will end up like me sooner or later.
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 06.ogg Taj Radkani: When you're young, you press forward, unattached, living solely for the justice in your heart. But as you begin to age, you start to become more cautious. You know many things are wrong, but still turn a blind eye to them.
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 07.ogg Taj Radkani: I was the same. I never questioned my actions until Murtada died. I could feel the justice that I once strived to uphold slowly crumbling in my heart.
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 08.ogg Taj Radkani: I was completely dedicated to all that I did, but as I grew older, I found myself feeling alone... miserable. Can you imagine what it feels like to not have the will to live, but not be able to die?
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 09.ogg Taj Radkani: Murtada was sent to prison by my own hands, I set myself on this painful path. My son hated me till the day he died, and now I must live with that pain and regret.
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 10.ogg Taj Radkani: I failed him as a father, but now... Now, I have a chance to make it right, a chance to reunite with him...
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 11.ogg Taj Radkani: The Court of Desolation! Here lies the key to overcoming life and death — the power to even bring the dead back to life!
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 12.ogg Taj Radkani: Hehe... See this door behind me? Behind it lie the treasures that I seek.
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 13.ogg Taj Radkani: I'm so close, Cyno. If only you hadn't arrived now, I could already have...
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 14.ogg Taj Radkani: Since you're so sure, why don't you just let me open the door and see then?
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 15.ogg Taj Radkani: I beg you: As an old partner, can you let me fulfill my last wish? Just this once?
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 16.ogg Taj Radkani: Surely you get it by now. Doing your job without mercy will only drive people away from you. I'm the prime example.
Media:vo cnlq003 23 tajradkani 17.ogg Taj Radkani: Seems there's no convincing you... Alright then, let's see if your polearm skills have improved at all.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Your strength...
Media:vo cnlq003 24 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: I won't let you open that door.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: I'll do what I have to.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: You haven't changed either. You left that list of names and map in your house on purpose, didn't you? You wanted me to be able to find you here.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: All of this was just part of the act you were putting on. What happened just now was also part of your plan... You might have fooled those on the list, but you will not fool me.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: I had my suspicions from the beginning, but I couldn't be sure until we fought. If you really had changed, your fighting style wouldn't be as it was before.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: He never planned on opening the door. His true intention was...
Media:vo cnlq003 24 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: No wonder banning the research wasn't enough. A full-scale operation was already in motion.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: So you pretended to be the one behind all this as a test for me?
Media:vo cnlq003 24 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: His fate is already sealed. There is no life left inside him. He is like a candle with no more wick to burn.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: You planned it all from the very beginning, didn't you?
Media:vo cnlq003 24 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: Risking being treated as a traitor to collaborate with them, sacrificing your own life to open and destroy the Court of Desolation...
Media:vo cnlq003 24 cyno 13.ogg Cyno: There's nothing to be sorry for. We are partners.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 cyno 14.ogg Cyno: If you see Murtada... send him my greetings. Goodbye, old friend.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh oh, we have to stop this guy!
Media:vo cnlq003 24 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? What do you mean, Cyno?
Media:vo cnlq003 24 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ahh! What's happening?
Media:vo cnlq003 24 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wait, aren't you leaving, too? There are still loads of bad guys to catch outside!
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 01.ogg Taj Radkani: You feel it, don't you? I'm stronger than you remember. I gained new power when I entered the Court of Desolation.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 02.ogg Taj Radkani: This is only a taste of it. Once I open the door behind me, this power will be complete. Even life and death will have no grip on me!
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 03.ogg Taj Radkani: I wouldn't be so sure. I'm afraid it won't be too easy to stop me now that you're injured. Or are you ready to sacrifice your life for this?
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 04.ogg Taj Radkani: ...
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 05.ogg Taj Radkani: I still remember when we first became partners. You were always charging forward and putting your life on the line, just like now.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 06.ogg Taj Radkani: Even after all this time, you still haven't changed.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 07.ogg Taj Radkani: Seems our time is running short. Let me make this quick then.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 08.ogg Taj Radkani: After Murtada died, my spirit was crushed. For a long time, I was hoping this reality was just some terrible nightmare. I hoped that I would just wake up and be able to see his smiling face again.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 09.ogg Taj Radkani: That is when I was approached by someone who wished to collaborate and find the Court of Desolation together. I did some investigation of my own and discovered that they were part of a massive organization.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 10.ogg Taj Radkani: People from every walk of life are involved. They are relentless in their search, pouring countless Mora into secret research, even sacrificing lives in hopes that the Court of Desolation would appear.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 11.ogg Taj Radkani: I'm a flesh-and-blood human like anyone else, so I obviously hesitated and considered it... The thought of bringing my son back tugged at my heart. But in the end, I came to my senses. I knew that I could not let myself go down that path.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 12.ogg Taj Radkani: I suddenly came to a realization amidst my suffering... The Court of Desolation, a place that once drove people to tragedy, was still doing so even centuries later.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 13.ogg Taj Radkani: As long as this place exists, people will recklessly seek it out just as Murtada did, generation after generation, regardless of the cost...
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 14.ogg Taj Radkani: Let it be buried beneath the sand forever. Once the Court of Desolation is gone, there will no longer be anyone obsessed with seeking it out.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 15.ogg Taj Radkani: That's right. I acted as if I had abandoned my convictions just so that they would cooperate without raising any suspicion. This was the only way I could find and destroy this place.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 16.ogg Taj Radkani: But that wasn't enough. I needed someone I could trust to bring the organization to justice. The Akademiya forbids the researches [sic] of the Court of Desolation, so they would never approve of my plan in the first place.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 17.ogg Taj Radkani: To add to the problem, the organization is so powerful that they even have members working within the Akademiya. If I wished to destroy the organization, I couldn't just count on the Akademiya alone.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 18.ogg Taj Radkani: Yes, I'm sorry, but now I am assured. You haven't changed at all. You are still as you always were, fearless and making no compromise.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 19.ogg Taj Radkani: Anyway, this place is collapsing. You must leave now.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 20.ogg Taj Radkani: Regardless, I made a grave mistake by allowing the smuggling and the research of this place. Let this be the final judgment on myself.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 21.ogg Taj Radkani: I was always so busy with work that I never made time to fulfill Murtada's wishes.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 22.ogg Taj Radkani: Finding this place was his biggest wish. Since I'll be reuniting with him here... I can only hope he won't have anything more to hold against me.
Media:vo cnlq003 24 tajradkani 23.ogg Taj Radkani: I'll leave all those people on the list to you. Sorry for all the trouble I've caused.
Media:vo cnlq003 25 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Just as Taj said, that place had caused too many disasters and tragedies.
Media:vo cnlq003 25 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: Being buried in quicksand is its rightful end.
Media:vo cnlq003 25 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: To them, as long as there's Mora to be made, they will disregard the Akademiya's rules, whether it's the Court of Desolation or anything else.
Media:vo cnlq003 25 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: Their only goal is to make massive profits off of dangerous research. Taj may have set them back with the Court of Desolation, but it won't be long before they continue searching for another target.
Media:vo cnlq003 25 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: That's an opportunity that I will not let them have.
Media:vo cnlq003 25 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: Thank you, but you've already done enough.
Media:vo cnlq003 25 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: Just leave the rest to me. I will bring them to justice myself. Besides, I promised you that I would sweep away any potential danger.
Media:vo cnlq003 25 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: So that's what I'm going to do. Wait for me at Caravan Ribat four days from now.
Media:vo cnlq003 25 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? The Court of Desolation has...
Media:vo cnlq003 25 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We'll help, too!
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 01.ogg Nabil: We meet again! Thank you so much for all your help!
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 02.ogg Nabil: Convicts from the desert are being escorted through Caravan Ribat, so I'm here to keep an eye on things. This should be the last group of them, so I'll be heading back to the Akademiya once they're cleared.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 03.ogg Nabil: The last few days have been quite the ride, but fortunately, I can say with confidence that this case is finally coming to an end.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 04.ogg Nabil: At first, the mercenary groups on the list were putting up quite a fight. They made several desperate attempts to cover up the truth. However, word is that someone crossed the desert and took out their main camp overnight.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 05.ogg Nabil: After that, people on the list started to put pressure on the higher ups within the Akademiya. Everyone was on edge and the case came to a standstill.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 06.ogg Nabil: Well, then we received word that Taj Radkani had sacrificed himself on the case. The news really stirred up the members of our ranks.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 07.ogg Nabil: The matra then moved together against the enemy. We cleared out the traitors from within the Akademiya and arrested all the researchers on the list.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 08.ogg Nabil: Some of them managed to get out of the Akademiya, but still failed to escape. The scattered criminals were captured all across Sumeru by the mysterious person who had defeated the mercenary groups.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 09.ogg Nabil: I even heard that someone was about to escape to Fontaine but was still apprehended just at the border. Having more than 300 prisoners apprehended for interrogation has definitely shaken things up recently.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 10.ogg Nabil: That's right. Thanks again for your assistance.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 11.ogg Nabil: As for the mysterious person who hit the mercenary camp... that must be Cyno, right? He's the only one I can think of who could accomplish such a feat.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 12.ogg Nabil: Speaking of which, have you been in touch with Cyno these days? I think I just saw him when I was on watch nearby.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 13.ogg Nabil: He was walking with someone I didn't recognize, and then before I knew it, they were nowhere to be seen. If you happen to see him, please send my regards.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 nabil 14.ogg Nabil: Don't worry about me. If anything happens, you can find me at the Akademiya anytime! Farewell then.
Media:vo cnlq003 26 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Nabil, what are you doing here?
Media:vo cnlq003 26 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: And? Then what happened?
Media:vo cnlq003 26 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So that's the end of it! Catching everyone on the list means no more smuggling Canned Knowledge and no more victims!
Media:vo cnlq003 26 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: It was a lot of work, but Paimon thinks we accomplished something big!
Media:vo cnlq003 26 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Sure thing, Nabil! You be careful too. Don't let any of those bad guys escape!
Media:vo cnlq003 27 nabil 01.ogg Nabil: We meet again! Thank you so much for all your help!
Media:vo cnlq003 27 nabil 02.ogg Nabil: Convicts from the desert are being escorted through Caravan Ribat, so I'm here to keep an eye on things. This should be the last group of them, so I'll be heading back to the Akademiya once they're cleared.
Media:vo cnlq003 27 nabil 03.ogg Nabil: The last few days have been quite the ride, but fortunately, I can say with confidence that this case is finally coming to an end.

Media:vo cnlq003 27 nabil 10.ogg Nabil: He seems fine, but nobody knows the real situation.
Media:vo cnlq003 27 nabil 11.ogg Nabil: He brought over 300 suspects to judgment all on his own. Among them were even some of our former colleagues... Not just the criminals are afraid of him — even we start feeling a little nervous when he's around now.
Media:vo cnlq003 27 nabil 12.ogg Nabil: But even if we start feeling all self-conscious thinking if we've done anything wrong... We're still always honored to have Cyno around.
Media:vo cnlq003 27 nabil 13.ogg Nabil: By the way, are you guys here to see Cyno? I think I just saw him walking in that direction when I was on watch nearby.
Media:vo cnlq003 27 nabil 14.ogg Nabil: He was walking with someone I didn't recognize, and then before I knew it, they were nowhere to be seen. If you happen to see him, please send my regards.
Media:vo cnlq003 27 nabil 15.ogg Nabil: Don't worry about me. If anything happens, you can find me at the Akademiya anytime! Farewell then.
Media:vo cnlq003 27 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Nabil, what are you doing here?
Media:vo cnlq003 27 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: And? Then what happened?
Media:vo cnlq003 27 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Is Cyno alright? He didn't get injured, did he?
Media:vo cnlq003 27 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Sure thing, Nabil! You be careful too. Don't let any of those bad guys escape!
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: I'm aware.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: However, I learned something unexpected during interrogation... Apparently, someone had enticed Murtada Radkani into becoming interested in researching the Court of Desolation.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: Murtada had lived in his father's shadow all his life. Naturally, he wanted to conduct research that would seem ground-breaking and significant.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: After Murtada died, the organization tried to use Taj's shame regarding his son to add him to their ranks.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Toying with others' minds, treating lives like dirt, and doing anything for their own interests... This makes me angry.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: How is Collei these days?
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: I will.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: I've already caught those who were preparing to attack you in secret.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: Even if some criminals did slip through our fingers, they wouldn't know that you were involved in the case, so you can relax.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: It's still not time for me to rest yet. Those who died have fulfilled their wishes, but those who are alive must continue pressing forward.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: I've been thinking about what Taj said in the Court of Desolation these last few days. His words were not empty... People do change, and no belief can completely resist the erosion of time.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: I just hope my own change will come slowly, so that I can press on a little further...
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 13.ogg Cyno: That way, those who see me as their superior and those who are following in my footsteps will learn courage from my example.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 14.ogg Cyno: Just as I gained courage from my own superiors and my partner.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 15.ogg Cyno: I'll be fine. I'm also enjoying my chat with you right now, you know.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 16.ogg Cyno: There are many things I feel better about once I start to talk about them.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 17.ogg Cyno: Many people want to go to the desert to offer condolences for Taj, but I didn't share details with anyone... I'd prefer to avoid revealing the location of the Court of Desolation.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 cyno 18.ogg Cyno: One day, I'll gather some flowers that grow in arid desert conditions, and then I was hoping you'd join me in planting them on the remains of the Court of Desolation.
(Quest ends)
Media:vo cnlq003 28 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Cyno, Tighnari!
Media:vo cnlq003 28 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, so Tighnari must be who Nabil saw earlier! Are you also here to see Cyno?
Media:vo cnlq003 28 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh? You mean Collei is leaving Avidya Forest? What happened?
Media:vo cnlq003 28 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: But what about you, Cyno?
Media:vo cnlq003 28 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Trying to single-handedly bring 300 people to justice must feel pretty exhilarating. But I can assure you this is certainly not the best solution.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Fine, I understand. This is a type of trap I've been working on which uses plants. Here, take some just in case you need them next time.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: If thrown into the mud, the trap will grow rapidly and disperse a pollen that has a paralyzing effect. I don't have much use for the traps these days, but maybe you will, and can help me collect more testing data.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: That's right. Cyno asked me to collect some medicinal herbs to treat a girl named Simin.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: I also dropped by just to check for any injuries. He seems to be fine physically, but he looks a little more lonely than I remember.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: And Cyno, relax! You don't always have to look so serious, you know. Why don't you play more Genius Invokation TCG? Collei has always been a little wary of you, and your stern expression certainly isn't helping.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: She has grown a bit taller, but her grades could use some improvement. She still made many mistakes on her last test, even after I had marked all the important content in the book for her.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Her condition seems to be improving lately, so I plan on having her go outside more. It just so happens that I have something she can help me with...
Media:vo cnlq003 28 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: After some time, I plan on having her go outside more. It just so happens that I have something she can help me with...
Media:vo cnlq003 28 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: I've asked her to host some ad hoc lectures to teach the dangers of Canned Knowledge, as well as how to use it safely.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: Although we've apprehended all the criminals behind the recent smuggling case, there are many people who are still curious and seek after Canned Knowledge.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 tighnari 12.ogg Tighnari: So I decided to ask her to work on increasing knowledge and awareness on the topic. Please be sure to keep an eye on her.
Media:vo cnlq003 28 tighnari 13.ogg Tighnari: If anything else happens, the three of you can find me in the Avidya Forest. Take care.
(Tighnari leaves)
Media:vo cnlq003 3 nabil 01.ogg Nabil: Huh, so this is the Restricted Repository... I never thought I'd see the inside of it. This is a first for both you and me.
Media:vo cnlq003 3 utayba 01.ogg Utayba: Okay, I understand.
Media:vo cnlq003 3 utayba 02.ogg Utayba: Since Cyno is vouching for you, I suppose we can trust you. You may browse the information regarding the Court of Desolation. Ask me if you have any questions.
Media:vo cnlq003 3 utayba 03.ogg Utayba: But I'd suggest avoiding any other research files. Sometimes the less you know, the better.
Media:vo cnlq003 3 utayba 04.ogg Utayba: There are many who do not openly converse with others within the Akademiya, but even so, there are very few who I feel could be trusted with a real secret. Cyno happens to be one of them.
Media:vo cnlq003 3 utayba 05.ogg Utayba: Even though he's no longer in the Akademiya, I still trust him, and that goes for anyone he trusts as well.
Media:vo cnlq003 3 utayba 06.ogg Utayba: The files are over there. Just make it quick.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 nabil 01.ogg Nabil: What? Taj's son went to prison for researching the Court of Desolation!?
Media:vo cnlq003 5 nabil 02.ogg Nabil: It's just that... they arrested him in secret, so it was never publicly known. All I knew was that Taj's son was taken to prison. It's not just me, I bet even Cyno didn't know about it.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 nabil 03.ogg Nabil: Ah, right, I heard Cyno mention that before. But one day, Taj suddenly decided to retire from active duty and transferred to an administrative position.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 nabil 04.ogg Nabil: I wonder if it had anything to do with the Murtada incident?
Media:vo cnlq003 5 nabil 05.ogg Nabil: I had no idea that happened. That must be really hard for Taj. I've never heard him mention that to anyone...
Media:vo cnlq003 5 nabil 06.ogg Nabil: Wait, don't tell me you're starting to suspect Taj now!
Media:vo cnlq003 5 nabil 07.ogg Nabil: Impossible. Taj would never do that. I mean, yes, he does have a big reputation and has access to such research...
Media:vo cnlq003 5 nabil 08.ogg Nabil: But this is Taj we're talking about. He would never do anything against regulations. Never!
Media:vo cnlq003 5 nabil 09.ogg Nabil: But even so...
Media:vo cnlq003 5 nabil 10.ogg Nabil: Oh! Now that I think about it, Cyno suspected that the Canned Knowledge was coming from within the Akademiya, right?
Media:vo cnlq003 5 nabil 11.ogg Nabil: There's no way so many boxes could ever get through without drawing any attention. Maybe we could try asking people around the gate of the Akademiya and see what we can find.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 nabil 12.ogg Nabil: Don't worry, Taj. I won't let your reputation be tarnished!
Media:vo cnlq003 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa, there's a lot to read here... (Traveler), have you found anything yet?
Media:vo cnlq003 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh, it reminds Paimon of Cyno's former partner!
Media:vo cnlq003 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Why do you sound so surprised? You're a matra, aren't you?
Media:vo cnlq003 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Aww, that's awful, Paimon feels terrible now... Are you okay, (Traveler)?
Media:vo cnlq003 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Uh, Paimon's kinda confused... (Traveler), what should we do from here?
Media:vo cnlq003 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Alrighty then, let's go ask around!
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 01.ogg Utayba: His former partner? That would be Taj Radkani. But you're not far off — Murtada Radkani was Taj's only son.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 02.ogg Utayba: No, unfortunately, there isn't... He took his own life not long after he went to prison.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 03.ogg Utayba: You've heard about Taj right? I know Nabil has — every matra knows him.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 04.ogg Utayba: I would say he's probably pushing 50 this year, which makes him one of the most experienced matra. He is a man of integrity and honesty, and has made countless achievements. His reputation goes back a long way now.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 05.ogg Utayba: He used to be Cyno's only partner. Taj is also skilled with a polearm, so the two of them used to practice together when they weren't out on a mission.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 06.ogg Utayba: Taj was already very well-known by the time Murtada was born.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 07.ogg Utayba: So when Murtada came to study at the Akademiya, everyone had high expectations of him. He had to face a lot of pressure.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 08.ogg Utayba: Then he had an unpleasant dispute with his father, but they were eventually able to work things out. Not long after they had reconciled, Murtada was caught studying the Court of Desolation, which is in violation of Akademiya rules.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 09.ogg Utayba: Taj arrested his son and put him behind bars. He begged for leniency, but Taj wouldn't agree.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 10.ogg Utayba: Shortly after, Murtada slit his own throat with the pieces of a broken bowl... By the time Taj arrived at the scene, it was already too late. He never had a last chance to see his son.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 11.ogg Utayba: Since then, Taj has been periodically coming to the repository. He'll hold the files from his son's research with a remorseful look on his face. I guess that's why he chose to move to administrative work.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 12.ogg Utayba: But if you claim that the Canned Knowledge was originating from the Akademiya, then Taj is indeed a suspect.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 13.ogg Utayba: Because he was the only one who could have recently gone through research files about the Court of Desolation.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 14.ogg Utayba: There are so many files about those ruins that it would be difficult to restart any research, since the seven original researchers were put behind bars. It's hard enough just trying to make sense of these files.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 15.ogg Utayba: However, if the files were made into Canned Knowledge, they could be understood immediately. By doing so, one could restart the research outside the Akademiya without anyone ever noticing.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 16.ogg Utayba: According to the legends, the treasures inside the Court of Desolation could allow someone see [sic] beyond life and death, or even bring the dead back to life, right? So maybe Taj is trying to bring Murtada back.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 17.ogg Utayba: Though, I don't really believe Taj would ever try to do something like that. I'm just telling you what I know. It's the job of the matra to find the truth and track down criminals.
Media:vo cnlq003 5 utayba 18.ogg Utayba: Do you have any questions? If not, it'd be best if you would leave now.
Media:vo cnlq003 9 jehnam 01.ogg Jehnam: No, not that I'm aware of. Perhaps you could ask someone else?
Media:vo cnlq003 9 nabil 01.ogg Nabil: Excuse me, have you seen any large shipments of goods leaving the Akademiya recently?
Media:vo dialog cnlq003 badr 01.ogg Badr: The Akademiya has goods coming in and out every day. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
Media:vo dialog cnlq003 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: By the way, something strange happened a few days ago.
Media:vo dialog cnlq003 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: A merchant approached me and requested that I cover the cost of a "Desert Travel Kit." One million, two hundred and fifty thousand Mora.
Media:vo dialog cnlq003 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: I didn't remember owing anyone Mora, especially not that kind of amount. So I arrested the merchant on charges of provocation and disturbing the peace.
Media:vo dialog cnlq003 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: Do you know anything about this?
Media:vo dialog cnlq003 jehnam 01.ogg Jehnam: Didn't I tell you already? I didn't see anything.
Media:vo dialog cnlq003 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh, no—nope... Paimon has no idea what that could be!
Media:vo dialog cnlq003 payam 01.ogg Payam: Huh, was my intuition right? Was there really something wrong with those goods?
Media:vo dialog cnlq003 usem 01.ogg Usem: Taj lives on the outskirts of Sumeru City. You can try looking for him there.
Media:vo dialog cnlq003 utayba 01.ogg Utayba: We have an alarm set behind the bookshelf for security purposes. Be careful not to bump it when you're taking out the files.
Media:vo dialog cnlq003 utayba 02.ogg Utayba: Hmm? Do you have any other questions?
Murtada Radkani (adult, voice only): Alright, Dad
Murtada Radkani (adult, voice only): By the way, I've finally found an area of research I wish to pursue
Murtada Radkani (adult, voice only): Let's start over
Murtada Radkani (adult, voice only): Why can't you show even a little leniency?
Murtada Radkani (adult, voice only): Why...?
Murtada Radkani (child, voice only): Dad
Murtada Radkani (child, voice only): I'm always the only one
Murtada Radkani (child, voice only): Who gets in trouble...
Murtada Radkani (child, voice only): Why are they so strict with me?
Murtada Radkani (young man, voice only): Don't worry
Murtada Radkani (young man, voice only): I won't damage your precious reputation!
Murtada Radkani (young man, voice only): Just leave me alone!
Nabil explains the situation to the repository's manager...
Nabil runs off and returns with someone shortly later.
Researchers who study the history of the Court of Desolation mainly go through three stages: Discovery, Investigation, and Fanaticism.
Sealed Materials: Court of Desolation
Secret Text Interpretation Manual: (Records an account of a Haravatat Researcher being sentenced to prison for deciphering forbidden documents.)
Taj Radkani: Because...
Taj Radkani: We are Matra
The earliest stage of research is the relatively basic "Discovery" phase, which causes little to no harm. The results of their discoveries will show that treasures related to life and death may be hidden within the Court of Desolation. This is also where the rumor of "bringing the dead back to life" may begin.
Two different interpretations of the line have quickly emerged as a result. Some believe that "the price of one's life" is the key to entering the Court of Desolation, while others asserted that it was a requirement for the Court to appear. Because the Court of Desolation has never been discovered, the latter view gradually became mainstream.
Utayba activates the device, and a secret door opens in the wall...
You enter Taj's home and search around...
You give Nabil the letter from Cyno.
You tell Cyno everything that's happened.
