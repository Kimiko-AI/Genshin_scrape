 But everyone else is trying so hard.
 Calm down.
 Could she have started arguing with her father again?
 I heard a voice.
 Inayah said that her father doesn't care for interpersonal relationships.
 Is it Inayah?
 Is it only for art and performance?
 Lots of people are rooting for us.
 No one should bear all the blame.
 Please explain.
 Quest DescriptionWith your encouragement, Nilou decided to debate with the Akademiya scholar about the demolition of the theatre. Thus, she needs to collect a lot of information.
 She has it in the bag.
 She still couldn't bring herself to support it.
 She's already a first-rate adventurer.
 She's too harsh on herself.
 So, even after we decided to go for the debate...
 Step DescriptionThe information collection went well, but Inayah seems to be quite pessimistic about the debate...
 Success comes from hard work.
 That's right.
 The theater's existence...
 There is nothing in this world that is impossible.
 There's still one problem left unsolved.
 This is your new beginning.
 This may be his weak point.
 This might have something to do with Inayah.
 We haven't broken any rules.
 Why are you so sure of this?
 You don't have to be so hard on yourself anymore.
 You seem to have many stories of your own.
Everyone gathers together. After hearing Nilou's thoughts...
Media:vo dialog nllq002 abe 01.ogg Abhi: Watch out, Mr. Bad Guy! Pow, bam!
Media:vo dialog nllq002 hushang 01.ogg Hushang: Everything will work itself out.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 inayah 01.ogg Inayah: Everything is ready. The only thing left is to wait until the day after tomorrow.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 jut 01.ogg Jut: As things stand, there actually isn't much to worry about.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 kourosh 01.ogg Kourosh: When the day comes, I'll get my friends and the theater's customers to come and support Nilou.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 kourosh 02.ogg Kourosh: If anything goes wrong, I'll have them scream and shout and drown out whatever Sharif says.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 kourosh 03.ogg Kourosh: ...Eh, I can't do that? *sigh* Fine, I'll think of something else...
Media:vo dialog nllq002 negar 01.ogg Najia: I've gained a whole new level of respect for you.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 negar 02.ogg Najia: Inayah was right. It's true that I couldn't bear to bring down Nilou.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 negar 03.ogg Najia: It wasn't out of pity or anything, though. I just felt like I didn't have the right to say anything.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 negar 04.ogg Najia: After all, Nilou was the one who bravely stepped up and proposed to fight back. I didn't have that kind of courage or initiative.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 negar 05.ogg Najia: I'd be a terrible person if I spoke badly of Nilou without doing anything to help.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 negar 06.ogg Najia: She knows better than any of us how difficult this path will be.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Hehe, I hope I'll actually be able to get some sleep over the next two nights.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 qasani 01.ogg Khasani: Although we can find a form of beauty in regret and disappointment, it makes no sense to just accept this world's tragedies.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 rikard 01.ogg Rekhar: Consider this as a trial by fire.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 rikard 02.ogg Rekhar: No matter the outcome, there will be treasure at its end.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 sheikhzubayr 01.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: Just notify the customers when you have time. There's no rush.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 sheikhzubayr 02.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: ...Looks like this situation is really affecting her.
Media:vo dialog nllq002 sorin 01.ogg Sohrin: No one is allowed to bully Miss Nilou!
Media:vo nllq002 1 abe 01.ogg Abhi: Beat the bad guy! Justice will prevail!
Media:vo nllq002 1 inayah 01.ogg Inayah: Not to rain on your parade, but my father is a real hard guy to deal with.
Media:vo nllq002 1 inayah 02.ogg Inayah: He is erudite, meticulous, demanding, and exceedingly familiar with rigorous logic. It'll be extremely difficult to beat him in a debate.
Media:vo nllq002 1 inayah 03.ogg Inayah: You all already knew that, but you just didn't want to hurt Nilou's feelings.
Media:vo nllq002 1 inayah 04.ogg Inayah: When all's said and done, aren't you hurting her just the same?
Media:vo nllq002 1 inayah 05.ogg Inayah: ...
Media:vo nllq002 1 inayah 06.ogg Inayah: Sorry, I ruined the mood.
Media:vo nllq002 1 inayah 07.ogg Inayah: I just can't force myself to expect a positive outcome. Nilou shouldn't have to push herself for the sake of an impossible goal.
Media:vo nllq002 1 inayah 08.ogg Inayah: ...I understand what you're trying to say. I also have my own intense feelings of anger and regret.
Media:vo nllq002 1 inayah 09.ogg Inayah: Yes, I can.
Media:vo nllq002 1 inayah 10.ogg Inayah: ...Right.
Media:vo nllq002 1 kourosh 01.ogg Kourosh: Sure, in fiction, but I'm not sure how well that will translate to reality...
Media:vo nllq002 1 kourosh 02.ogg Kourosh: I—I'm not saying that I don't support you, Nilou. If you need my help, just say the word!
Media:vo nllq002 1 kourosh 03.ogg Kourosh: Anything is better than just standing aside and watching the theater get demolished.
Media:vo nllq002 1 negar 01.ogg Najia: I'm also pitching in. Let's show the Akademiya that we have some fight in us!
Media:vo nllq002 1 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Thank you, everyone. I feel a lot less nervous with your support!
Media:vo nllq002 1 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: You're right, Inayah.
Media:vo nllq002 1 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: We're up against the Akademiya. Everyone knows that they're very powerful. Being skeptical might actually be the more normal response.
Media:vo nllq002 1 nilou 04.ogg Nilou: But I still want to try. I'm reluctant to just let Zubayr Theater go.
Media:vo nllq002 1 nilou 05.ogg Nilou: And it's not just me — I think everyone else here feels the same way. If we're unhappy, we should speak up and let our voices be heard.
Media:vo nllq002 1 nilou 06.ogg Nilou: Say what's on your mind, and do what you think should be done. If we fail after that, then at least we won't have any regrets.
Media:vo nllq002 1 nilou 07.ogg Nilou: I mean... after all, the only thing we can control right now is our choice at this very moment.
Media:vo nllq002 1 nilou 08.ogg Nilou: Then, could I trouble you to tell your father about our plan for a debate?
Media:vo nllq002 1 nilou 09.ogg Nilou: You can still get in touch with your family, right?
Media:vo nllq002 1 nilou 10.ogg Nilou: Then, please help us pass on my request. I've never participated in a debate, and truth be told, I'm still not really confident in myself.
Media:vo nllq002 1 nilou 11.ogg Nilou: But since we've decided on a debate, I'll do my best to prepare for it. I'll gather everyone's thoughts and let them be known to all during the debate.
Media:vo nllq002 1 nilou 12.ogg Nilou: I by myself definitely don't have enough wisdom to beat your father, but what about the entire theater combined? Then we should have a chance, right?
Media:vo nllq002 1 nilou 13.ogg Nilou: Hee-hee, you two, we aren't getting into a fight.
Media:vo nllq002 1 nilou 14.ogg Nilou: But thank you for your encouraging words. I'll do my best!
Media:vo nllq002 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yeah! It's way too early to give up.
Media:vo nllq002 1 qasani 01.ogg Khasani: I am in favor of such a romantic feat. No playwright will turn down a compelling underdog story.
Media:vo nllq002 1 rikard 01.ogg Rekhar: I don't think it's entirely hopeless. To Sharif, Nilou's approach will come off as naive, but that kind of frankness is exactly what they lack the most.
Media:vo nllq002 1 rikard 02.ogg Rekhar: Things might turn out differently from what you expect.
Media:vo nllq002 1 sheikhzubayr 01.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: Trying to best the Akademiya in a debate is attempting the impossible.
Media:vo nllq002 1 sheikhzubayr 02.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: If you really want to try, I won't stop you. It's not like our situation can get any worse.
Media:vo nllq002 1 sheikhzubayr 03.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: That's enough, Inayah. Hehe...
Media:vo nllq002 1 sorin 01.ogg Sohrin: That's right, Miss Nilou!
Media:vo nllq002 1 sorin 02.ogg Sohrin: Make him eat dirt!
Media:vo nllq002 10 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Once you get to know him, you'll realize that he's actually a big softie at heart. He'll even help out with furniture repair and painting the stage!
Media:vo nllq002 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: He really seemed to care a lot about the theater...
Media:vo nllq002 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wow, Paimon didn't think he had that in him at all!
Media:vo nllq002 11 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Mr. Zubayr, we're trying to put together a list of arguments that might be useful. Any ideas?
Media:vo nllq002 11 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: Alright, got it!
Media:vo nllq002 11 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: I've never thought about leaving your theater, Mr. Zubayr. I truly love this place, and I want to keep dancing here.
Media:vo nllq002 11 nilou 04.ogg Nilou: I also want to keep dancing with everyone else.
Media:vo nllq002 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Do we really have to...?
Media:vo nllq002 11 sheikhzubayr 01.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: It won't be difficult to explain our position. They're in the wrong, and they know it!
Media:vo nllq002 11 sheikhzubayr 02.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: I have meticulously managed this theater's affairs for years, and I have abided by every procedure and obtained every permit.
Media:vo nllq002 11 sheikhzubayr 03.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: I did all of that to protect ourselves if something like this were to occur. I didn't expect them to disregard the rules altogether...
Media:vo nllq002 11 sheikhzubayr 04.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: Yes, I know. But anyone who's staying at the theater is one of us.
Media:vo nllq002 11 sheikhzubayr 05.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: If I can't even protect the members of the theater from outside pressure, then I have failed in my duty as a manager.
Media:vo nllq002 11 sheikhzubayr 06.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: In summary, you need sufficient confidence and strict adherence to the rules. At least for now, they don't have the authority to demolish the theater.
Media:vo nllq002 11 sheikhzubayr 07.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: As long as you double down on that point and force them to concede it, you'll gain an advantage.
Media:vo nllq002 11 sheikhzubayr 08.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: *sigh* I've seen many situations like this before. The Akademiya sure likes to get its nose into everyone's business...
Media:vo nllq002 11 sheikhzubayr 09.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: While you prepare for the debate, I will also prepare the theater for the potential aftermath. It's best to prepare for the worst outcome.
Media:vo nllq002 11 sheikhzubayr 10.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: Once you're done chatting, do me a favor and tell our customers that we're canceling all of our shows.
Media:vo nllq002 11 sheikhzubayr 11.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: Right now, no one's in the right frame of mind to perform. I have to consider both our staff and our customers. This is the only way.
Media:vo nllq002 11 sheikhzubayr 12.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: ...Nilou, you are incredible.
Media:vo nllq002 11 sheikhzubayr 13.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: With your talent and youth, you had the least to lose out of all of us. And yet, you were still the first to take a stand.
Media:vo nllq002 11 sheikhzubayr 14.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: You're becoming more and more like her...
Media:vo nllq002 11 sheikhzubayr 15.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: Do your best. We'll do all that we can, and leave the rest to fate.
Media:vo nllq002 13 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: My teacher. She was an excellent dancer, but she's retired now.
Media:vo nllq002 13 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: If we have time later, I'd be happy to tell you more about her.
Media:vo nllq002 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: "Her"?
Media:vo nllq002 14 afshin 01.ogg Afshin: *sigh* They're messing with us again.
Media:vo nllq002 14 afshin 02.ogg Afshin: Mine too! So, what was their excuse, anyway? They still not a fan of the theater's programs?
Media:vo nllq002 14 afshin 03.ogg Afshin: Exactly. They want to look down on us? Haha, we'll look down on them first!
Media:vo nllq002 14 afshin 04.ogg Afshin: Heh, gotta show them who has the people's support!
Media:vo nllq002 14 farhad 01.ogg Farhad: You're here! Is the theater actually closing!?
Media:vo nllq002 14 farhad 02.ogg Farhad: H—Hey, you too!
Media:vo nllq002 14 farhad 03.ogg Farhad: What the heck!? That came with no warning!
Media:vo nllq002 14 farhad 04.ogg Farhad: Don't tell me you'll have to listen to him?
Media:vo nllq002 14 farhad 05.ogg Farhad: Yeah, it IS a direct order from the Akademiya...
Media:vo nllq002 14 farhad 06.ogg Farhad: Good thing they have the power to make rash decisions about things they don't even understand, huh?
Media:vo nllq002 14 farhad 07.ogg Farhad: Right. They might think that some forms of knowledge are more valuable than others, but everyone can equally appreciate art.
Media:vo nllq002 14 farhad 08.ogg Farhad: If they don't believe that, send 'em my way. I got them beat on this subject.
Media:vo nllq002 14 farhad 09.ogg Farhad: Ignore him — he's joking. Just do things your way.
Media:vo nllq002 14 farhad 10.ogg Farhad: No matter what, we will always support you.
Media:vo nllq002 14 hushang 01.ogg Hushang: He's been worried sick for a while now. He wouldn't stop talking the whole way back.
Media:vo nllq002 14 hushang 02.ogg Hushang: C'mon, you know the answer to that.
Media:vo nllq002 14 hushang 03.ogg Hushang: Yeah, they need to touch more grass, not books.
Media:vo nllq002 14 hushang 04.ogg Hushang: Maybe you can prepare some questions on the details of dance performance to make things harder for them at the debate?
Media:vo nllq002 14 jut 01.ogg Jut: What exactly happened? Did someone come down from the Akademiya?
Media:vo nllq002 14 jut 02.ogg Jut: Really? That's terrific. You have my full support, no doubt about that.
Media:vo nllq002 14 jut 03.ogg Jut: Don't worry, everyone here has your back. The Akademiya's recklessness won't get them any praise.
Media:vo nllq002 14 jut 04.ogg Jut: There are always more solutions than problems. If you need help during the debate, just shout and the entire Grand Bazaar will be at your beck and call.
Media:vo nllq002 14 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Yes. He told us that we have to shut down the theater within thirty days, and that it's going to be demolished...
Media:vo nllq002 14 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: There's no need to worry, though. I'm preparing for a public debate with the Akademiya.
Media:vo nllq002 14 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: If I win, we might be able to overturn things and change their minds.
Media:vo nllq002 14 nilou 04.ogg Nilou: Yeah, something like that...
Media:vo nllq002 14 nilou 05.ogg Nilou: Hmm... Sounds like a good idea. Maybe that's something I should do.
Media:vo nllq002 14 nilou 06.ogg Nilou: Thank you all so much! Your understanding and support make me feel a lot better.
Media:vo nllq002 16 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: I feel like the pieces are starting to fall into place...
Media:vo nllq002 16 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: Let's head back to the theater and organize our thoughts.
Media:vo nllq002 16 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Sounds good! Inayah should also be back soon.
Media:vo nllq002 17 abe 01.ogg Abhi: No, Miss Nilou! Miss Inayah isn't back yet.
Media:vo nllq002 17 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Abhi, have you seen Miss Inayah?
Media:vo nllq002 17 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: ...
Media:vo nllq002 17 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: Ahhhh... Oh no.
Media:vo nllq002 17 nilou 04.ogg Nilou: (Traveler), Paimon! I think I've messed up big time...
Media:vo nllq002 17 nilou 05.ogg Nilou: What if Inayah never planned to come back?
Media:vo nllq002 17 nilou 06.ogg Nilou: It's just a gut feeling, but knowing her, she probably feels like she's completely responsible for what happened.
Media:vo nllq002 17 nilou 07.ogg Nilou: She probably thinks that all of this happened because she was staying here.
Media:vo nllq002 17 nilou 08.ogg Nilou: She has a long-standing conflict with her father. That's why she ran away from home.
Media:vo nllq002 17 nilou 09.ogg Nilou: She doesn't think that we can win the debate, and she doesn't want to implicate us, so she thought leaving was the best thing to do...
Media:vo nllq002 17 nilou 10.ogg Nilou: Exactly. She's being too pessimistic. How will you know if you don't try?
Media:vo nllq002 17 nilou 11.ogg Nilou: Anyway, first things first, we have to get her back!
Media:vo nllq002 17 nilou 12.ogg Nilou: I think I might know. Let's start by looking outside the city.
Media:vo nllq002 17 nilou 13.ogg Nilou: Before I brought her to Zubayr Theater, she was staying at a remote campsite. She got a fever from drinking unclean water, so I carried her back.
Media:vo nllq002 17 nilou 14.ogg Nilou: If she has nowhere else to go after leaving the theater, she might go back and strike out on her own again.
Media:vo nllq002 17 nilou 15.ogg Nilou: Yes, let's hurry.
Media:vo nllq002 17 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wasn't she just passing on a message? Does she really need this much time?
Media:vo nllq002 17 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What!?
Media:vo nllq002 17 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh right, as soon as her father showed up, she said that her father was targeting her. So she's felt like that this whole time...
Media:vo nllq002 17 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Mhm, and then she just quietly left afterward...
Media:vo nllq002 17 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: ...But where should we start? Sumeru is huge!
Media:vo nllq002 17 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Then let's go take a look!
Media:vo nllq002 19 inayah 01.ogg ???: Aaah—!
(A growl is heard alongside the voice)
Media:vo nllq002 19 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: There are signs that someone had stayed here very recently...
Media:vo nllq002 19 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: I heard it, too. Let's investigate.
Media:vo nllq002 19 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: But we can't confirm if it was Inayah or not.
Media:vo nllq002 19 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's take a look around first!
Media:vo nllq002 19 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Did you hear that?
Media:vo nllq002 2 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: I felt that I might have said a bit too much...
Media:vo nllq002 2 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: Anyway, we better start preparing now. First, let's see what everyone thinks about the situation.
Media:vo nllq002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Well said back there, Nilou!
Media:vo nllq002 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Alright, time to poll everyone's thoughts!
Media:vo nllq002 20 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Yeah, we're almost there!
Media:vo nllq002 20 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It sounds like we're getting closer. The voice is coming from over there!
Media:vo nllq002 21 inayah 01.ogg Inayah: Stay back!
Media:vo nllq002 21 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Inayah, don't be scared! We're coming to help!
Media:vo nllq002 21 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's Inayah! She's being attacked by wild animals!
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 01.ogg Inayah: T—Thank you...
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 02.ogg Inayah: There weren't so many big animals in this area before. They chased after me for a long time...
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 03.ogg Inayah: Sorry, I'm causing trouble for you again...
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 04.ogg Inayah: No, I just thought it would take too much effort.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 05.ogg Inayah: Everything happened because of me. If I'm gone, then the situation will resolve itself.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 06.ogg Inayah: It's alright if it's me. As long as the theater won't get demolished...
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 07.ogg Inayah: You guys are the kindest people I've ever met. You shouldn't suffer so much because of me.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 08.ogg Inayah: Nilou, there will always be a victim, whether it's me or the theater. You can't eat your cake and have it, too.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 09.ogg Inayah: You can't win a debate against the Akademiya, especially since your opponent will be my father.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 10.ogg Inayah: My father is an extremely demanding man.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 11.ogg Inayah: He's always wanted me to become an exceptional researcher and his academic successor.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 12.ogg Inayah: I tried my best to meet his expectations, and did everything I could.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 13.ogg Inayah: But he still wasn't satisfied... or rather, he had just never been satisfied with me.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 14.ogg Inayah: I'm no genius, but whenever he berated me, it was always as if he was asking me, "Why aren't you a genius?"
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 15.ogg Inayah: Yeah, like I'd know...
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 16.ogg Inayah: At first, I thought that Father would slowly come to terms with reality, but he just wouldn't stop berating me.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 17.ogg Inayah: For one exam, I earned the third-highest score.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 18.ogg Inayah: I thought that all my hard work had finally paid off, that I could finally make Father feel some modicum of joy.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 19.ogg Inayah: I even used the embroidery skills I learned at school to make a commemorative gift for him.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 20.ogg Inayah: I thought... "Even this daughter can make her father happy sometimes, right?"
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 21.ogg Inayah: Yeah, sorry for not bringing it up. These are not pleasant memories for me.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 22.ogg Inayah: I was tired of him yelling at me every day. All I wanted was to see him smile at me.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 23.ogg Inayah: But... He was more angry than ever before once I'd given him my embroidery and told him my score. He flung my present to the side.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 24.ogg Inayah: "You think you should be proud of third place? Reflect on why you weren't first!"
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 25.ogg Inayah: I forgot how long I had cried for. I only remember my parents arguing. My mother also thought he went overboard.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 26.ogg Inayah: They argued for such a long time. My father eventually stormed out and slammed the door behind him. I didn't get a single sentence of apology, or any words of comfort...
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 27.ogg Inayah: I've completely given up. We're destined to never understand each other.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 28.ogg Inayah: I don't think you can beat him in a debate, because he doesn't even understand what kind of place a theater is.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 29.ogg Inayah: He can never understand the relationship performers have with their audience. His life is devoid of camaraderie or friendship.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 30.ogg Inayah: He just wants everything to happen according to his wishes, as if the world revolves around him.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 31.ogg Inayah: What we cherish — our little place in this world — means nothing to him...
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 32.ogg Inayah: Interpret it...?
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 33.ogg Inayah: Oh...
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 34.ogg Inayah: When I ran away from home, I swore that I would leave my family conflict behind...
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 35.ogg Inayah: But you're right, all I'm doing now is falling right back into it...
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 36.ogg Inayah: You're right, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 37.ogg Inayah: I'm not trying to meet his expectations, so why should I give up because of him?
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 38.ogg Inayah: I can't afford to lose anything more... We have to win.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 39.ogg Inayah: The debate will not only protect Zubayr Theater, but also allow me to settle things with Father.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 40.ogg Inayah: Let's go. I'll tell my father about the debate.
Media:vo nllq002 22 inayah 41.ogg Inayah: I know him very well. Even if he looks down on us, I know how to make him accept.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Why did you leave by yourself?
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: You really don't think we have a chance at winning the debate?
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: Listen to me, Inayah.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 04.ogg Nilou: Even if you were the reason that all of this happened, no one would blame you.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 05.ogg Nilou: Mr. Zubayr said that you're one of us, so that means we will protect you.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 06.ogg Nilou: No matter what happens, we'll stand as one.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 07.ogg Nilou: I see... When we were embroidering your gift before, I didn't feel like you were new at it.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 08.ogg Nilou: How horrible...
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 09.ogg Nilou: I understand now, Inayah.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 10.ogg Nilou: But, when we were preparing for the debate, I heard something quite wise. Maybe it'll help you.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 11.ogg Nilou: Ms. Rekhar has gone through a lot in her life, but she told us that she's very happy to live at the theater now.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 12.ogg Nilou: Although she ran into misfortune, it led her down a new path in life. She sees that as a blessing.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 13.ogg Nilou: She told me that the most important thing about an experience is how you choose to interpret it.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 14.ogg Nilou: I can sympathize with your unhappiness at home, but after you ran away, you ended up at the theater and became one of us.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 15.ogg Nilou: Those unhappy experiences allowed you to really cherish your bonds with everyone, and also gave you the opportunity to become friends with us.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 16.ogg Nilou: Don't let your past suffering keep you from the new life that you've worked so hard to find.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 17.ogg Nilou: Maybe you'll disappoint him, but that doesn't matter. You have a new future waiting for you.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 18.ogg Nilou: Don't let go of the answer you've worked so hard to find.
Media:vo nllq002 22 nilou 19.ogg Nilou: Alright, let's go.
Media:vo nllq002 22 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yeah! Everyone's working together towards a happier ending. No one should be singled out for blame.
Media:vo nllq002 22 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So that's why you ran away from home?
Media:vo nllq002 22 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: It sounds like your past has had a huge impact on you.
Media:vo nllq002 22 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Let the past stay in the past.
Media:vo nllq002 22 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: That's right! If we put our heads together, there's bound to be a way!
Media:vo nllq002 22 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: That's the spirit!
Media:vo nllq002 23 inayah 01.ogg Inayah: Well, I'm off to meet with him. Please wait here for me.
Media:vo nllq002 23 inayah 02.ogg Inayah: Sorry for the wait. I'm back.
Media:vo nllq002 23 inayah 03.ogg Inayah: Things went a lot more smoothly than I expected. It didn't take long for him to accept the debate, and is set for two days from now.
Media:vo nllq002 23 inayah 04.ogg Inayah: ...Why are you all smiling so much? Did something good happen?
Media:vo nllq002 23 inayah 05.ogg Inayah: Hehe, fingers crossed!
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Okay. Looking forward to your good news.
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: Phew, that should be everything. The only thing left to do now is to wait until the debate.
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: I'm not sure why, but I'm getting nervous again.
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 04.ogg Nilou: Thanks for that, Paimon.
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 05.ogg Nilou: But I still feel like it'll be an uphill battle. I need to be calmer, cooler, and more collected.
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 06.ogg Nilou: Yeah. I'm acting as everyone's representative, so I'll need to act brave, even if I won't feel like it.
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 07.ogg Nilou: Huh? What's left?
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 08.ogg Nilou: Wait... You're not asking what the theater DOES, but what it IS.
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 09.ogg Nilou: Lemme think... Um, how can I put this? Hmm...
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 10.ogg Nilou: Ah, got it!
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 11.ogg Nilou: When we were trying to find a way to save the theater, we heard many stories not of the theater, but of the people whose lives have been touched by it.
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 12.ogg Nilou: Zubayr Theater is our reason for coming together. It connects us all in unique ways.
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 13.ogg Nilou: In other words, it's like a bond!
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 14.ogg Nilou: The theater provides money for Ms. Rekhar and her children, inspiration for Mr. Khasani, and enjoyment for the people of the Great Bazaar.
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 15.ogg Nilou: It also gives Inayah shelter from her family... It has brought us together after taking care of every single one of us.
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 16.ogg Nilou: And its story won't end here. In the future, many more people will come to the theater and receive its blessing.
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 17.ogg Nilou: And we'll all be there for them. Our warm, welcoming community will show them the same kindness we were shown in the past.
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 18.ogg Nilou: Aside from the delivery of performances, isn't this another reason for Zubayr Theater's continued existence?
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 19.ogg Nilou: I feel like that's another prong in our attack. Thank you so much.
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 20.ogg Nilou: Hee-hee, we've just finished our prep. Rest easy, it will all turn out well!
Media:vo nllq002 23 nilou 21.ogg Nilou: We have to win... No, we WILL win, Inayah.
Media:vo nllq002 23 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: You were great, Nilou! Your words won over Inayah.
Media:vo nllq002 23 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Talk like that during the debate, and you'll get an easy win!
Media:vo nllq002 23 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh? What a strange question...
Media:vo nllq002 23 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Isn't a theater just a theater? Why would it need to be anything else?
Media:vo nllq002 23 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: A bond?
Media:vo nllq002 23 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Yeah, that makes sense! We definitely felt that warmth during the preparations for the event.
Media:vo nllq002 23 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: But, Paimon doesn't see how this will help in the debate.
Media:vo nllq002 23 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Oh, gotcha. No matter how strong an opponent is, they'll have to go on the defensive if pressed on a weak point!
Media:vo nllq002 23 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Paimon also feels a lot more relieved. Let's show him what we got!
Media:vo nllq002 23 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: We realized that your dad might not be as scary as we had thought.
Media:vo nllq002 25 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: (No, there should be something else that's more relevant.)
Media:vo nllq002 25 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: (Not quite right, but it's close. I almost have it...)
Media:vo nllq002 25 nilou 04.ogg Nilou: (Mr. Zubayr has been meticulously managing the theater. Everything checks out.)
Media:vo nllq002 25 nilou 05.ogg Nilou: (Everyone is free to appreciate art — no form of art is inherently superior.)
Media:vo nllq002 25 nilou 06.ogg Nilou: (Inayah really wants to win. She doesn't wanna lose anything else because of her painful past.)
Media:vo nllq002 25 qasani 01.ogg Khasani: Art must first be appreciated by others to confer value.
Media:vo nllq002 25 rikard 01.ogg Rekhar: The most important thing about an experience is how you choose to interpret it.
Media:vo nllq002 6 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Sorry... If the theater really ends up getting demolished, then you, Sohrin, and Abhi will all...
Media:vo nllq002 6 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: But won't you have regrets if things just come to an abrupt end? It'd be like when you were forced to stop adventuring...
Media:vo nllq002 6 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: You have a point...
Media:vo nllq002 6 nilou 04.ogg Nilou: Thank you, Ms. Rekhar.
Media:vo nllq002 6 nilou 05.ogg Nilou: Y—You're too kind...
Media:vo nllq002 6 nilou 06.ogg Nilou: Alright, I gotta cheer up! I can't waste everyone's words of encouragement!
Media:vo nllq002 6 nilou 07.ogg Nilou: Haaah, I feel a lot better.
Media:vo nllq002 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Are you... trying to make us feel better?
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 01.ogg Rekhar: I didn't expect you all to challenge the Akademiya.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 02.ogg Rekhar: That reminded me of my younger years... Back then, I feared nothing and no one, and I was always charging into the most dangerous of places.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 03.ogg Rekhar: I can't do things like that anymore, but those were some of the best times of my life.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 04.ogg Rekhar: It's alright. There's no need to think such heavy thoughts. Even if the building gets demolished, its people will still all be here.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 05.ogg Rekhar: Have faith in the resilience of an adventurer. We can always figure something out.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 06.ogg Rekhar: Ah, so that's what you were worrying about.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 07.ogg Rekhar: Relax, I've had a lot of experience with regret. Things are painful at first, but as they say, time heals all wounds.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 08.ogg Rekhar: Look at us now: Sohrin and Abhi are happy, and Sohrin has also just passed his theater exam. He can start acting soon.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 09.ogg Rekhar: He was thrilled because he can soon perform on the same stage as you.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 10.ogg Rekhar: We wouldn't be here if it weren't for our past struggles. And would Sohrin have become a happier person? That's hard to say.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 11.ogg Rekhar: Yes, but I truly do mean what I say. Being here at the theater has taught me an important lesson.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 12.ogg Rekhar: The most important thing about an experience is how you choose to interpret it.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 13.ogg Rekhar: I can choose to believe that my life ended with my husband's death, or I can choose to believe that it was a blessing in disguise for Sohrin and Abhi.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 14.ogg Rekhar: Similarly, even if this theater disappears, a new beginning might just be around the corner.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 15.ogg Rekhar: "Good" and "bad" are all human-made concepts. It all depends on how we choose to see things.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 16.ogg Rekhar: Nilou, I know how important Zubayr Theater is to you.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 17.ogg Rekhar: But you don't have to be so nervous — we're all here with you. The theater won't go down so easily.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 18.ogg Rekhar: No need to thank me. If anything, you inspired me with your bravery. You might have what it takes to become an excellent adventurer.
Media:vo nllq002 6 rikard 19.ogg Rekhar: Good. My children and I will be cheering you on at the debate.
Media:vo nllq002 8 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: We probably do need to tackle this question if we want to prove the value of the arts.
Media:vo nllq002 8 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: I don't know how to explain it, but all I know is that when my performance makes the audience happy, I also become very happy.
Media:vo nllq002 8 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: Does that count as a meaning?
Media:vo nllq002 8 nilou 04.ogg Nilou: Hey, don't say something like that...
Media:vo nllq002 8 nilou 05.ogg Nilou: When you put it that way...
Media:vo nllq002 8 nilou 06.ogg Nilou: Mr. Zubayr and I refused to follow the Akademiya's orders to change our shows for a similar reason.
Media:vo nllq002 8 nilou 07.ogg Nilou: To put it simply, we were afraid that our shows would lose their meaning if people couldn't understand them...
Media:vo nllq002 8 nilou 08.ogg Nilou: I understand. Thank you for your words of encouragement, Mr. Khasani.
Media:vo nllq002 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Paimon doesn't really wanna talk to him...
Media:vo nllq002 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ooh, Paimon will listen to that!
Media:vo nllq002 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ugh... This again?
Media:vo nllq002 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: You answered him so seriously! Careful, Nilou, this guy's ramblings never make any sense.
Media:vo nllq002 8 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: It was that life-changing...?
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 01.ogg Khasani: So you've already developed some prejudices against me. And to think, I was just about to put forward a suggestion...
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 02.ogg Khasani: Although, I know not if you have a new answer to my previous question. Now seems like an appropriate time to revisit it.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 03.ogg Khasani: What do you think is the meaning of art?
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 04.ogg Khasani: No, no, Nilou's answer far surpasses yours, and it is close to my own.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 05.ogg Khasani: The meaning of art comes not from its creators, but from its audience.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 06.ogg Khasani: In other words, only art that can be appreciated by others will impart its essence and value upon the minds of its audience.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 07.ogg Khasani: This is something that the Akademiya can never understand.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 08.ogg Khasani: I once pursued the mastery of art, much like how a researcher would chase wisdom and knowledge.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 09.ogg Khasani: However, the more of a connoisseur I became, the less I felt I understood. I began to question what it truly meant for art to be "understood" at all.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 10.ogg Khasani: I found that I could comprehend even the most complex and sophisticated of works, and yet somehow, that provided me with little solace.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 11.ogg Khasani: I remained ever perplexed about this conundrum until I visited this theater, and watched one of Nilou's performances.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 12.ogg Khasani: Everyone here had a joyous part in the overall experience. The actors upon the stage basked in the love of their audience, while those in the house immersed themselves in the wondrous ambiance.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 13.ogg Khasani: In all honesty, from a purely critical point of view, the performances here are exceedingly average.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 14.ogg Khasani: But what bewildered me was how despite the performances' middling quality, they captivated their whole audience... they captivated even me.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 15.ogg Khasani: I realized then that I had walked the wrong road. The mastery of art was never what I truly wanted.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 16.ogg Khasani: I left the so-called frontiers of artistic research and came to this theater, for this is where I can finally find what I seek.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 17.ogg Khasani: Art will no longer be a castle in the sky. Whether it be inspiring or entertaining, art must be appreciated by others to confer value.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 18.ogg Khasani: If art cannot accomplish that, then it is meaningless.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 19.ogg Khasani: I once stood in the spotlight, but I relinquished fame and acclaim for the freedom I enjoy today.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 20.ogg Khasani: I care not for where my feet may take me next, but Nilou, you need to remember one thing.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 21.ogg Khasani: You already stand upon the finest stage there is, and that is a rare gift that should never be taken for granted.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 22.ogg Khasani: You cannot give it up, not even to the Akademiya.
Media:vo nllq002 8 qasani 23.ogg Khasani: Dust the cobwebs away from the eyes of those scholars.
