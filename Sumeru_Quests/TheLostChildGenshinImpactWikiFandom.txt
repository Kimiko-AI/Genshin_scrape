 "Arana"...
 "Arana"...
Paimon: Paimon thinks we heard this name when Iotham was telling that story before...
Arana: Yes. Nara Iotham is Arana's friend.
 "Aranara"...
Paimon: Eh? Did you say Aranara? Now that Paimon's really looking at you, Paimon thinks we really have seen you before...
 "Aranara"...
 "Aranara"...
Paimon: Eh? Did you say Aranara? Now that Paimon's really looking at you, Paimon thinks we really have seen you before...
 "Arana"...
Paimon: Paimon thinks we heard this name when Iotham was telling that story before...
Arana: Yes. Nara Iotham is Arana's friend.
 "Ararakalari"?
Paimon: Ah, yes, right, that was it! Paimon thinks they said it could resist the Marana corrosion or something...
???: Yes. Nara smart. Ararakalari can resist Marana.
 "Marana"?
 "Marana"?
Rana: That's... The Withering.
Iotham: Oh... Yeah, The Withering.
 "Marana's Avatar"?
Iotham: Uh-huh. It does bad things in the world for Marana... It's a big black thing...
 "Marana's Avatar"?
 "Marana's Avatar"?
Iotham: Uh-huh. It does bad things in the world for Marana... It's a big black thing...
 "Marana"?
Rana: That's... The Withering.
Iotham: Oh... Yeah, The Withering.
 (A melody is rising up in my mind...)
 Bija...
 Did Alphonso let you come here?
 Don't worry about that right now, rest up.
 Don't worry.
 Got it. How do we get there?
 I'll go get help.
 I'll take care of this.
 Isn't this the thing we saw before...?
Paimon: Phew... You scared Paimon! Paimon thought you were a talking vegetable...
 It's the Fatui! Where did they come from?
 It's the Fatui. Be careful.
 More and more things I don't understand...
 Narana... That's almost a tongue-twister.
Paimon: You want to help Rana? What do you need us to do?
 Please, that's enough.
Paimon: Rana, you'd better rest now...
 Quest DescriptionYou have taken care of the Withering Zones marked by Rana as well as the Spinocrocodiles. The children at Vimara Village should be safe now. Head back with Rana.
 Rana!
Paimon: No answer... Darn it! What happened?
Paimon: Hm...? These traces...
 Rana, wait for us.
 Sing?
 (A melody is rising up in my mind...)
 Step DescriptionDuring the search for Iotham, you ran into The Eremites and the Fatui. This is bad. You need to get through the obstacles and find him quickly.
 Step DescriptionIotham seems to be trapped in the Withering Zone, and Rana rushed to help regardless of the danger. Go and rescue them.
 Step DescriptionProbably because of the magical green shield, Iotham is merely scared. Rana doesn't look so well, though. Better bring them back to Vimara Village as soon as possible.
 Step DescriptionRana insisted that "a little rest would be enough," and Iotham should be sent back to Vimara Village as soon as possible. But Rana's condition is still worrisome. Go back to her after sending Iotham back.
 Step DescriptionRana is gone. However, some traces appeared from where she was last seen. Follow the traces, and we might find Rana.
 That'll attract Whopperflowers...
Arana: Nara (Traveler), very funny.
 (A melody is rising up in my mind...)
 Then Rana's current condition...
Arana: No worry. Arana will be here and fight Marana corrosion. So, Rana will not get worse.
Arana: But with no Bija, Rana will not get better either.
 There's no time. This is the location, head there as soon as you can.
 Vegetable...
 We'll go get help...
 What are these traces...
 What do you need me to do?
 What is it?
Paimon: Don't worry about that, Rana, you need to rest!
 What was that again?
Paimon: Paimon thinks they said it could resist the Marana corrosion or something... It had a funny name.
???: It is Ararakalari. It can fight Marana. Ararakalari, NOT a funny name.
 What's that green thing...?
 What's that?
 You fought well.
Rana: Really? Hehe, probably because you and Paimon were by my side.
???: It is Ararakalari. It can fight Marana. Ararakalari, NOT a funny name.
???: Woah!
???: Yes. Nara smart. Ararakalari can resist Marana.
Alphonso: ...I see. Iotham, you go rest up.
Alphonso: Eh? Wait...
Alphonso: Iotham? Why are you... and (Traveler)...
Alphonso: It's fine, what matters is that you're okay... Wait here a moment, (Traveler). I'll go with you as soon as I prepare some medicine.
Arana: Aranara are children of the forest, we live with trees. Not like you, Nara (Traveler). You are the child of dandelion, always traveling.
Arana: But that is not enough. To heal Narana, we need Bija. Nara (Traveler) must go to Vanarana and ask everyone to help get Bija.
Arana: But with no Bija, Rana will not get better either.
Arana: Enter our dreams, our world.
Arana: Follow the forest path, keep going towards where water comes from, then you will reach Vanarana.
Arana: How Arana knows, not important. But Arana wants to help Narana, this very important.
Arana: Mm-hmm.
Arana: Nara (Traveler), very funny.
Arana: Nara's life is like tree, bad bugs, like Marana. Only Bija can make Narana better.
Arana: Narana got corroded by Marana, very serious. Bad bugs are biting tree roots. Trees will wither, fruits will rot.
Arana: No worry. Arana will be here and fight Marana corrosion. So, Rana will not get worse.
Arana: Not vegetable, Arana. Arana is friend, Aranara.
Arana: Thank you, you good Nara. She is Arana's very important friend. So, Arana will protect her.
Arana: Then sing.
Arana: This is the Rhythm of the Great Dream. Sing it to enter Vanarana.
Arana: Yes. Nara Iotham is Arana's friend.
Fatui Sergeant: ...Who are you people? Don't get in our way.
Fatui Sergeant: Alphonso...? Whatever, don't think you'll be getting out of here without a fight!
Iotham: ...
Iotham: And I ended up running into Marana...
Iotham: I know... I know... I'm sorry...
Iotham: I'm fine, but Rana, you...
Iotham: I'm sorry, Rana, I'm sorry... I'll never run off like that again, I'll be good and stay home...
Iotham: I'm sorry, Rana...
Iotham: I'm sorry, Rana... I'm sorry...
Iotham: No... Alphonso also told me not to go running off. But I wanted to give Rana something tasty to eat, so I...
Iotham: Oh... Yeah, The Withering.
Iotham: Okay. I'm sorry, Alphonso...
Iotham: Rana! *sob* Just leave me...
Iotham: Rana! Is that you, Rana? *sob*
Iotham: Rana...
Iotham: Rana... I'm sorry...
Iotham: Rana... Waaah...
Iotham: That was Ararakalari... It can protect people from the corrosion of Marana.
Iotham: Uh-huh. It does bad things in the world for Marana... It's a big black thing...
Iotham: Waaah... Alphonso said that the mushrooms here are huge! And I just wanted to bring you some fresh mushrooms to eat... to give you energy...
Iotham: Wah, Rana... and (Traveler)...
Iotham: When I was in the forest, I thought someone was following me... I got scared, I thought it was Marana's Avatar... So, I just kept running... *sob*
Mercenary: Tsk, it's the Forest Watchers... Don't let them sabotage our sponsor's business.
Paimon: ...
Paimon: ...Eh? Paimon's sure this was the place...
Paimon: Ah, yes, right, that was it! Paimon thinks they said it could resist the Marana corrosion or something...
Paimon: Don't worry about that, Rana, you need to rest!
Paimon: Eh? Did you say Aranara? Now that Paimon's really looking at you, Paimon thinks we really have seen you before...
Paimon: Eh? Is that... the kid from Vimara Village?
Paimon: Eh? This looks a lot like the thing that protected Iotham earlier...
Paimon: Eh? What're you doing in... a Withering Zone... And there are so many monsters...
Paimon: Hey! Rana! Can you hear Paimon?
Paimon: Hm...? These traces...
Paimon: How do you know (Traveler)'s name?
Paimon: Iothaaam...!
Paimon: It went across the river. Let's follow it, (Traveler)!
Paimon: It's urgent, so we'll make this quick...
Paimon: Marana... What a strange name.
Paimon: No answer... Darn it! What happened?
Paimon: Okay. Let's go, Iotham. Don't move, Rana! We'll be right back!
Paimon: Paimon hopes Rana had gotten better and walked off on her own...
Paimon: Paimon hopes Rana's okay.
Paimon: Paimon thinks they said it could resist the Marana corrosion or something... It had a funny name.
Paimon: Paimon thinks we heard this name when Iotham was telling that story before...
Paimon: Paimon understands... But Iotham, how did you get stuck in the Withering Zone?
Paimon: Phew... You scared Paimon! Paimon thought you were a talking vegetable...
Paimon: Rana! Can you hear Paimon?
Paimon: Rana, are you really okay...?
Paimon: Rana, you'd better rest now...
Paimon: Rana...
Paimon: That would be great...
Paimon: Uh... So, we need to go somewhere called "Vanarana" and come up with a way to get this Bija, right? Then we can heal Rana?
Paimon: Wah, this is bad, Paimon thinks Rana's condition is getting worse!
Paimon: We'd better follow them... Maybe they're clues left for us by Rana.
Paimon: What's going on here...? Could it be that Ara-thing Iotham and Rana were talking about? What was it called again?
Paimon: Woah!
Paimon: Yeah, we have to hurry back to look after Rana...
Paimon: You want to help Rana? What do you need us to do?
Paimon:Â ?
Rana: (Traveler), please... take Iotham back for me...
Rana: ...
Rana: Alphonso wouldn't do that, he's Iotham's big brother...
Rana: And don't forget... the forest will remember...
Rana: And... did you see... me fight? No... did you see (Traveler) fight? Be sure to thank (him/her)...
Rana: Anyway, we can talk more about that later. Iotham must be somewhere deeper in the cave. We'd better keep moving.
Rana: Can you hear me, Iotham!? Answer me if you can!
Rana: Darn it! (Traveler), let's do this together!
Rana: Don't be scared! (Traveler) and I are coming to get you right now!
Rana: Don't be silly! Stop saying that. Just stay still! You'll be okay!
Rana: Don't worry about me. Now let me catch my breath...
Rana: Don't worry about me... You guys go ahead.
Rana: Dummy... You didn't need to do that. Just thinking of you guys gives me energy...
Rana: Eh? Iotham! Wait up!
Rana: Eh? Oh... I'm fine, really... I just need to rest for a little while...
Rana: Ha... haha... it's fine. I just feel a little dizzy, that's all. And a little tired...
Rana: Hmph, I should be asking you that question! I'm a Forest Watcher here, and I'm in the middle of searching for a missing child. State your names!
Rana: Huh? So, these are the Fatui that Alphonso mentioned? State your business.
Rana: Hyah! Get out of Sumeru, you rascals!
Rana: I know. You'll become smart, healthy, and you'll know right from wrong... It's just like knowing which mushrooms you can eat, and which you can't...
Rana: I think I just saw him run into the cave.
Rana: I told him not to go running off...! Can you hear me, Iotham? Call out if you can!
Rana: I'm so glad you both could come with me. Still, I'll need to report the expansion of the nearby Withering Zone to Tighnari.
Rana: I'm sorry... (Traveler), Paimon, I need to rest... Wait for me, Iotham.
Rana: Iotham! Where are you?
Rana: Iotham, wait here and don't move! We're coming to rescue you!
Rana: Iotham, what was that green thing just now?
Rana: Iotham... Don't worry! I'm here with you! Even if I'm not here, (Traveler) will still be here for you!
Rana: Iotham... It's okay, little man, there's nothing to cry about. Look... If I can tell them about what I felt in the Withering Zone... to those Akademiya researchers... they'll be able to take care of The Withering for good...
Rana: Iotham... What happened...
Rana: Is that a Withering Zone? In a place like this?
Rana: It's nothing... I'll be fine. I'm a battle-hardened Forest Watcher, after all! Let's go!
Rana: It's on the tip of my tongue, but...
Rana: Know that Marana is bad, and... the forest is good... Become a strong and good person, help people who need help... just like (Traveler) and Paimon...
Rana: Looks like Alphonso wasn't kidding, these Fatui guys are dangerous...
Rana: Mm... How did I know that Marana is The Withering...? Dang it... everything's spinning...
Rana: No, no, it's fine... I just need... a little rest...
Rana: No... There's no time...
Rana: Really... How many times do I have to say it? I'm fine! But I'm very angry...
Rana: Really? Hehe, probably because you and Paimon were by my side.
Rana: Still, hahaha... the mushrooms here really are huge... They'd definitely taste great in a curry...
Rana: Thank goodness you were here, (Traveler)...
Rana: That's... The Withering.
Rana: This is... a kind of forest magic. It's also a kind of music... It's an Ara...
Rana: Ugh...
Rana: Urgh... I don't feel good...
Rana: Well, looks like we're not gonna be able to talk this one out!
Rana: Wh... What are you talking about? You're my little tiger, so no more crying! You're okay, aren't you? Does anything hurt, Iotham...? Do you feel dizzy, weak, or...
Rana: Whew... Hah... Finally...
Rana: Whew... Why are there still more coming...
Rana: You promised me... that you wouldn't go into the forest. Once I'm all rested up, I'll teach you a lesson about breaking promises... you little rascal...
You quickly explain what happened.
Your pursuit takes you back inside the cavern...
