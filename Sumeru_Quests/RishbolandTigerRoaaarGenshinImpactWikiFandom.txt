 Maybe later.
Arakanta: Okay, Arakanta will be waiting!
 Quest DescriptionSeems that Arakanta wants to play Rishboland Tiger and Aranara.
 Sure.
Arakanta: Hurray! Let's start!
 Why would the Rishboland Tiger chase Aranara?
Arakanta: Arakanta will summon a lot of Dendro particles, which are "Aranara" hiding in the circle. Nara is a big and powerful "Rishboland Tiger." Come and chase "Aranara"!
Arakanta: Arakanta's game is simple and fun! Listen to the rules, Nara...
Arakanta: Golden Nara, Arakanta has heard so much about you. You are a good Nara. Will you play with Arakanta?
Arakanta: Good? Nara willing to play game with Arakanta now?
Arakanta: Hurray! Let's start!
Arakanta: If the "Rishboland Tiger" catches all the Aranara in a short time, then Nara wins!
Arakanta: It is fun playing with other Aranara and real Rishboland Tigers, but playing with our new friend, our Nara friend, is even more fun!
Arakanta: Nara didn't win... But it's okay, Arakanta will play with Nara again!
Arakanta: Okay, Arakanta will be waiting!
Arakanta: So much fun! Arakanta is very happy playing games with Golden Nara! And Nara is so fast! So amazing! Like a real tiger!
Arakanta: Thank you, Nara! Arakanta is so happy!
Arakanta: Thank you, Nara. Here is an Aranara flower for Golden Nara!
Arakanta: The Rishboland Tiger and Aranara are friends, and friends play together. But Arakanta noticed that Nara are afraid of the Rishboland Tiger. That's why Arakanta came up with a new game for Festival Utsava!
