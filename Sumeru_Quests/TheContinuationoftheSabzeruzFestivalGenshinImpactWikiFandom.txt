(Multiple boxes are briefly focused on)
 (Alert)
 ...
 A gang of kidnappers had just ambushed you.
 Actually, I also noticed something else.
 Break out of this cycle...?
 But I'm not sure if it's related to your divination.
 But how would it do that...?
 Come with me. I'll show you some evidence.
 Do you ever feel like you're reliving the same day?
 Doubt it...
 Have you felt anything strange lately?
 Haven't you noticed something off about Dunyarzad?
 Hmm... Let me collect my thoughts...
 I feel like at the end of every day...
 I heard the same sound in Port Ormos.
 I know; you introduced yourself before.
 It's worth a shot.
 Just now, that was...
 Let's try taking her to see the real Dunyarzad.
 Let's try talking to Dehya again.
 Let's use it together, Paimon.
 Memories!
 Most information in the Akasha comes from Irminsul.
 Nahida, can you tell us anything about the Akasha?
 No one dreams in Sumeru.
 Number five is Onikabuto.
 Number four.
 Number one is Lizard Tail.
 Number three is Lavender Melon.
 Number two is Harra Fruit.
 Over there.
 Quest DescriptionYou come to attend today's Sabzeruz Festival, but you are haunted by a lingering sense of déjà vu...
 Remember what he said just now...
 She cares a lot about Dunyarzad...
 She was still with us just a moment ago...
 So many days' worth of memories...
 Somehow, I don't think it'll be that simple.
 There is always the sound of a beep.
 This feels... all too familiar.
 We actually did run into a situation.
 We're all trapped in the day of the Sabzeruz Festival.
 What I need to do right now is...
 What a strong sense of déjà vu...
 What!?
 What's up?
 What's wrong with the Dunyarzad over there...?
 You got injured because you aren't used to your current greatsword.
 You just defeated a gang of kidnappers.
 You sold your greatsword to support the festival.
 You've actually divined our fortune many, many times.
 Y—You can see her?

After touching the Knowledge Capsule, countless memories resurface in your mind.

Everyone removes their Akasha Terminals...
Everything is so familiar that you feel at a loss...
Media:Akasha Terminal Beep.ogg ???: *beep*
Media:vo dialog xmaq008 guard 01.ogg Media:vo dialog xmaq008 guard 02.ogg Guard: Hey! Stop right there! No one is allowed to enter or leave Sumeru City right now. Go away!
Media:vo dialog xmaq008 merchant 01.ogg Merchant: *sigh* How am I supposed to conduct business when I'm not allowed to leave the city?
Media:vo dialog xmaq008 paimon 01.ogg Media:vo dialog xmaq008 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whoa... Ugh, okay.
(The player is teleported a few steps back into the city)
Media:vo dialog xmaq009 amal 01.ogg Amal: I picked all of these from the forest yesterday, so their freshness is guaranteed!
Media:vo dialog xmaq009 kimiya 01.ogg Kimiya: This is divine wisdom...
Media:vo dialog xmaq009 vihar 01.ogg Vihar: Atten-tion! Any more requests, young soldiers?
Media:vo dialog xmaq010 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: You all seem to have a matter to attend to. Don't worry about me. I'll be sitting here.
Media:vo dialog xmaq010 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: We don't have many more festivals to waste. Hurry and find the truth.
Media:vo xmaq010 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: *yawn* Why does Paimon feel so tired after so much sleep?
Media:vo xmaq010 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Anyway, we should go meet Dunyarzad right away.
Media:vo xmaq010 10 azar 01.ogg ???: But... we cannot lose all of our progress.
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: The real Dunyarzad? ...Where? And who are you talking to?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Hold on... Over there, is that...
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Miss Dunyarzad... she's lying down here, isn't she? How's she doing?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: I can sense her aura... There are also lingering feelings of something like regret or disappointment. What happened...?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: Yeah. They've always been against us. It wouldn't surprise me if they're using the Akasha to intentionally repeat the Sabzeruz Festival as a sick joke.
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: So, this Nahida you mentioned... What did she say?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: Compiles the wisdom of the entire populace, and grants knowledge to the people... Wait...
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: I get the "grants knowledge" part — that's what people have always used the Akasha for. But compiling the entire populace's wisdom? How does that work?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: You mean... The Akasha is causing our mental fatigue? Now that I think about it, my head's been feeling unusually heavy.
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: When the desert-dwellers set off on their quest for knowledge, a sage once said, "Knowledge always comes at a price."
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 11.ogg Dehya: Compiling the entire country's knowledge...You think the Akasha pulled a 180 and is extracting information from us?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 12.ogg Dehya: Who knows? The Akasha can put knowledge into our heads, so who's to say that it can't also poke around in there? We don't know any specifics.
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 13.ogg Dehya: Just think about it... If you could combine the knowledge of every single person in Sumeru, then you can basically turn Sumeru City into a single, massive brain...
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 14.ogg Dehya: ...This hivemind could make breakthroughs in problems that even the smartest geniuses can't crack.
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 15.ogg Dehya: Yeah. I was only wearing this for show in the first place. Didn't expect the Sages to cook up such a conspiracy... Mark my words, when this is over, I'm getting evidence and exposing this whole thing to the public!
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 16.ogg Dehya: The sound of a beep... Could it be a prompt tone for when the Akasha is operating?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 17.ogg Dehya: I heard it, too! Our ears aren't messing with us. There was definitely a beep, but it sounded like it was coming from inside my head!
Media:vo xmaq010 10 dehya 18.ogg Dehya: We took off our Akasha Terminals... How...?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 hero 02.ogg Media:vo xmaq010 10 heroine 02.ogg (Traveler): What's happening right now seems to have happened before. This feeling has been getting stronger and stronger...
Media:vo xmaq010 10 hero 04.ogg Media:vo xmaq010 10 heroine 04.ogg (Traveler): Dehya sold her greatsword to raise additional funds, and then she was injured because she wasn't used to her new weapon.
Media:vo xmaq010 10 hero 17.ogg Media:vo xmaq010 10 heroine 17.ogg (Traveler): That should be it... The flow of time is endlessly cycling within one single day.
Media:vo xmaq010 10 khajeh 01.ogg ???: Phase runtime has exceeded its expected length. At this rate, there may be casualties...
Media:vo xmaq010 10 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: ...I thought I told you that it won't help to bring anyone here.
Media:vo xmaq010 10 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: *sigh* I told you that you two are special. Other people can't see me or Miss Dunyarzad here.
Media:vo xmaq010 10 nahida 03.ogg Nahida: Wow, how perceptive... Does she have invisible antennae?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: The Akasha relies on the power of a Gnosis to operate, as it is the manifestation of the God of Wisdom's power. It compiles the wisdom of the entire populace, and it grants knowledge to the people.
Media:vo xmaq010 10 nahida 05.ogg Nahida: An excellent deduction. And the analogy comparing Sumeru City to a massive brain? Ahh, I love it.
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Nahida, we brought a friend. Are you busy?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We just wanted her to see the real Dunyarzad's condition...
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Her condition's really bad, and she's basically in a coma. How did you know she was here?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Do you believe us now? The Sabzeruz Festival has been repeating itself...
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: ...So you think the sages are behind this?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Hmm, you have a point... Aside from the Dendro Archon, the Akademiya's sages are the only ones in Sumeru who could pull off something like this.
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Maybe there's more to the Akasha than we know?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Right! Didn't you awaken our memories using something that looked like a Knowledge Capsule? That means you must know something about the Akasha!
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: A Gnosis can do that!? No wonder the Akasha is so magical — it's being powered by the Gnosis of Sumeru's Archon.
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: She said, and Paimon quotes: "The Akasha relies on the power of a Gnosis to operate, as it is the manifestation of the God of Wisdom's power. It compiles the wisdom of the entire populace, and it grants knowledge to the people."
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Did she mean that the sages enter new knowledge into the Akasha?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Oh yeah, that sounds about right. What do you think?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: What's the point of doing something like that?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: In that case, we should take off our Akasha Terminals right away! Maybe that'll solve this problem?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: How does everyone feel?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Huh? What is it?
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Oh, that! Paimon knows what you're talking about! It's a single, soft beep that sounds like it's coming from the Akasha Terminal.
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: That's probably an important clue. We weren't using our terminals, but we heard a beep anyway...
Media:vo xmaq010 10 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: Traveler, did you hear that!?
Media:vo xmaq010 2 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: Not at all. I arrived early.
Media:vo xmaq010 2 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: I'm doing well. There's no need to worry. Shall we go? Let's start with the stalls over there.
Media:vo xmaq010 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Good morning, Dunyarzad! Sorry to keep you waiting.
Media:vo xmaq010 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? Paimon thinks you sound kinda tired... Did you not get enough sleep?
Media:vo xmaq010 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Great idea! Let's get going. Traveler... Uh, hey, Traveler?
Media:vo xmaq010 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm, not much of a choice... All these boxes look the same.
Media:vo xmaq010 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hm-hmm~ They all sound pretty tasty.
Media:vo xmaq010 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh!? What were those last two!?
Media:vo xmaq010 3 paimon 04a.ogg Media:vo xmaq010 3 paimon 04b.ogg Paimon: Hmm... (He/She)'ll help me choose. Paimon wants the Sunsettia flavor!
Media:vo xmaq010 3 paimon 05a.ogg Media:vo xmaq010 3 paimon 05b.ogg Paimon: Haha, Paimon knew (he/she) always had incredible luck!
Media:vo xmaq010 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Umm, Paimon's not really interested in the other flavors.
Media:vo xmaq010 3 paimon 07a.ogg Media:vo xmaq010 3 paimon 07b.ogg Paimon: What? (He/She) was right about all of them?
Media:vo xmaq010 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Tell us what's going on! Since when did you get superpowers... Traveler?
Media:vo xmaq010 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Hey! Where are you going?
Media:vo xmaq010 3 vihar 01.ogg Vihar: Haha, it's all thanks to Miss Dunyarzad's sponsorship that the children can enjoy the Sabzeruz Festival.
Media:vo xmaq010 3 vihar 02.ogg Vihar: Oh, are you interested in Yalda Candies? I have some boxes of candy here. Pick whichever one you want.
Media:vo xmaq010 3 vihar 03.ogg Vihar: Haha, it's not that simple. Each box contains a random flavor — it's up to the luck of the draw. Flavors include Lavender Melon, Harra Fruit, Sunsettia...
Media:vo xmaq010 3 vihar 04.ogg Vihar: ...And there's also Lizard Tail and Onikabuto.
Media:vo xmaq010 3 vihar 05.ogg Vihar: No problem. These boxes of candy are numbered one to five from left to right. Which one do you want?
Media:vo xmaq010 3 vihar 06.ogg Vihar: Oho? I like your confidence — no hesitation at all. Ah, congratulations! Number four is indeed Sunsettia.
Media:vo xmaq010 3 vihar 07.ogg Vihar: Ah... W—Wait, how did you know? Don't tell me that you already knew which flavor was in each box?
Media:vo xmaq010 3 vihar 08.ogg Vihar: That couldn't have been luck. H—How is this possible? I packed all those boxes this morning, and they've been sealed ever since. You couldn't have known beforehand.
Media:vo xmaq010 3 vihar 09.ogg Vihar: ...Mind reading? X-ray vision? Or some kind of magic trick? This is way too freaky...
Media:vo xmaq010 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What's going on? Did you see something?
Media:vo xmaq010 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Us leaving Dunyarzad without letting her know is kinda rude, you know.
Media:vo xmaq010 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What are you looking for? Why did we come here?
Media:vo xmaq010 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Traveler?
Media:vo xmaq010 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: That's...
Media:vo xmaq010 6 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: *cough* *cough*
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 01.ogg ???: You already know that this isn't your first Sabzeruz Festival, don't you?
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 02.ogg ???: I'm sure you already know how to use this.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 03.ogg ???: You should use it too, Paimon.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 04.ogg ???: Your memories are still scrambled? Try your best to remember. This isn't the first time we've met, and I answered that question a long time ago.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 05.ogg ???: Your sense of déjà vu is stronger than everyone else's, yes? As for an explanation... You two received the blessing of Dendro, and you also have special, sensitive constitutions.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 06.ogg ???: It was as if a single sheet of paper was separating those memories from your consciousness.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 07.ogg ???: A familiar question. I think this is the seventh time you asked that.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 08.ogg ???: As you can see, she isn't doing well. You probably sensed it, too — the Dunyarzad you were just with is different from the first Dunyarzad you met.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 09.ogg ???: That "first" Dunyarzad is in front of you right now, and... she doesn't have a lot of time left.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 10.ogg ???: Hehe, looks like you're almost done sorting out your brain.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 11.ogg Nahida: Oh yeah, I'm Nahida.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 12.ogg Nahida: Good, you passed the test.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 13.ogg Nahida: Everything in this world runs in a loop... This cycle is called a "samsara." You, me, and everyone else are all stuck inside a one-day samsara...
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 14.ogg Nahida: As for the truth... That's on you to find out. If you were told the truth instead of discovering it yourselves... It would literally blow your minds. I don't know how you'd be after that.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 15.ogg Nahida: I can only give you surface-level help, like bits of information and subtle hints. For the rest of the time, I'll be doing all I can to slow down Dunyarzad's illness.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 16.ogg Nahida: If we can break out of this samsara, I might be able to save her.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 17.ogg Nahida: ...But as things are right now, she's just a small bird in the sky that's about to lose its last feathers. All I can do is raise a gale to delay her fall.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 18.ogg Nahida: Analogies are wonderful tools. They let you use existing knowledge to understand unfamiliar things.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 19.ogg Nahida: Okay, so... With what you know so far, what do you think the truth is?
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 20.ogg Nahida: A time loop... *sigh* You've given similarly wrong answers in the past. A pity.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 21.ogg Nahida: A simple time loop can't explain some of the phenomena. You two are still missing a lot of information. Unfortunately, I can't give you any more hints...
Media:vo xmaq010 6 nahida 22.ogg Nahida: The Sabzeruz Festival is happening every day, but that doesn't mean we can waste an infinite amount of them. Hurry and find the truth before today's festival ends.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Look! That's... Isn't that Dunyarzad!?
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What's happening here? Why are there two Dunyarzads?
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: A Knowledge Capsule? Where did you get it...? What's inside?
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Ah... Y—You know Paimon?
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: ...Well, this seems kinda sketchy, but... Paimon feels like this is what we should do.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: W—What the!?
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: This is our twentieth time at the Sabzeruz Festival? Hmm, no... The thirtieth? Fortieth? Just how many times have we been to the Sabzeruz Festival?
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Have we been trapped in a single day? If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have even realized...
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: What the heck was inside that Knowledge Capsule?
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Uhh... Let Paimon think... Ohh, it's coming back... Meeting you was the real catalyst for restoring our memories, and... the Knowledge Capsule was just your means of showing our minds the way...
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: What about everyone else? Why are you only helping the two of us?
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: What's happening...? You can awaken our memories, and you seem like you know what's going on... Wait, please don't tell Paimon even you don't know!
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: She looks like she isn't doing well at all... Her illness gets worse after each Sabzeruz Festival...
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: You sure love to use weird analogies.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Still the wrong answer... Paimon thought that made a lot of sense! It feels like time's just repeating itself.
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Dunyarzad...
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Let's think about our current situation... To save Dunyarzad, we have to escape the samsara of the Sabzeruz Festival...
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: And to do that, we need to figure out what's happening — the "truth"...
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: Nahida rejected the idea of a time loop, so we must have missed something, right?
Media:vo xmaq010 6 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: Paimon's memories say that we've already done this many times, but... let's go talk to people again. It's more productive than sitting here and scratching our heads... Why don't we start with... those stall owners?
Media:vo xmaq010 7 amal 01.ogg Amal: Hey, it's you guys again. Where's your cultured friend?
Media:vo xmaq010 7 amal 02.ogg Amal: I see. Did you come back to buy something? I guarantee the freshness of my products. I harvested them from the forest just yesterday.
Media:vo xmaq010 7 amal 03.ogg Amal: Huh? What brought this about? I hurried back from the forest yesterday, and I'm selling produce here today. I haven't felt anything strange.
Media:vo xmaq010 7 amal 04.ogg Amal: What kind of philosophical nonsense is this? Are you two daydreaming?
Media:vo xmaq010 7 amal 05.ogg Amal: Didn't you know that no one dreams in Sumeru? Go somewhere else if you want to find someone to daydream with, hahaha...
Media:vo xmaq010 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey there!
Media:vo xmaq010 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: She... She's feeling a little unwell.
Media:vo xmaq010 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm... To put it another way, if you really, really think about it, was "yesterday" truly "yesterday"? Did you actually come back from the forest yesterday?
Media:vo xmaq010 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Ugh... He actually has a point. Is this a dream? Is everyone dreaming?
Media:vo xmaq010 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hm, true. It's so weird that people here don't dream! Why is that?
Media:vo xmaq010 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Anyway, if this all really were just a dream, we would've woken up a long time ago. Let's keep asking around.
Media:vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 01.ogg Kimiya: Oh, it's you two! Was my divination so accurate that you felt compelled to compliment me in person?
Media:vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 02.ogg Kimiya: Oooh, I knew it! I told you, the gods' divination is highly accurate. You just hadn't fully understood its significance yet. Hahaha...
Media:vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 03.ogg Kimiya: Er... Help you better understand it...? W—Well, that isn't exactly what I excel at...
Media:vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 04.ogg Kimiya: Anyway, what kind of situation did you get into?
Media:vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 05.ogg Kimiya: Huh? Hold on a second... I thought you guys just lost your wallet or fell for a scam...
Media:vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 06.ogg Kimiya: What you just said... Are you serious? Does that kind of thing actually happen in real life?
Media:vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 07.ogg Kimiya: Marvelous, truly marvelous... I believe you. Recall the interpretation of your divination... The Moon, illusions, and lies... It really felt like an omen.
Media:vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 08.ogg Kimiya: I believe that the Archon's revelations are never more than vague hints. Anything more specific is beyond the reach of mere mortals.
Media:vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 09.ogg Kimiya: The book only says, "If you trust your instincts and overcome your fears, the sun will surely rise."
Media:vo xmaq010 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: You're really excited about this, huh... That's exactly why we came back. Help us better understand it!
Media:vo xmaq010 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So you're admitting that you don't have a clue?
Media:vo xmaq010 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Paimon knew you weren't going to believe it!
Media:vo xmaq010 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: When you say it like that, the divination does sound like it's related to what's going on. Can you read any more into it?
Media:vo xmaq010 8 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So that's how it is... Looks like fortune-telling is just fortune-telling — it's no good for practical problems.
Media:vo xmaq010 8 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: We haven't made any progress. Who else can we talk to?
Media:vo xmaq010 8 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Hm, Paimon remembers that we've tried talking to her a couple of times, but she always thinks that we're playing pranks on her. You think she'll brush us off again?
Media:vo xmaq010 8 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Yeah... If we tap into Dehya's strong sense of responsibility as a mercenary, then she'll definitely take us seriously.
Media:vo xmaq010 8 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: At this time of day, Dehya's probably just finished beating up those kidnappers. Let's go find her!
Media:vo xmaq010 9 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: ...I'm fine, my lady. It's just a scratch.
Media:vo xmaq010 9 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Paimon, Traveler, you came at just the right time! Listen, there was a dangerous—
Media:vo xmaq010 9 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Huh, you saw? Then why didn't you jump in earlier? If someone was protecting Miss Dunyarzad, I could've went all-out. Anyway, can you do something for me?
Media:vo xmaq010 9 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: ...How did you know what I was going to say?
Media:vo xmaq010 9 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: ...
Media:vo xmaq010 9 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: I didn't tell anyone about that, including Miss Dunyarzad. You couldn't have known... And just now, you literally took the words right out of my mouth. What's going on?
Media:vo xmaq010 9 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: It's kinda hard to believe what you just told me... First, let me make something clear: Most of us desert-dwellers might not be the scholarly type, but we do have basic common sense...
Media:vo xmaq010 9 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: Yeah, she isn't the same as before, but...
Media:vo xmaq010 9 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: ...Her parents said that this is how she was like at first.
Media:vo xmaq010 9 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: My lady... Are you angry...?
Media:vo xmaq010 9 dehya 11.ogg Dehya: ...Alright. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt since you knew about my greatsword. Let's make this a quick trip — Miss Dunyarzad isn't completely safe here.
Media:vo xmaq010 9 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: I don't quite understand what you are all talking about. I'll go rest on the bench over there.
Media:vo xmaq010 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Perfect timing! Both of you are here.
Media:vo xmaq010 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: You want the Traveler to take Dunyarzad somewhere to rest up while you check to see if there are still any kidnappers around. Did Paimon get that right?
Media:vo xmaq010 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We need to say something convincing...
Media:vo xmaq010 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Tell her, Traveler!
Media:vo xmaq010 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Alright, so this is the situation...
Media:vo xmaq010 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: She's quieter than usual, uninterested in anything, and really gloomy...
Media:vo xmaq010 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Eh? At first?
Media:vo xmaq013 10 hero 01.ogg Media:vo xmaq013 10 heroine 01.ogg (Traveler): The Moon, illusions, and lies... What do they all mean?
Media:vo xmaq013 10 hero 03.ogg Media:vo xmaq013 10 heroine 03.ogg (Traveler): The Grand Sage said, "Go celebrate the birth of that god to your heart's content." Did he mean something more?
Media:vo xmaq013 10 hero 05.ogg Media:vo xmaq013 10 heroine 05.ogg (Traveler): My mind feels exhausted, even though I haven't done too much thinking. What is going on?
Media:vo xmaq013 10 hero 06.ogg Media:vo xmaq013 10 heroine 06.ogg (Traveler): We've already experienced the Sabzeruz Festival many times. And... the day of the festival seems to be in a perpetual samsara.
Media:vo xmaq013 10 hero 07.ogg Media:vo xmaq013 10 heroine 07.ogg (Traveler): People in Sumeru don't dream. What a strange phenomenon.
Media:vo xmaq013 10 hero 08.ogg Media:vo xmaq013 10 heroine 08.ogg (Traveler): Okay, Nahida said, "The Akasha relies on the power of a Gnosis to operate, as it is the manifestation of the God of Wisdom's power. It compiles the wisdom of the entire populace, and it grants knowledge to the people."
Media:vo xmaq013 10 hero 23.ogg Media:vo xmaq013 10 heroine 23.ogg (Traveler): That doesn't sound right... I need to carefully think things through...
Media:vo xmaq013 10 hero 24.ogg Media:vo xmaq013 10 heroine 24.ogg (Traveler): Hmm... I can't seem to cohesively piece everything together.
