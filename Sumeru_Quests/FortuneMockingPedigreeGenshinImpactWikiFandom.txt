 ...What happened to his mother?
 ...While you were afflicted by this curse instead?
 A Crafting Bench?
 A hilichurl?
 A mushroom?
 Agh!
 Alright, don't get too worked up...
 Anything?
 But though the curse denies you even this...
 Calm down, Eide.
 Eide, stop...
 Eide, the medicine's ready.
 Excuse me?
 Fine.
 Got it.
 He left the house?
 Hey, stop daydreaming...
 I don't think I'll have much luck trying to find my companion in the woods...
 I follow no god. In fact, I count some of them as my foes.
 I follow no god. Though I count some of them as my friends.
 I know this must cause you great pain.
 I take it that's how you've survived for so long?
 I think I'm better off waiting here for them to come back.
 I understand your reluctance.
 I understand. No matter what, you have to try.
 I was out here all night. I'm cold.
 I'll keep helping you.
 I'm just a traveler.
 Your clothes...
 Your eyes...
 I'm no villain.
 I'm only here to look for my traveling companion.
 I'm sorry...
 I've met others from Khaenri'ah.
 Your clothes...
 Your eyes...
 I've never seen a mushroom of this kind before...
 I've picked some before, yes.
 Is it time to give Caribert the medicine?
 It didn't work.
 It sounds dangerous...
 May I join you?
 No, but I can go out and get some.
 Nor will I pretend to be a saint.
 Of course...
 Or maybe it takes a full course of treatment.
 Ouch... that can't be easy for someone from Khaenri'ah...
 Quest DescriptionAs night passes and you awaken next to the bonfire, you realize that Paimon is missing. As you search for her, you come upon a wandering father by chance...
 Recover his clarity of mind?
 Relax. I've been around, it takes a lot to faze me.
 So why did some people turn into hilichurls...
 So you mean to say that...
 So... who is this hilichurl to you?
 Spoken like a true Khaenri'ahn.
 Such as... who knows, perhaps the dosage was too low.
 That sounds a little too black-and-white.
 That's the spirit.
 There might be other reasons it didn't work.
 Things will get better.
 Unless you are ready to give up on Caribert...
 Wait, in a field? Like a crop?
 What are you going to use this for?
 What do you plan to do now?
 What is the curse of immortality, exactly?
 What were you planning to do around here?
 What!?
 Where did you get those mushrooms from, anyway?
 Where did you hear of this?
 Whoa, whoa... Just calm down.
 Why do you keep a hilichurl at home?
 You have to exhaust all options...
 You know, there must've been a reason it was banned...
 You startled me!
 You still have Caribert.
 You were nearby last night?
 You're... from Khaenri'ah, aren't you?
 Your clothes...
 Your eyes...
 Your secret is safe with me.
(Traveler):  (There's something strange about this person. I need to find out what he's hiding...)
(Traveler):  ...
(Traveler): (...Forget it. Eide hates the gods — it could complicate things. I'll just do it his way.)
(Traveler): (Does watering the field somehow attract monsters? Hmm, better fend them off.)
(Traveler): (I may not know the whole truth behind the cataclysm, but the people of Khaenri'ah have truly suffered...)
(Traveler): (I thought so... Still, I don't know if I can trust this person's word just yet.)
(Traveler): (Monsters! And so many of them... It looks like they're coming for this field...)
(Traveler): (Since he needs the God of Wisdom's power, should I get Nahida to help?)
(Traveler): (So Eide is just like Dain, someone who bears the curse of immortality.)
(Traveler): (The hilichurl seems almost lifeless. Its reactions to everything are incredibly weak...)
(Traveler): (To have infinite time, yet no hope... can only be called torture.)
(Traveler): (When we were in The Chasm, Dain said that the curse could not be undone... Is recovery really possible?)
(Traveler): (Why could Khaenri'ah and The Seven not coexist in peace?)
(Traveler): ...
Caribert: ...
Eide carefully waters his field...
Eide spreads the fertilizer evenly. Before long, the elemental energy within starts to take effect...

Media:vo dialog szaq202 eide 03.ogg Eide: Please fetch the water. I'll be waiting here.
Media:vo dialog szaq202 eide 04.ogg Eide: *sigh* I suppose I will soon have to visit the Statue of The Seven once more...
Media:vo dialog szaq202 fateh 01.ogg Fateh: You scholars and your big words... You know what would really impress me? Fixing the humidity in this forest...
Media:vo dialog szaq202 fateh 02.ogg Fateh: My whole family's having a hard time with this climate... Seriously, all my old injuries are acting up.
Media:vo dialog szaq202 hajjan 01.ogg Hajjan: The ecological issues in this area require further observation and analysis...
Media:vo szaq202 10 eide 01.ogg Eide: Is it done? Splendid, let me see...
Media:vo szaq202 10 eide 02.ogg Eide: Hmm. In all honesty, I do not know what the end product is supposed to look like. The banned book didn't feature any illustrations...
Media:vo szaq202 10 eide 03.ogg Eide: ...Well, the moment has finally arrived... Curses.
Media:vo szaq202 10 eide 04.ogg Eide: No, no. We need to perform one final step to complete the medicine.
Media:vo szaq202 10 eide 05.ogg Eide: I said before that this medicine relies on the power of the God of Wisdom for its restorative effects...
Media:vo szaq202 10 eide 06.ogg Eide: Which means... we must pay a visit to a Statue of The Seven.
Media:vo szaq202 10 eide 07.ogg Eide: Let's go. Bring the medicine with you.
Media:vo szaq202 11 eide 01.ogg Eide: Look at this statue... How can I bow before this thing...
Media:vo szaq202 11 eide 02.ogg Eide: God of Wisdom. Look at me.
Media:vo szaq202 11 eide 03.ogg Eide: I will utter no prayer, nor will I sing your praises.
Media:vo szaq202 11 eide 04.ogg Eide: You and your kind destroyed my home, wrought unfathomable suffering on my compatriots... Yet here I stand before you.
Media:vo szaq202 11 eide 05.ogg Eide: You cannot mock me more than fate itself already has.
Media:vo szaq202 11 eide 06.ogg Eide: God of Wisdom, I seek not to disavow myself of the sinful blood that flows through my veins. I wish only to beseech you to have pity upon a young and unfortunate soul.
Media:vo szaq202 11 eide 07.ogg Eide: My son, Caribert... He was turned into a monster before he had the chance to witness anything beautiful in this world... This is no fate for a child.
Media:vo szaq202 11 eide 08.ogg Eide: ...
Media:vo szaq202 11 eide 09.ogg Eide: If everything the gods have done was in order to have the impious people of Khaenri'ah bow their heads...
Media:vo szaq202 11 eide 10.ogg Eide: Then... I bow to you now.
Media:vo szaq202 11 eide 11.ogg Eide: I have given up all I ever stood for...
Media:vo szaq202 11 eide 12.ogg Eide: All I ask for is a tiny miracle. For Caribert to see this world once more.
Media:vo szaq202 11 eide 13.ogg Eide: Please, god... I beg of you.
Media:vo szaq202 11 eide 14.ogg Eide: I have made quite enough of a fool of myself for one day. Let's go.
Media:vo szaq202 11 eide 15.ogg Eide: ...Hm.
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 01.ogg Eide: Caribert?
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 02.ogg Eide: Well, we've prepared the medicine. We might as well try it.
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 03.ogg Eide: Caribert? It's me... It's your father. Caribert?
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 04.ogg Eide: Caribert... Please, say something.
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 05.ogg Eide: I'm sorry I couldn't be at your side when you were born... and that I failed to reach you and mama in time when you both were suffering...
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 06.ogg Eide: But I'm here now. Papa's been by your side all these years. I've never left you. Not once.
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 07.ogg Eide: Are you still angry with me, Caribert?
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 08.ogg Eide: I know you're awake now... Do you not want to talk to me?
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 09.ogg Eide: I'm so sorry, Caribert. Forgive me, please! Say something. Anything!
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 10.ogg Eide: Please... please...
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 11.ogg Eide: Aah!
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 12.ogg Eide: Gods above! What more do you want from me!?
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 13.ogg Eide: You took everything from here, and still I bowed to you!
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 14.ogg Eide: I'd give you my very life if only you cared to take it! But you won't even let me die!
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 15.ogg Eide: ...I knew it. I should never have trusted anything that had to do with the gods. I was just deluding myself...
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 16.ogg Eide: The gods of this world have never stood with humanity... Not even for a moment!
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 17.ogg Eide: Other reasons... What do you mean?
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 18.ogg Eide: Huh... you really think so...?
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 19.ogg Eide: Give up? No, no. Never! ...Yes, you're right. I cannot let myself wallow in despair.
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 20.ogg Eide: Even if I must stay here with him for... fifty years? A hundred? What difference does it make? I do not lack for time...
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 21.ogg Eide: Let's go. We'll make another dose.
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 22.ogg Eide: The most crucial ingredient in this medicine is the unusual mushroom, which makes things complicated... but not impossible.
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 23.ogg Eide: I grow them. In that field.
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 24.ogg Eide: ...The details don't matter, right? Curb your curiosity and just do as I instruct — if you truly wish to help me, that is how you can do it.
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 25.ogg Eide: There is a waterfall near the statue I prayed at. I need you to collect some water from there around two in the afternoon.
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 26.ogg Eide: I'll be here watching Caribert. Once you're back, I will make some fertilizer for the mushrooms.
Media:vo szaq202 12 eide 27.ogg Eide: Good. Then please head over when the time comes.
Media:vo szaq202 14 eide 01.ogg Eide: Ah, you're back. Caribert's condition is stable...
Media:vo szaq202 14 eide 02.ogg Eide: By which I mean... he still isn't responding.
Media:vo szaq202 14 eide 03.ogg Eide: Anyway. Give me the water.

Media:vo szaq202 14 eide 04.ogg Eide: I need you to stand guard here for a while. Whatever you do, don't let any Forest Rangers approach the house. Understand?
Media:vo szaq202 14 eide 05.ogg Eide: Good. I'll be back soon, the fertilizer won't take but a moment to make.
Media:vo szaq202 15 eide 01.ogg Eide: What happened? Was it monsters?
Media:vo szaq202 15 eide 02.ogg Eide: Thank goodness you were here. I couldn't have taken them on all by myself... I'd have had to hide and wait until they were gone.
Media:vo szaq202 15 eide 03.ogg Eide: Oh yes — I've got the fertilizer. The effects can take some time to kick in, so let's get on with it.
Media:vo szaq202 15 eide 04.ogg Eide: Next, we pick the mushrooms and repeat the same steps as before to make another dose. I trust you still remember the method?
Media:vo szaq202 17 eide 01.ogg Eide: ...
Media:vo szaq202 17 eide 02.ogg Eide: Oh! Uh, sorry, I just... After resting in this field for a while, my thoughts began to wander...
Media:vo szaq202 17 eide 03.ogg Eide: I have been so very weary, for many years... if only I could fall asleep here in this field, and never wake up again...
Media:vo szaq202 17 eide 04.ogg Eide: Hehe, I do indeed, that's why it was just a fleeting thought... Thank you for your help once again. Now for the final step... Back to the Statue of The Seven.
Media:vo szaq202 18 eide 01.ogg Eide: We're here. Let's begin...
(Eide notices a Hilichurl walking below)
Media:vo szaq202 18 eide 02.ogg Eide: Wait a moment... Hey, what was that? ...Caribert?
Media:vo szaq202 18 eide 03.ogg Eide: Oh no... He must have left while we were too busy preparing the medicine to notice...
Media:vo szaq202 18 eide 04.ogg Eide: Come on! We have to catch up with him!
Media:vo szaq202 2 eide 01.ogg Intimidating Man: Halt! What do you think you're doing!?
Media:vo szaq202 2 eide 02.ogg Intimidating Man: This place is not whatever you think it is... Nor should you be poking your nose into my business! Begone!
Media:vo szaq202 2 eide 03.ogg Intimidating Man: Your travel companion? ...You mean the one that was keeping watch by your side last night?
Media:vo szaq202 2 eide 04.ogg Intimidating Man: Your companion departed for the forest early this morning. That much I saw with my own eyes.
Media:vo szaq202 2 eide 05.ogg Intimidating Man: What business is that of yours? All you need to know is that I claimed this place first — and what I do here is none of your concern.
Media:vo szaq202 2 eide 06.ogg Intimidating Man: Do I make myself quite clear? Leave!
Media:vo szaq202 2 eide 07.ogg Intimidating Man: Well? What are you waiting for?
Media:vo szaq202 2 eide 08.ogg Intimidating Man: *sigh* If you must... Suit yourself.
Media:vo szaq202 2 eide 09.ogg Intimidating Man: I've been observing you, and you don't look like a Forest Ranger, nor someone from the Akademiya.
Media:vo szaq202 2 eide 10.ogg Intimidating Man: Still, I'm warning you, no funny business. Promise me that, and you can do as you please.
Media:vo szaq202 2 eide 11.ogg Intimidating Man: Okay, fine, whatever... Move aside. I'm heading in.
Media:vo szaq202 2 eide 12.ogg Intimidating Man: You...
Media:vo szaq202 2 eide 13.ogg Intimidating Man: *sigh* Oh, go on then, have it your way. I knew I wasn't going to be able to hide this anyway. Just come in.
Media:vo szaq202 2 eide 14.ogg Intimidating Man: But no overreacting to anything you see in here, okay? You understand me?
Media:vo szaq202 2 eide 15.ogg Intimidating Man: Come on, then.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 01.ogg Intimidating Man: Mind your own business. Don't worry, he isn't aggressive...
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 02.ogg Intimidating Man: ...How could he be. He was too young for anything like that.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 03.ogg Intimidating Man: So don't you lay a finger on him. Just find yourself a corner to rest if you're tired or cold.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 04.ogg Intimidating Man: Huh?
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 05.ogg Intimidating Man: You know Khaenri'ah... Who are you, exactly? And how do you know I'm from Khaenri'ah?
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 06.ogg Intimidating Man: ...
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 07.ogg Intimidating Man: Do you worship a god, Traveler?
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 08.ogg Eide: ...Sounds like you've had an eventful life. Alright, well... my name is Eide. And you are correct — I was once Khaenri'ahn.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 09.ogg Eide: I apologize for my earlier hostility. But you must understand... As far as I'm concerned, humans who do not worship The Seven are nigh extinct...
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 10.ogg Eide: ...And all who place faith in the gods are my enemies.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 11.ogg Eide: ...That may be, but the fact is that chances to talk to people like yourself have been few and far between since the cataclysm.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 12.ogg Eide: This wretched curse of immortality... Who knows how long I must continue to suffer like this?
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 13.ogg Eide: The curse? Huh, it was a little gift given to the people of Khaenri'ah by those vile gods...
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 14.ogg Eide: We lost our home, our loved ones, everything... The agony of the cataclysm itself was already too much to bear... but then came the curse, robbing us any chance of release.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 15.ogg Eide: All we can do is watch helplessly as our souls erode and our bodies decay.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 16.ogg Eide: Because although Khaenri'ah began with a single bloodline, it was a home to others, too...
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 17.ogg Eide: Any who forsook their gods and came to Khaenri'ah were welcomed as our fellow citizens.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 18.ogg Eide: When the cataclysm came, we pure-blood Khaenri'ahns were declared the "greater sinners." Upon us, the gods placed the curse of immortality...
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 19.ogg Eide: But those whose ancestry belonged to the domains of other gods were punished with the curse of the wilderness as they fled, turning them into monsters.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 20.ogg Eide: He is Caribert... my illegitimate son.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 21.ogg Eide: *sigh* How times have changed. I can say that out loud with no consequence now, but... it was once a matter of unspeakable shame.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 22.ogg Eide: I was a noble of Khaenri'ah... I resented the life that my family had arranged for me.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 23.ogg Eide: Then one day, I met a beautiful woman amongst the people. Her roots were in Mondstadt... but that mattered not to me. It was love at first sight.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 24.ogg Eide: ...Caribert faced great hardship from the very moment of his birth, all due to my selfish desires... and I was never able to be there by his side for any of it.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 25.ogg Eide: ...After all that, he turned into a hilichurl right before my very eyes.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 26.ogg Eide: I always owed him much, and now... at least I can finally be close to him.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 27.ogg Eide: She was...
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 28.ogg Eide: ...*sigh* We were separated. I do not wish to dwell on it.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 29.ogg Eide: ...It could be worse. I suffer the pain of loss because I once had everything I could wish for.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 30.ogg Eide: And now... now that I have lost almost everything, the little that remains I see with new clarity.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 31.ogg Eide: If nothing else... At least I still have Caribert.
Media:vo szaq202 3 eide 32.ogg Eide: Ah, yes, that reminds me. I only returned here to check on Caribert, but I do have other things I wish to do... You may come with me, if you're so inclined.
Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 01.ogg Eide: Over here.
Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 02.ogg Eide: I'm sure you're wondering why I brought Caribert here, to Sumeru.
Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 03.ogg Eide: Well, it's because he needs a medicine that can only be made here...
Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 04.ogg Eide: One which will help him to recover his clarity of mind.
Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 05.ogg Eide: I do not hope to break the curse. I am well aware of my powerlessness against the punishment of the gods.
Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 06.ogg Eide: But it's said that this medicine is imbued with the power of Sumeru's God of Wisdom, and can awaken the mind from a state of deep stupor... It has been used in the past to treat cases of mania.
Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 07.ogg Eide: I believe that it might just work...
Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 08.ogg Eide: ...I read about it in a book from the Royal Library of Khaenri'ah. It was banned, since this medicine requires the power of The Seven to work.
Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 09.ogg Eide: In my youth, I—I disliked the life of nobility, and craved excitement. I was leafing through some forbidden texts and happened upon it.
Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 10.ogg Eide: ...What other choice do I have? What exactly would you have me do?
Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 11.ogg Eide: The gods have already punished us! What does one more sin matter now?
Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 12.ogg Eide: Never mind, as long as you understand... I—I'm sorry, I struggle to take control of my mood sometimes... Perhaps a consequence of having lived too long.
Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 13.ogg Eide: As it happens, I am in dire need of some help to make this medicine.
Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 14.ogg Eide: My hands don't have the dexterity they once did. I fear that they may be decaying from within... all thanks to this curse of immortality.
Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 15.ogg Eide: Okay, to start with, take this ingredient...

Media:vo szaq202 5 eide 16.ogg Eide: Also, do you have any of Sumeru's regional specialties on hand? I believe they're called... Kalpalata Lotuses and Sumeru Roses.
