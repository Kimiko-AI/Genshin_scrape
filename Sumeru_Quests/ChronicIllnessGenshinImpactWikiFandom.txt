Media:vo xmaq003 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Don't sweat it, we've helped others deal with similar situations before.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: Wait, you've met other Forest Rangers before? I was planning to properly show you both how to identify The Withering before you left Gandharva Ville.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: Anyway, since you two are experienced adventurers, come with me, I'm sure you'll both be able to help.

Media:vo xmaq003 8 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Hmm, it seems the rumors about you are true then. In that case... Alright, you two may accompany me.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: We typically only teach visitors how to identify The Withering as they're about to leave Gandharva Ville. We'll make an exception today and show you what it looks like up close.

Media:vo xmaq003 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hey, look! That gloomy area over there looks like a Withering Zone.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Even though Paimon's seen one before, it's still kinda scary...
Media:vo xmaq003 9 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: Alright Traveler, we're about to enter the Withering Zone. Since you already have experience dealing with these things, you should already know what to do.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: But please remember, don't push yourself. If at any point it becomes too much, return outside the zone and take a breather. It could become a matter of life and death.

Media:vo xmaq003 9 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Stop, don't move any further. Look there, in the distance.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh, where? Oh! Look, those plants have withered... That whole area is kinda gloomy. Even the air looks like it's filled with ash.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ooh, Paimon doesn't like the look of this.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: That is The Withering.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Alright, Traveler, we're going to have to enter that Withering Zone. Once inside, we'll need to look for what we call Tumors of The Withering. If we eliminate those, then the area will be saved.
 Gotcha, let's do this.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Thank you. But I must warn you, don't push yourself. This is your first time handling this sort of thing, after all.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: Even with elemental powers, once you step inside the Withering Zone, you may experience extreme discomfort. If at any point it becomes too much, return outside the zone and take a breather. It could become a matter of life and death.
 Gotcha, let's do this.
 Hmm, it's a light and refreshing fragrance.
 How's Collei's condition now?
 Huh? You mean Irminsul is sick?
 I can also control the elements.
 I might be able to help with this.
 I think I've heard it somewhere before.
 Is there no way to permanently get rid of The Withering?
 No unusual feelings this time.
 No, I haven't.
 Quest DescriptionYesterday did not quite end so well, so you and Paimon decide to go check on Collei.
 So is there any cure for Eleazar?
 So what exactly was it that I saw?
 Thank you.
 They'll lose all control over their body!?
 Wait, can we come along?
 What I saw weren't hallucinations, were they?
(Traveler): (Spreading and extending, a massive cavern... Sounds a lot like what I saw when I lost consciousness in the cave.)
A messenger Dusk Bird is perching on a stand nearby.
Media:vo dialog xmaq003 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Shhh! Collei's asleep! Let's come back once she's feeling better.
Media:vo dialog xmaq003 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Anyway, please take good care of Haypasia.
Media:vo dialog xmaq003 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: I'll go prepare Collei's medicine now. Using the Nilotpala Lotuses while they're still fresh will significantly boost their effectiveness.
Media:vo dialog xmaq003 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Rest assured, Collei will recover quickly as long as she has her medicine.
Media:vo xmaq003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: *sigh* Paimon was thinking all night about what happened with Collei, and still can't figure out what the problem might be.
Media:vo xmaq003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Maybe she's in a better mood now... Let's go check on her.
Media:vo xmaq003 10 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: First, we must locate any branches sustaining the Withering Zone.
Media:vo xmaq003 10 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Great work. Now that all the branches have been cleared, we'll need to take care of the tumor.
Media:vo xmaq003 10 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Now! Destroy the Tumor of the Withering!
Media:vo xmaq003 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We did it! Everything's returning to normal now!
Media:vo xmaq003 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Um, Tighnari? You make it sound like we did well, but why does Paimon have the feeling you're worried about something?
Media:vo xmaq003 11 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh? But why's that?
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Yes, thanks to you two, we were able to quickly restore this area back to normal...
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: It's that obvious, huh? Alright, it's like this...
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Recently, the rate at which the Withering Zone appears has been increasing. Even though we were able to quickly clear that Withering Zone, it won't be long before another one appears.
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: If that simply meant more work for me, then that wouldn't be an issue... But it's far more severe than that. The Withering is leaving lasting effects on the rainforest itself.
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: For instance, even though we cleared out the Withering Zone, many of the plants that were affected will not recover.
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: This presents a crisis for the ecosystem itself. Many plants in the rainforest are already in decline, directly impacting the wildlife that depends on those plants.
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: And most disturbingly... as the appearances of Withering Zones have started to increase, Collei's case of Eleazar has also become more serious.
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: I'm still not sure of the exact reason. However, I've received word from acquaintances at the Akademiya that similar cases are being reported for patients with other conditions.
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: No, none that we know of. The Withering has been recorded in Sumeru for millennia. It's said that it originates from the depths of the world.
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: By the way, have you heard of Irminsul before?
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: Irminsul is a tree located deep beneath the surface. Although it isn't like any tree we know in a biological sense, you can basically think of it as a large tree that grows downwards rather than upwards.
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 12.ogg Tighnari: I'm sure you've heard of Ley Lines, right? They're like the roots of Irminsul, spreading and extending from a massive cavern deep underground all the way up to the surface.
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 13.ogg Tighnari: Ley Lines continually absorb the memories of this world, which are then funneled into Irminsul, allowing it to collect knowledge and wisdom from ancient times to present day.
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 14.ogg Tighnari: The Dendro Archon is known as the God of Wisdom because her consciousness is directly connected to it. It is also said that the Dendro Archon's power is a manifestation of Irminsul.
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 15.ogg Tighnari: And as for The Withering, its emergence is related to a disease that's affecting it.
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 16.ogg Tighnari: That's right. My ancestors learned of this from Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's familiars a long time ago, but even those mysterious creatures did not know of a cure for Irminsul.
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 17.ogg Tighnari: I'm afraid we rangers will be battling the Withering Zones here for a long time until a cure is found.
Media:vo xmaq003 11 tighnari 18.ogg Tighnari: Alright, that's enough on this topic for the time being. Now that we've taken care of things here, it's time for us to head back to Gandharva Ville.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 amir 01.ogg Amir: Oh, Tighnari, you all made it back! How did it go?
Media:vo xmaq003 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? What's wrong, Tighnari?
Media:vo xmaq003 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, her! How could we forget! Uh, so did something happen?
Media:vo xmaq003 12 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So, what's it say? And what's with that weird expression on your face? Ugh, just let Paimon read it...
Media:vo xmaq003 12 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? Uh, all Paimon sees are three squiggly lines...
Media:vo xmaq003 12 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: What? You mean she's been sitting there for three days!? Hey wait, how did you know all that from just a few lines on the paper?
Media:vo xmaq003 12 paimon 06a.ogg Paimon: Wait, you want us to bring her the rations? But will (Traveler) be okay if her cave is still filled with that funny incense?
Media:vo xmaq003 12 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Huh? Really? You're not feeling even a little drowsy?
Media:vo xmaq003 12 paimon 08a.ogg Media:vo xmaq003 12 paimon 08b.ogg Paimon: But wait, how'd you know that (he/she)'d be okay this time, Tighnari?
Media:vo xmaq003 12 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Uh, that sounds nice and all, but will she really help us? Seriously, she completely ignored us the last time we tried talking to her!
Media:vo xmaq003 12 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Haypasia should still be in the cave. Let's go inside and see how she's doing!
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: The Withering Zone you reported has been taken care of. No need to worry.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Huh? Wait, is that...?
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Oh no! Haypasia!
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: This Dusk Bird is Haypasia's designated courier for urgent news. You do remember her, don't you? She's the scholar you and Paimon were following when you first arrived in Sumeru.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: Let me see what's written in the letter first. Uh...
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: *sigh* Yes, allow me to explain. After we brought you from Haypasia's cave to Gandharva Ville, Haypasia resumed her meditation.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: She must have just finished. It's been nearly three days since she's had anything to eat, and it appears she's forgotten to prepare some rations. This letter is her asking us for help, we need to go.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Well, obviously because this has happened before... Last time she drew five lines, and by the time we found her... Ahem, well, I'd prefer not to remember that.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: Needless to say, Haypasia's been through worse, but we should still get to her as quickly as possible.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: I've got some emergency rations set aside for times like these. Paimon, Traveler, could you two bring these to her?
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: Let's find out. Here, (Traveler), take a smell and see.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 12.ogg Tighnari: So, how do you feel?
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 13a.ogg Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 13b.ogg Tighnari: Back when we were clearing the Withering Zone, I observed that (he/she) could adeptly manipulate the Dendro element. I knew then that (he/she) would be fine.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 14.ogg Tighnari: (Traveler), and if I may ask, when I was telling you two about Irminsul's Ley Lines, was what I described similar at all to what you saw when you were unconscious?
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 15.ogg Tighnari: That's correct, those weren't hallucinations at all, though I don't intend to apologize for deceiving you...
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 16.ogg Tighnari: Because what you saw is of significant importance, not just for the nation of Sumeru, but the entire world of Teyvat.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 17.ogg Tighnari: My forefathers were shown much favor by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. We took an oath to protect this nation together with her. Now that that duty has fallen to me, it was a part of my responsibilities to ascertain whether you could be entrusted with the fate of Sumeru.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 18.ogg Tighnari: Now, after seeing you in action with my own eyes, you have earned my confidence, and I no longer feel the need to hide any secrets from you.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 19.ogg Tighnari: When you passed out, your consciousness had connected directly with Irminsul. What you witnessed were actually real memories contained within Irminsul itself.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 20.ogg Tighnari: I could try to tell you more, but it would be better if you went to ask Haypasia instead. Her focus on meditation and use of Spirit Borneol are aimed at establishing a connection with Irminsul, just as you did.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 21.ogg Tighnari: That was because when you ran into her, she was in a special phase of her training. During that time, she must avoid communicating with others.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 22.ogg Tighnari: Please, wait here for a moment.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 23.ogg Tighnari: Here, take these. It's a meal I packed for Haypasia, as well as some other ingredients. I'm sure it'll come in handy.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 24.ogg Tighnari: Also, here's a letter that I would like you to give to her. Just show it to her, and she'll answer any questions you may have.
Media:vo xmaq003 12 tighnari 25.ogg Tighnari: No, I should be the one thanking you. You've both been a great help these last few days.
Media:vo xmaq003 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? Tighnari, what're you doing here? Where's Collei?
Media:vo xmaq003 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: You mean she's sick? How could she be... Oh, wait a minute, could it be because of what Paimon did yesterday?
Media:vo xmaq003 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So, Tighnari, what's really wrong with Collei...?
Media:vo xmaq003 2 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Ah, it's you two. I was just about to go look for you.
Media:vo xmaq003 2 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: I came to check on Collei's condition. To put it simply, she's not well.
Media:vo xmaq003 2 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: No, no need to worry. Something as small as you could never harm her. This sickness is something that Collei has been dealing with for some time.
Media:vo xmaq003 2 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Collei has been more excited than usual since you two arrived — a little too much so, to be honest. She hasn't remembered to take care of herself.
Media:vo xmaq003 2 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: *sigh* I suppose it's understandable, though. She hasn't been around anyone she considered a friend for some time now. It must have been refreshing for her to have you two here.
Media:vo xmaq003 2 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: Ahem, let's take this conversation elsewhere. Collei just fell asleep after taking her medicine. She needs some peace and quiet.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So Tighnari, what exactly is wrong with Collei? You said this is something she's been dealing with for some time. Just how serious is it?
Media:vo xmaq003 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Eleazar?
Media:vo xmaq003 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: That sounds terrifying!
Media:vo xmaq003 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wait, hold on! So when Collei seemed to be acting a little clumsy earlier, it was because...
Media:vo xmaq003 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: What? The Fatui!?
Media:vo xmaq003 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Aw, Paimon had no idea Collei's been through so much suffering...
Media:vo xmaq003 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: She doesn't need to apologize. None of this is her fault at all!
Media:vo xmaq003 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Don't worry, Tighnari! We'll take good care of her!
Media:vo xmaq003 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Yeah! We'd like to do something to help Collei, too!
Media:vo xmaq003 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: No problemo!
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Alright, let's continue our conversation here, shall we?
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: To be honest, I hadn't realized that you're that Honorary Knight from Mondstadt until Collei told me just now. I've also heard all about your deeds in Liyue and Inazuma.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: So, just to clarify, what I'm about to tell you about Collei is not because of who you are or your past feats. Instead, I am going to tell you because...
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Well, because Collei asked me to.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: And honestly speaking, I was against Collei revealing her past to you.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: But, she insisted, saying you two treated her with sincerity and as a friend. So now she wishes to reciprocate the gesture.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: Right, ever since she was a child, she's been afflicted with a disease called Eleazar.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Yes, it's a disease unique to the lands of Sumeru. It is characterized by dark and hardened scales that form on the body.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: At first, the afflicted may only feel mild numbness on affected areas of the skin. However, as the disease progresses, one may begin feeling fatigued and even experience peripheral paresthesia.[1]
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: In its final stages, the disease strips a person of the ability to control their own body, and they effectively become completely immobile.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: Correct. That would be the effects of Eleazar, which is precisely why I do not want her carrying or holding anything, lest she ends up hurting herself.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 12.ogg Tighnari: With appropriate treatment, the disease can be effectively controlled before it progresses to a more serious stage. However, there is, unfortunately, still no true cure for Eleazar.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 13.ogg Tighnari: Nevertheless, Collei's mother still hoped that there was something out there. She handed Collei over to an organization known as the Fatui after one of their members lied and said they had a cure.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 14.ogg Tighnari: Ah, it appears you are already familiar with them. That'll save me some explanation.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 15.ogg Tighnari: Anyway, the person who eventually rescued Collei and brought her to me for care said that she had been given to a Harbinger known as "The Doctor."
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 16.ogg Tighnari: I have no idea how this "Doctor" managed to do it, but her case of Eleazar was completely stable for all the years that Collei was with them.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 17.ogg Tighnari: However, Collei's days with the Fatui were anything but pleasant.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 18.ogg Tighnari: Collei is a resilient individual and always tries to appear cheerful, but her experience with the Fatui has left deep scars. Even now, she can still feel deathly afraid of someone touching her.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 19.ogg Tighnari: Oh, by the way, Paimon, Collei wanted me to tell you that she's sorry for scaring you yesterday. She also wanted both of you to know that she's sorry for hiding her illness.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 20.ogg Tighnari: Well said. I hope you'll get a chance to tell her that in person the next time you see her.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 21.ogg Tighnari: Collei once thought that it would be impossible for her to have any real friendships... I trust that you two will never let my trainee experience such emotional pain again.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 22.ogg Tighnari: Well, it's not too serious at this point. She over-exerted herself the last couple of days, which is what led to her break down this time. As long as she has taken her medicine and gets plenty of rest, she should get better.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 23.ogg Tighnari: Though, I must admit that Collei's condition was much more stable when she first arrived here in Gandharva Ville.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 24.ogg Tighnari: She was interested in the work of the Forest Rangers the moment she saw us. I could see that she was serious about learning, so I felt compelled to ask her to join us.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 25.ogg Tighnari: Her stamina has gotten much worse recently. Though a moderate amount of physical exercise is always necessary, I'm afraid the long-distance patrols are a little too much for her now.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 26.ogg Tighnari: Alright, now that I've told you about Collei's past, I think I'll head into the rainforest to find some ingredients needed for her medicine. I'll see you two later.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 27.ogg Tighnari: Alright, but I must warn you two, the rainforest is a dangerous place, especially for someone who's still recovering, like the Traveler. You must follow closely and listen to every instruction.
Media:vo xmaq003 3 tighnari 28.ogg Tighnari: Let's go then. We'll be looking for a plant known as Nilotpala Lotus. It's often used to help those afflicted with Eleazar recover their energy.
Media:vo xmaq003 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey Tighnari, where exactly are we going to find this plant?
Media:vo xmaq003 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmm, given the name, it sounds like we should be looking for it in the water.
Media:vo xmaq003 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, huh... okay then.
Media:vo xmaq003 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Note to Paimon: never bring up the topic of flowers with Tighnari.
Media:vo xmaq003 4 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Nilotpala Lotuses can be found all over the rainforest, but it often grows right here around Gandharva Ville.
Media:vo xmaq003 4 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: You are correct, Nilotpala Lotus grows in the water. When fully matured, they look like giant blue flowers floating on the water's surface. Quite an attractive species, if you ask me.
Media:vo xmaq003 4 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: The large petals are actually the plant's leaves and sepals[2] which surround a very small flower.
Media:vo xmaq003 4 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: You should note that many of the plants found in Sumeru have names that are contrary to their species.
Media:vo xmaq003 4 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: Take the Kalpalata, for example. The plant is not a lotus at all, but rather a vine. And then there's the Sumeru Rose, which is not a rose, completely contrary to its name...
Media:vo xmaq003 5 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: There should be Nilotpala Lotuses growing somewhere in this area. Let's split up and begin searching.
Media:vo xmaq003 5 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: If you could manage to gather four of them, that would be sufficient.
Media:vo xmaq003 5 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: We'll rendezvous here once you've gathered the needed amount.
Media:vo xmaq003 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Alright, we've gathered enough Nilotpala Lotuses. Let's head back to meet Tighnari.
Media:vo xmaq003 7 amir 01.ogg Amir: Hey! Tighnari!
Media:vo xmaq003 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey Tighnari, we found the lotuses you requested.
Media:vo xmaq003 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, Tighnari, someone's calling your name. They're dressed like a forest ranger.
Media:vo xmaq003 7 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Let me take a look... Hmm, good, very good. These are all excellent quality.
Media:vo xmaq003 7 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: I'm quite glad you two came along, your exploration experience helped save me a lot of time here. It seems we even have enough time to stock up on some other things I need...
Media:vo xmaq003 7 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Ah, yes, that's Amir and the others. But didn't they just set off not too long ago? What are they doing back so early?
Media:vo xmaq003 7 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Let's go find out what's going on.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 amir 01.ogg Amir: Tighnari, thank goodness we found you here. We were just about to head back and find you at Gandharva Ville.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 amir 02.ogg Amir: It's up ahead, deep in the river valley. It's appeared in a spot that blocks nearly the entire narrow part of the valley area, so we decided to come find you as quickly as possible.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 amir 03.ogg Amir: Sorry, I couldn't get a clear enough view to tell.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 amir 04.ogg Amir: You two have only just arrived in Sumeru. You're still unfamiliar with many things in these lands.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 amir 05.ogg Amir: There's a unique type of anomaly that occurs in the Sumeru rainforest. It's called "The Withering."
Media:vo xmaq003 8 amir 06.ogg Amir: The affected areas not only cause nearby vegetation to wither, but it's also lethal to wildlife and even people. If you don't carry a Vision, then you should think twice before approaching such places.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 amir 07.ogg Amir: That's right. If any of the Forest Rangers without a Vision come across a Withering Zone, we first make a record of the location and then have a ranger with the proper abilities deal with it, like Tighnari here.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 amir 08.ogg Amir: Only someone with a Vision can venture within a Withering Zone and find a way to deal with it.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 amir 09.ogg Amir: But, you don't seem to carry a Vision...
Media:vo xmaq003 8 nasrin 01.ogg Nasrin: We just discovered a Withering Zone.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 nasrin 02.ogg Nasrin: No one in our patrol team had a Vision, and it appeared to still be spreading, so we didn't risk getting any closer.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wait, Tighnari! Why don't you let us help you?
Media:vo xmaq003 8 paimon 02a.ogg Media:vo xmaq003 8 paimon 02b.ogg Paimon: Don't worry, (he/she) may not have a Vision, but (he/she)'s a real pro at using the power of the elements.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Don't sweat it, we've helped others deal with similar situations before.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: What's going on?
Media:vo xmaq003 8 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: The Withering is back!? But the patrol route you were on should have been already cleared just a week ago. It reappeared so quickly...
Media:vo xmaq003 8 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Can you tell me the exact location?
Media:vo xmaq003 8 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: And the radius of the contamination?
Media:vo xmaq003 8 tighnari 05a.ogg Tighnari: Okay, I understand. You made the right decision. I'll go deal with it right away. In the meantime, please guide these two back to Gandharva Ville.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: Yes, Amir is absolutely right. I wasn't kidding when I said the rainforest is a dangerous place.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: As Amir said, only someone with a Vision — that is, the power to manipulate elements — will be able to resist The Withering's corrosive effects for a time.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: Hmm, it seems the rumors about you are true then. In that case... Alright, you two may accompany me.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: We typically only teach visitors how to identify The Withering as they're about to leave Gandharva Ville. We'll make an exception today and show you what it looks like up close.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: Wait, you've met other Forest Rangers before? I was planning to properly show you both how to identify The Withering before you left Gandharva Ville.
Media:vo xmaq003 8 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: Anyway, since you two are experienced adventurers, come with me, I'm sure you'll both be able to help.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh, where? Oh! Look, those plants have withered... That whole area is kinda gloomy. Even the air looks like it's filled with ash.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ooh, Paimon doesn't like the look of this.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hey, look! That gloomy area over there looks like a Withering Zone.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Even though Paimon's seen one before, it's still kinda scary...
Media:vo xmaq003 9 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Stop, don't move any further. Look there, in the distance.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: That is The Withering.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: Alright, Traveler, we're going to have to enter that Withering Zone. Once inside, we'll need to look for what we call Tumors of The Withering. If we eliminate those, then the area will be saved.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: Thank you. But I must warn you, don't push yourself. This is your first time handling this sort of thing, after all.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: Even with elemental powers, once you step inside the Withering Zone, you may experience extreme discomfort. If at any point it becomes too much, return outside the zone and take a breather. It could become a matter of life and death.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: Alright Traveler, we're about to enter the Withering Zone. Since you already have experience dealing with these things, you should already know what to do.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: But please remember, don't push yourself. If at any point it becomes too much, return outside the zone and take a breather. It could become a matter of life and death.
Media:vo xmaq003 9 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: You ready, then? Let's go!
Tighnari leaves for a few moments...
