 "A Moment of Dreams"?
 (At least she's grasped the standard tropes of adventurer stories.)
 (I want to interrupt, but...)
 (Is she remembering something about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata?)
 (No, she shouldn't be able to remember anymore.)
 ...Sounds kinda weird.
 And almost fell.
 Have you tried looking at her photos right before you fall asleep?
 Honestly, I don't have any good tips.
 I agree, it doesn't really feel like a cause for concern.
 I can understand your curiosity...
 I don't think I really have a choice.
 I think I understand.
 I think they need to build up some courage first.
 I'm happy to help if you ever need it.
 Indeed.
 Is she doing what I think she is...?
 Let's go get a breath of fresh air.
 Maybe this phenomenon is already spreading.
 Nahida.
 Oh, that's a tough one...
 Quest DescriptionOne day, you and Paimon notice that many people in Sumeru City are talking about dreams...
 Sounds like a good plan.
 Step DescriptionYou and Paimon meet Nahida at the venue of "A Moment of Dreams." Together, you hear many creative dream ideas shared by event participants. Among them, you are a little concerned about a man named Ilman, so you decide to escort him to the place he has been dreaming about.

 Still, not quite the same as approaching an archon.
 Sure, let's go have a look.
 There are some things that "expert" just doesn't seem to go with...
 They didn't really care about the answers.
 Vivid dreams are just really exciting to them.
 We usually journey through far more dangerous places than this.
 What's that?
 Yes, of course.
 Yes, please enlighten us, esteemed expert.
 You were just drawing from a similar example.
 You were sleepwalking...
 You're the boss...
(Traveler): (I'd better go with her. The whole Greater Lord Rukkhadevata thing will take some explaining...)
(Traveler): (Nahida should at least know that she once existed in this world.)
(Traveler): (Speaking of longing for the deceased, I'd better tell Nahida about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.)
After a long time, the "experts" finally conclude their work.
After some initial commotion, everyone finally forms a queue.
Media:Vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 01.ogg Pedrush (I hope a lot of people will come to participate today.)
Media:vo dialog nhdlq001 debbi 01.ogg Debbi: Yeah, I'm starting to wonder if it's some kind of hint.
Media:vo dialog nhdlq001 debbi 02.ogg Debbi: After talking so much about dreams, I'm feeling a little bit sleepy.
Media:vo dialog nhdlq001 debbi 03.ogg Debbi: It's just sleepwalking, they're really overreacting.
Media:vo dialog nhdlq001 debbi 04.ogg Debbi: *yawn* I'm getting really sleepy.
Media:vo dialog nhdlq001 ilman 01.ogg Ilman: Haydar...
Media:vo dialog nhdlq001 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: ...Another recurring dream?
Media:vo dialog nhdlq001 nasser 01.ogg Nasser: What a lucky day... Just wait till my friends hear about this!
Media:vo dialog nhdlq001 nasser 02.ogg Nasser: It's just a dream. How bad could it be?
Media:vo dialog nhdlq001 paulin 01.ogg Pawlin: I wish my dreams could be a little more practical, you know... Maybe something like becoming rich and famous overnight.
Media:vo dialog nhdlq001 paulin 02.ogg Pawlin: What's all the sudden commotion about?
Media:vo dialog nhdlq001 pedrush 01.ogg Pedrush: I didn't expect the Dendro Archon to attend this event in person... It's like a dream.
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh, that sounds like some kind of sweet drink!
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh right, everyone's able to dream again now!
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So it's kinda like a fireside chat...
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Yeah, but to us, dreaming is as normal as breathing.
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Wait, but if there are free drinks and snacks involved, then Paimon might consider it!
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Mm-hmm, but no need to get so excited, it's really nothing special.
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Oh, "expert." Hehe, Paimon kinda likes it!
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Wow, how accommodating!
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 09a.ogg Paimon: Sign us up! Ah, but wait... Paimon's getting ahead of herself again. We should see what the Traveler thinks first.
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Eh? Why aren't you saying anything?
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Hehe! Alright, hurry up and take us to be dream experts!
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Do you know what's the most important part of being an "expert"?
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Nope, it's all about the title. From now on, Paimon will be known as "Paimon, the Dream Expert"!
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 02.ogg Pedrush: Hello, Traveler. Have you ever heard of "A Moment of Dreams"?
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 03.ogg Pedrush: Haha, I'm afraid not. It's the name of an event we started to hold regularly.
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 04.ogg Pedrush: Dreams have become quite the hot topic in Sumeru, and many people are excited to share the dreams they've seen at night.
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 05.ogg Pedrush: The same goes for me! The last time I dreamed was when I was but a little child, so I can't help but feel excited and nostalgic about dreaming again.
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 06.ogg Pedrush: Yes! We organized an event to give everyone with new dreams a platform to freely share their experiences.
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 07.ogg Pedrush: And thus our event, "A Moment of Dreams," was born.
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 08.ogg Pedrush: You could say that. We hear all sorts of wild and fabulous stories every day. Really, why not have a listen for yourselves?
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 09.ogg Pedrush: Oh really? So you mean... you've already seen many dreams?
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 10.ogg Pedrush: No no no, we need experienced participants like you to share your experiences with dreaming.
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 11.ogg Pedrush: Please allow me to address you two as "dream experts"!
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 12.ogg Pedrush: Now you seem interested, hehe. Please, follow me to the meeting place. It won't take much of your time.
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 13.ogg Pedrush: Rest assured, you'll find all the drinks and snacks you'd like there.
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 14.ogg Pedrush: Haha, very good. Follow me, then.
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 15.ogg Pedrush: Ahem... Well, I suppose it must be accumulating knowledge and sharing your experiences?
Media:vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 16.ogg Pedrush: O—Okay...
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 01.ogg Ata: My question is simple. My everyday life is very difficult, so I would like to become a Slime in my dreams. How can I do that?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 02.ogg Ata: Wait, why did all of your dreams end so tragically?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 03.ogg Ata: I suppose you're right... They are monsters, after all.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 04.ogg Ata: I just want to experience a different life, but it seems that becoming a monster would be even worse than my current life.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 05.ogg Ata: Hmm, maybe I'd be happier if I became just a regular Finch or fish...
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 06.ogg Ata: A—Alright... I'll give it a try.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 07.ogg Ata: Hey, drop the nicknames, would ya? Besides... I don't want to become a Slime anymore. Maybe a Finch or fish is more suitable for me.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 08.ogg Ata: I guess I just want to experience something different. My everyday life is nothing but the same...
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 09.ogg Ata: The sky is right above me, and the ocean just over the horizon, yet I remain caged in a life of monotony.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 10.ogg Ata: Because if I don't work, I won't have any Mora. Sure, I don't want to be out hammering nails and cutting wood every day, but I have aging parents and young children to take care of.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 11.ogg Ata: By the time this all dawned on me, I realized that my life has already been filled to the brim by trifling matters, and I have no more freedom.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 12.ogg Ata: Really? That sounds pretty terrible! Then what should I do?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 13.ogg Ata: Huh? Replacing my hammer?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 14.ogg Ata: Well, of course. A good hammer needs to be heavy enough to drive the nail in with just a couple taps... and the handle has to have a good grip to it — not too smooth.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 15.ogg Ata: Come to think of it, I haven't replaced my current hammer in quite some time.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 16.ogg Ata: That makes sense... I think it'd give me a good boost of energy at work!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 17.ogg Ata: Yes, yes... I get it now. This is a real eye-opener for me!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ata 18.ogg Ata: I'll go and pick out a new hammer right away... No, I should make one of my own. Thank you, great Dendro Archon!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 debbi 01.ogg Debbi: I want to bring the souvenir box in my room into my dream!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 01.ogg Ilman: They must be dream experts from another land... Great!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 02.ogg Ilman: Oh, it's my turn. Esteemed expert, I want to know what posture I should sleep in so I can have the same dream as the one I had last night.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 03.ogg Ilman: Oh, it's quite ordinary. I sat and chatted with my wife on a sunny day, listening to the breeze blowing through the valley.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 04.ogg Ilman: Well, uh... Unfortunately, she passed away.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 05.ogg Ilman: No, it's fine, I didn't make that clear. I just want a chance to see her again.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 06.ogg Ilman: Oh, is that all I have to do?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 07.ogg Ilman: You do have a point... I'll give it a try tonight! Thanks for your wise advice!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 08.ogg Ilman: ...
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 09.ogg Ilman: I already asked the experts my question earlier, but I wanted to hear the Dendro Archon's response, too.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 10.ogg Ilman: What should I do if I want to see my deceased wife in my dreams every night?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 11.ogg Ilman: No, I suppose not... But our time together in my dreams is not just reliving our past together.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 12.ogg Ilman: I don't know. Maybe it's because I miss her too much, but it's really as if she had come back to life in my dreams.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 13.ogg Ilman: She even remembers each and every dream. After I wake up and then continue dreaming again later, we can pick up our conversation right where we last left off.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 14.ogg Ilman: It's almost as if my wife has obtained a second life in my dreams. But the more vivid she appears, the emptier I feel and the more painful it is when I wake up. I don't know whether to call it a blessing or a curse...
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 15.ogg Ilman: I don't know... I suppose my biggest regret is that I couldn't spend the rest of my life with her.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 16.ogg Ilman: I really felt like I was ready to move on. I wouldn't be so hesitant now if it weren't for these hyper-realistic dreams I've been having.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 17.ogg Ilman: Yes, I know... That's why I'm also a little disappointed in myself. I still need to take care of our child.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 18.ogg Ilman: And it's probably not good to let her see me in such a state...
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 19.ogg Ilman: *sigh* Anyway, thanks for your advice, great Dendro Archon.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 kathya 01.ogg Kathya: Oh, my turn, my turn! Ahem, I want to know the name of the plant in my dream!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: My question is, why didn't you immediately tell me about such an interesting place?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: Interesting events like "A Moment of Dreams" don't happen every day, after all. No matter how busy things are, I'd still set aside some time to check it out.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 03.ogg Nahida: Anyway, I really didn't expect to meet you here.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: You're not wrong. All right, they can ask me anything. The more interesting, the better.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 05.ogg Nahida: Huh? What's wrong? You were all so excited a minute ago... why the sudden hesitation?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 06.ogg Nahida: Even so, it's not like I look super intimidating or anything, right?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 07.ogg Nahida: And in terms of reputation and renown, you've also done many great things in Sumeru, yet they didn't even flinch at you.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 08.ogg Nahida: Alas, the interesting questions have all vanished in an instant. It appears I'm the one spoiling the fun here. I'll see myself out.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 09.ogg Nahida: I don't want to get in the way of the original purpose of "A Moment of Dreams," which is to let people gather here and freely share their marvelous dreams.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 10.ogg Nahida: Now the atmosphere here is like water poured into a container... The water is more secure and settled, but it has lost its free-flowing nature from the river.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 11.ogg Nahida: I just wanted to be another drop in the water, not the cold and restrictive container.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 12.ogg Nahida: I see. So you want to become a small animal in your dreams, right? Why do you think that sounds good to you?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 13.ogg Nahida: So you want to experience something new in your dreams... Sorry, I'm getting a little confused. Why don't you seek out some new experiences in real life?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 14.ogg Nahida: But if that's the case, then even if you became a flying bird or swimming fish, you will still be hammering nails and cutting wood in your dreams.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 15.ogg Nahida: The reason is you've already been caged. It doesn't matter what your physical body turns into, your mind will still be stuck in the same predicament.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 16.ogg Nahida: I don't know everything that you're going through, but how about replacing your hammer?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 17.ogg Nahida: That's right. Having worked for such a long time, you of all people must know what makes a good hammer.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 18.ogg Nahida: You should replace it. Then decorate the handle with something you like... maybe some ornaments, fur, or a hard leather wrapping. Then, write the names of your children on it.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 19.ogg Nahida: A new sense of adventure often begins with the little things in life.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 20.ogg Nahida: You don't need to become a bird in the air or fish in the sea. You only need to do your best in life, and all those things you cherish will become your source of happiness.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 21.ogg Nahida: Actually, I didn't really understand the problem.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 22.ogg Nahida: I gave him that advice because I once saw a worker doing the same thing. Whenever he became tired, he would look at some names on the handle of his tool.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 23.ogg Nahida: After a moment, he'd start to smile. It really surprised me at the time... My guess is that the names on the handle were of important people to him.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 24.ogg Nahida: Mm-hmm. After observation, I know this kind of behavior motivates people... but why is that?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 25.ogg Nahida: Is it because of excitement, anticipation, or helplessness? I really don't know... And even if I could know what's going through his mind, it's still difficult to fully grasp his feelings.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 26.ogg Nahida: Hehe, that's why I was a bit nervous just now. But luckily, seeing his happy face in the end reassured me that I didn't say anything wrong.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 27.ogg Nahida: Don't mind me, though. This is just my way of learning.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 28.ogg Nahida: Thanks, you two. That makes me feel a lot better. Let's move on to the next question, shall we?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 29.ogg Nahida: Hmm, longing for the deceased...
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 30.ogg Nahida: Even if you keep reliving those beautiful memories, it'll only highlight the emptiness in your real life.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 31.ogg Nahida: If your wife were still alive, she certainly wouldn't want to see you like this, would she?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 32.ogg Nahida: That's really amazing. Statistically speaking, continuous dreams are extremely rare.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 33.ogg Nahida: Maybe all of this is rooted in your deep longing for her.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 34.ogg Nahida: Were there any unresolved matters or regrets between the two of you?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 35.ogg Nahida: But dreams are, and will forever be, just dreams. We are people living in the real world.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 36.ogg Nahida: It's not good to be overly obsessed with dreams. All it'll do is fill up your mind and eat away at your thoughts.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 37.ogg Nahida: Hmm, I'm a little worried about him. I hope he can find a way to cheer up soon.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 38.ogg Nahida: I think I can handle things from here. You don't need to stay here if you find it boring. You're here to have a good time, after all.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 nasser 01.ogg Nasser: Oh, I have a question! Me first! Me first!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa, Paimon didn't expect them to be so enthusiastic...
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon knows! Paimon's had this kind of dream before, so she knows a thing or two.
(Paimon gains the title "Expert")
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: The first time, Paimon became an Anemo Slime. Paimon was shot by an adventurer's arrow and flew in the sky all night long.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: The second time, Paimon became a Dendro Slime. A group of kids thought Paimon was a Radish and pulled out all the grass on her head. It was super painful!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: The third time, Paimon became a Cryo Slime. In the end, Paimon was captured by a chef and turned into a smoothie.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: And the fourth time, Paimon became a powerful Geo Slime and went to take revenge on the Forest Boar that used to bully Paimon.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: But then the boar showed up with all its relatives, and Paimon lost again.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Because Slimes are monsters, even though they look cute, they usually cause trouble and end up getting killed by adventurers.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Things don't tend to end well for monsters. Believe Paimon.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: It looks like being an expert is way easier than Paimon imagined.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Next!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Uh, well...
(Paimon's title becomes "Expert?")
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Hey! You're supposed to be helping!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Um, first, why don't you tell Paimon about the dream you want to have again?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Why don't you just find your wife and talk with her? There's no need to wait for a dream!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Oh!? Uh, sorry! Paimon shouldn't have assumed anything.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Yeah, it's not really about posture. What you think about right before falling asleep is probably way more important.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Think about it, if you're the one thinking about her, and you're the one that'll be dreaming about her, then it'll be easier to connect your thoughts and dreams.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: Hey, no rush. One at a time!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: Ugh, their questions were way too difficult. We don't actually know anything more than they do. We're just more experienced dreamers, that's all.
(Paimon no longer has a title)
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 21.ogg Paimon: You do have a point. It's more rewarding to explore and contemplate the meaning of a question than to focus on the answer itself.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 22.ogg Paimon: Right now, these people are like wanderers who've starved for three days and three nights and are desperate to replenish their energy. Any explanation they get now is like pure sustenance to them, no matter how good the explanation really is!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 23.ogg Paimon: Oh, and now that Paimon has said that, you know who comes to mind?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 24.ogg Paimon: Bingo! If she was here, she'd probably be making some similar analogy.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 25.ogg Paimon: Unfortunately, she's super busy right now, and may not have time for gatherings like this.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 26.ogg Paimon: Eh? But you saw how we answered all the questions just now... We're not really all that knowledgeable.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 27.ogg Paimon: Huh, Nahida!? How did you get here!?
(Pedrush bows towards Nahida and walks off)
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 28.ogg Paimon: Oh, right! If there's anyone that understands dreams, it's you! You should be able to help us answer all these questions!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 29.ogg Paimon: Aw, that's not true, Nahida!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 30.ogg Paimon: She's sulking...
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 31.ogg Paimon: Um, hey, it's all right, everyone. No need to be shy! The Dendro Archon is really nice, so please, just go ahead and ask! Otherwise, she'll leave.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 32.ogg Paimon: Oh, it's the slime guy.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 33.ogg Paimon: That's our Nahida! Only you would know how to get right to the heart of the problem.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 34.ogg Paimon: Huh?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 35.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets what you mean... Huh, Paimon had no idea it takes you so much effort to understand these kinds of things...
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 36.ogg Paimon: Hey, don't forget about Paimon! Everyone knows that Paimon's also super skilled at reading people's feelings!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 37.ogg Paimon: Huh. You know, they say that whatever's on your mind is what goes into your dreams.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 paulin 01.ogg Pawlin: I dreamt of a raven flying over the wasteland last night. Does that have any kind of special meaning?
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 pedrush 01.ogg Pedrush: Sorry to interrupt, everyone. We finally have some REAL dream experts joining us!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 pedrush 02a.ogg Pedrush: Esteemed experts, this way, please. Ahem, now, if anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask them.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 pedrush 03.ogg Pedrush: No rush. Everyone, please line up and ask in an orderly fashion!
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 pedrush 04.ogg Pedrush: Dear experts, we have another guest who would like to consult you.
Media:vo nhdlq001 2 pedrush 05.ogg Pedrush: Ah, but this guest is rather... special.
(Nahida walks up)
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 debbi 01.ogg Debbi: (If it IS a hint, well... I haven't seen them for a long time.)
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 debbi 02.ogg Debbi: (Maybe I should find a place to sleep, or go to the cafe...)
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 01.ogg Ilman: (The Dendro Archon made a really good point...)
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 02.ogg Ilman: Yes. I think the Dendro Archon made a really good point. I need to stop dwelling on my wife like this and move on with my life.
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 03.ogg Ilman: Now that I think about it, my wife and I always meet at a familiar place in my dreams.
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 04.ogg Ilman: I know where that place exists in reality, but it's a bit far and dangerous. I don't dare to go there on my own.
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 05.ogg Ilman: But, at the same time, I feel as if I should go and have a look anyway. Perhaps I'll be able to move on once I see that there's nothing there.
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 06.ogg Ilman: Otherwise, I'll keep on feeling like everything is covered in a haze... like I'm only half-awake.
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 07.ogg Ilman: Once I can stop dreaming about that place, I'll probably be able to get my life back together.
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 08.ogg Ilman: Actually, you two are adventurers, right? If it's okay with you, could you escort me to that place?
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 09.ogg Ilman: Yeah, I hope so too.
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 10.ogg Ilman: Oh, there's no need to trouble you, great Dendro Archon. I imagine you must have many other important things to deal with.
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 11.ogg Ilman: Hmm, I didn't know the great Dendro Archon could become puzzled, too...
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: Ahem! Are you headed off to some interesting place without telling me again?
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: I just finished. And I really got a lot out of it... so many interesting and novel thoughts.
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 nahida 03.ogg Nahida: Anyway, it looks like you're going somewhere. Why don't you take me with you?
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: No need to stand on ceremony. Besides, I wouldn't have asked to come along if I didn't have a good reason.
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 nahida 05.ogg Nahida: I wanted to use this opportunity to discuss with you some things that are puzzling me right now.
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 nahida 06.ogg Nahida: I'm not all that different from you, you know. All right, let's go. We can talk on the way.
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 nasser 01.ogg Nasser: (Wow, it's really the Dendro Archon.)
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Are you feeling any better now?
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yeah, it might also be a good chance for us to unwind.
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Even if you can't see your wife there, taking in some nice scenery will definitely help cheer you up.
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Alright, go ahead and get yourself ready then.
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh, wait, aren't you supposed to be answering questions?
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 paulin 01.ogg Pawlin: ...(Or maybe a more exciting love life... Nah, who am I kidding...)
Media:vo nhdlq001 3 pedrush 01.ogg Pedrush: (Should I continue expanding the scale of this event...?)
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 01.ogg Ilman: Do adventurers often go to places like this?
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 02.ogg Ilman: Hmm, I guess so.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 03.ogg Ilman: Yes, for the most part. Our place is on the summit just up ahead.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 04.ogg Ilman: When I saw her in my dreams, we didn't do anything but talk about ordinary, mundane topics.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 05.ogg Ilman: I'd tell her about our daughter, Haydar, and she always listened intently.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 06.ogg Ilman: She would also reminisce about the past with me, telling me interesting stories and cracking jokes.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 07.ogg Ilman: It feels like no matter how long we may chat, it's never enough.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 08.ogg Ilman: That's right. She always listened to me carefully in real life, and now, she's doing the same in my dreams.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 09.ogg Ilman: She always surprises me with some details from our lives in the real world. The fact that she can remember such things makes me feel like she's alive.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 10.ogg Ilman: I don't understand it either, but I have no reason to suspect or reject these dreams. They're too beautiful.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 11.ogg Ilman: Oh, so you were waiting for me here? Well, guess what, I've brought someone amazing with me today.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 12.ogg Ilman: When the Dendro Archon said she wanted to come with me, I could hardly believe it!
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 13.ogg Ilman: I'll bring Haydar once I'm more familiar with the way here. She's been telling me that she really misses you.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 14.ogg Ilman: Wait, Maynar. Don't go that way, it's dangerous.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 15.ogg Ilman: Uh... Huh?
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 16.ogg Ilman: Maynar... Where's Maynar?
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 17.ogg Ilman: What happened...
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 18.ogg Ilman: Huh? Sleepwalking?
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 19.ogg Ilman: Oh, right... It was all just a dream...
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 20.ogg Ilman: The moment I reached the summit, I saw my wife, Maynar, sitting there, and walked over to her.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 21.ogg Ilman: After I introduced her to you, she seemed a little flustered and started walking away. I told her to stop because of the cliff...
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 22.ogg Ilman: And then she seemed to suddenly disappear. A strong wind started to blow around me and the sky grew dark.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 23.ogg Ilman: When I realized something wasn't right, I woke up.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 24.ogg Ilman: I don't think so... I slept a lot yesterday, and I don't feel very sleepy now.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 25.ogg Ilman: I think I know what happened now, I'm sorry... If it weren't for you, I would have fallen.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 26.ogg Ilman: ...O—Okay.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: So this is where you always meet your wife in your dreams?
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: This is the part I'm a little puzzled about...
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 03.ogg Nahida: I am very familiar with dreams, and normally, they lack logic and continuity.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: But you said she could remember what you had told her before, right?
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 05.ogg Nahida: However, the problem is that his dreams have too much structure and continuity. Most dreams are far more fragile than you could imagine.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 06.ogg Nahida: For example, a loud noise outside your window in the real world could cause your dream self to get loaded into and fired out of a big cannon.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 07.ogg Nahida: Another example... If you're thirsty in the real world, then you might find yourself trudging through a desert in your dream.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 08.ogg Nahida: But the appearance of your wife seems unusually stable and unaffected by any outside interference. Statistically, this should be extremely rare.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 09.ogg Nahida: But I still want to figure out the how and the why. These kinds of dreams are novel to me as well. That's why I want to have a look at the scene your dreams have been taking place at.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 10.ogg Nahida: Let's go! Just think of it as a nice little hike to the top of the mountain.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 11.ogg Nahida: No matter. We'll just finish them quickly.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 12.ogg Nahida: Of course. This is all part of our little trip.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 13.ogg Nahida: I've yet to see anything strange about this place.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 14.ogg Nahida: I do not plan to deny the power of longing. Such an intense but unquantifiable emotion could indeed have the power to organize dreams.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 15.ogg Nahida: Uh-oh, he's gonna fall. Catch him!
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 16.ogg Nahida: He's in a dream now. What he said just now matches almost perfectly with the dreams he described to us earlier.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 17.ogg Nahida: I find it a little strange as well, but we mustn't awaken someone while they're sleepwalking. All we can do is sit here and wait.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 18.ogg Nahida: Maybe we've affected the way his subconscious constructs dreams by following him here.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 19.ogg Nahida: Anyway, all that matters is that you woke up safe and sound.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 20.ogg Nahida: Let's head back now. Don't come back to this place again for the time being.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 21.ogg Nahida: We still don't have enough evidence to work off of, so it's hard to draw any reliable conclusions yet... But I'm concerned that Ilman's case may not be unique to him...
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 22.ogg Nahida: Right, and not only at "A Moment of Dreams." There may be people like this all across Sumeru.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 23.ogg Nahida: We need to understand what's happening and the rate of its development as soon as possible.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ah, it's always nice to go for a leisurely stroll!
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Sometimes, it's the little things in life that matter the most.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Whoa, that's pretty weird... Well, dreams are kinda weird to begin with.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Well, he really wasn't kidding. This place definitely isn't safe.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh? Are you going to fight too, Nahida?
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: The scenery here is amazing... It also seems like a great spot for eating snacks and taking a nap.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Paimon wouldn't mind spending some time here every day, either. *sigh*
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: His wife must be a really amazing person.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Huh? Wait, where'd he go?
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Huh? Wh—What's wrong with him?
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: There's nobody there.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Phew, luckily he didn't fall... But what was all that rambling about? He also looks like he's passed out...
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Oh? So... he fell asleep, and started to have the same dream?
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Oh, good! You're finally awake.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: That sounds pretty wild... Maybe you were just too tired.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Nahida, what's on your mind? Paimon's a little worried now.
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Oh right, come to think of it, there were lots of people from the event who had vivid memories of their dreams!
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Then there's no time to lose. Let's head back!
Media:vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: Stop standing there, Ilman! Let's go!
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 debbi 01.ogg Debbi: Oh, I think she already left. She said there was somewhere she wanted to go...
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 debbi 02.ogg Debbi: Yes, she did briefly mention it... somewhere near Chatrakam Cave.
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 debbi 03.ogg Debbi: Sure thing. *sigh* Who would have known things would've turned out like this...
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: We have an emergency on our hands. Please notify everyone here that while they can continue to discuss their dreams, they mustn't try to visit or recreate the locations and scenes that they have been experiencing in them.
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: Thank you, that would be very helpful.
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 nahida 03.ogg Nahida: Can you tell us where she went?
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: Alright, thank you. We'll go look for her.
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 nahida 05.ogg Nahida: Please help us tell the others not to do anything reckless.
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh no, did she want to look for the place from her dreams, too?
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 pedrush 01.ogg Pedrush: Oh, you're back already. How did it go?
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 pedrush 02.ogg Pedrush: What? A—Alright, if that's the wish of the great Dendro Archon...
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 pedrush 03.ogg Pedrush: But could you at least tell me what happened? You all look so serious...
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 pedrush 04.ogg Pedrush: I see, I never knew even a dream could be so dangerous.
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 pedrush 05.ogg Pedrush: Don't worry. I'll be sure to notify all the event participants, and inform the other staff members about what has happened.
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 pedrush 06.ogg Pedrush: Using the event registration list, I should be able to contact more people that were interested in dreams, and warn them about the situation.
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 pedrush 07.ogg Pedrush: Let me confirm if all of today's participants are still here...
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 pedrush 08.ogg Pedrush: Ata has already left... It seemed that he was on his way to make a hammer, so that shouldn't be a problem. Oh? Wait a second... Where's Kathya?
Media:vo nhdlq001 5 pedrush 09.ogg Pedrush: Has anyone seen Kathya? Has she already left?
Media:vo nhdlq001 6 debbi 01.ogg Debbi: (Why am I so sleepy...?)
Media:vo nhdlq001 6 ilman 01.ogg Ilman: (Haydar...)
Media:vo nhdlq001 6 nasser 01.ogg Nasser: (So some people are having pretty realistic dreams, big deal. What are they so worried about?)
Media:vo nhdlq001 6 paulin 01.ogg Pawlin: (What happened? I need to ask someone and find out.)
You rush to stop Ilman, who is walking towards the edge of the cliff.
You tell Pedrush what happened on your trip with Ilman.
