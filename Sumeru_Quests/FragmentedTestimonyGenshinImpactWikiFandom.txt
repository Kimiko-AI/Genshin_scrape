 Do you know Siraj?
 Quest DescriptionYou've heard that Alhaitham has become the Acting Grand Sage. Considering his personality, will the other scholars accept him? Time to pay the Akademiya a visit.
 Step DescriptionIlyas claims that Siraj, a Vahumana researcher, is working on a dangerous experiment. According to Ilyas, Siraj will be meeting someone at the tavern. This matter seems to have caught Alhaitham's interest...
 Step DescriptionWhile looking for information on Alhaitham, you encounter a dazed man who seems to have something important to tell the matra...
 Step DescriptionYou find the Kshahrewar scholar who's been working with Siraj in the tavern, but Siraj himself is still nowhere to be found. Alhaitham decides to help Ilyas recover his memory...
 What do you mean?
Media:vo ahlq001 1 ilyas 01.ogg ???: The matra...
Media:vo ahlq001 1 ilyas 02.ogg Ilyas: I'm Ilyas. I have to talk to a matra about something important...
Media:vo ahlq001 1 ilyas 03.ogg Ilyas: No. I have to tell them myself. They are the only ones I can trust...
Media:vo ahlq001 1 ilyas 04.ogg Ilyas: Sorry, can you lend me your arm...? This is an important matter. Failure is not an option.
Media:vo ahlq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Y'know, Paimon's heard that Alhaitham's been made Acting Grand Sage, but with that personality of his... hoo boy. Uh, you think things will be okay?
Media:vo ahlq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Why don't we go to the Akademiya and ask around?
Media:vo ahlq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wow, news of Alhaitham being the Acting Grand Sage sure spread fast. Some people don't know who he is, though. Guess he's less famous than Paimon thought.
Media:vo ahlq001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Some people are saying good things, and others bad... especially that old guy just now. He really doesn't like Alhaitham...
Media:vo ahlq001 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hey, are you okay? Uh, you don't look too good...
Media:vo ahlq001 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: The matra?
Media:vo ahlq001 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: In the state you're in? You shouldn't push yourself.
Media:vo ahlq001 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Why don't you tell us what happened, and we'll pass on your message to a matra.
Media:vo ahlq001 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Since you put it that way, fine, we'll take you to a matra!
Media:vo ahlq001 1 pia 01.ogg Piah: I should be able to publish it next month. *sigh* A few days ago, I was worried that I'd have to stop my work on it. Thankfully, that didn't come to pass.
Media:vo ahlq001 1 pia 02.ogg Piah: The newly-appointed Acting Grand Sage reviewed all of our projects and gave us permission to continue our research.
Media:vo ahlq001 1 pia 03.ogg Piah: Yeah, I heard that selecting new sages has been taking some time, so he's just filling in.
Media:vo ahlq001 1 pia 04.ogg Piah: But it's all thanks to him that our research results weren't jeopardized...
Media:vo ahlq001 1 pia 05.ogg Piah: Once my paper is published, I'm definitely giving myself a long vacation and getting some much-needed rest. Mondstadt sounds like a good idea...
Media:vo ahlq001 1 pia 06.ogg Piah: (*sigh*)
Media:vo ahlq001 1 rajkumar 01.ogg Rajkumar: They're really out of their minds, making Alhaitham the Acting Grand Sage...
Media:vo ahlq001 1 rajkumar 02.ogg Rajkumar: Fool! Do you think I'm angry because I wasn't chosen for the position? No, it's because I don't understand why they chose HIM.
Media:vo ahlq001 1 rajkumar 03.ogg Rajkumar: He was one of my students, but he rarely attended class. When I asked him about it, he retorted that self-study was a better use of his time...
Media:vo ahlq001 1 rajkumar 04.ogg Rajkumar: What brazen arrogance! Misery of miseries... for the Akademiya to have him as the Acting Grand Sage!? *cough* *cough*
Media:vo ahlq001 1 rancho 01.ogg Rancho: How's everything going with your thesis?
Media:vo ahlq001 1 rancho 02.ogg Rancho: Well, Azar was one of your thesis advisers — honestly, I was afraid that you might have gotten dragged down as well. How did things get settled?
Media:vo ahlq001 1 rancho 03.ogg Rancho: Acting Grand Sage? That sounds like a new thing.
Media:vo ahlq001 1 rancho 04.ogg Rancho: (I wonder if things are going smoothly with her thesis...)
Media:vo ahlq001 1 rehan 01.ogg Rehan: Take it easy, Professor. I'm puzzled as well. Just going by qualifications, you're one of our most preeminent scholars. I don't know why they picked a stripling like him...
Media:vo ahlq001 1 rehan 02.ogg Rehan: Professor, don't get so worked up. I'll go get you some water!
Media:vo ahlq001 1 rezakhani 01.ogg Rezakhani: Psst... Wanna hear a secret? I've heard the new Acting Grand Sage is from Haravatat!
Media:vo ahlq001 1 rowshan 01.ogg Rowshan: Someone named Alhaitham. Never met him myself, but he's a real hot topic right now — lots of things being said about him. Hard to tell what's true and what isn't, though.
Media:vo ahlq001 1 rowshan 02.ogg Rowshan: There's also a Vahumana scholar who's been in the spotlight recently. They say that he's a likely pick to be one of the next sages.
Media:vo ahlq001 1 sahba 01.ogg Fariba: Really? Who is it?
Media:vo ahlq001 1 sahba 02.ogg Fariba: Oh, is he teaching any courses? Maybe we should drop by...
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 01.ogg Aarav: You two look familiar. Are you friends of Mahamatra Cyno? Um, I'm afraid he's out on a mission right now.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 02.ogg Aarav: But if you'd like, I can pass whatever message you might have on to him.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 03.ogg Aarav: Oh? If you don't mind, why don't you tell me about it first?
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 04.ogg Aarav: Siraj? That name sounds familiar. Isn't he a Vahumana researcher?
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 05.ogg Aarav: Yes, one of their most renowned, in fact. I hear he's as daring as he is intelligent.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 06.ogg Aarav: There are rumors he'll become Vahumana's next sage... Uh, but please continue, good sir. What about Siraj?
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 07.ogg Aarav: There's no rush. Please, take your time.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 08.ogg Aarav: What kind of experiments was he conducting? Where is this cave?
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 09.ogg Aarav: Even if what you say is... *sigh* All right, I'll have some of my colleagues look into Siraj.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 10.ogg Aarav: But before that, I would like to administer the matra lie detector test.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 11.ogg Aarav: Please don't take it the wrong way. This is just standard protocol.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 12.ogg Aarav: Sorry, but can you two wait out here a little while? We'll be back soon.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 13.ogg Aarav: Let me bring you up to speed. First things first, Ilyas passed the lie detector test.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 14.ogg Aarav: This indicates that what he said is highly credible. As such, we've decided to launch an investigation based on the leads he provided.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 15.ogg Aarav: Per protocol, this matter was reported to Acting Grand Sage Alhaitham. After hearing about it, he left a message for Mahamatra Cyno and then asked to join the investigation.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 16.ogg Aarav: It's already against protocol for Acting Grand Sage Alhaitham to participate in this investigation. As for you two...
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 17.ogg Aarav: Oh, never mind. After all, you were the ones who brought Ilyas here. I'll allow you to accompany us, but you have to promise to keep everything confidential.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 18.ogg Aarav: All right. In that case, I'll fill you in on what we know so far.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 19.ogg Aarav: Ilyas claimed that Siraj will be conducting some business with a Kshahrewar researcher at the tavern. This is one of his few clear memories. It seems he stumbled upon this information while escaping.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 20.ogg Aarav: Incidentally, Siraj isn't at the Akademiya right now. He applied for long-term off-site research one month ago.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 aarav 21.ogg Aarav: It's close to the time that Ilyas had given, so we've decided to head to the tavern and investigate any suspicious persons.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: You're overthinking things. My interest was piqued, is all.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: That's right. Aarav, prepare to head out. You two, do as you will.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 ilyas 01.ogg Ilyas: ...
Media:vo ahlq001 2 ilyas 02.ogg Ilyas: Siraj...
Media:vo ahlq001 2 ilyas 03.ogg Ilyas: I want to report him... for conducting a dangerous experiment.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 ilyas 04.ogg Ilyas: He kidnapped me, tied me up, and took me to that horrible cave... Experimental equipment everywhere...
Media:vo ahlq001 2 ilyas 05.ogg Ilyas: I ran as fast as I could... A little slower, and he would've caught me...
Media:vo ahlq001 2 ilyas 06.ogg Ilyas: I don't remember...
Media:vo ahlq001 2 ilyas 07.ogg Ilyas: All I remember is Siraj walking towards me, and then my head started feeling... weird.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 ilyas 08.ogg Ilyas: It's like a nightmare that I can't recall... I just know that that place is dangerous and that they must be stopped!
Media:vo ahlq001 2 ilyas 09.ogg Ilyas: Oh, I heard they conduct business in the tavern. We have to hurry...
Media:vo ahlq001 2 ilyas 10.ogg Ilyas: You think I'm lying?
Media:vo ahlq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We promised to take him to a matra, but we don't know that many, do we...?
Media:vo ahlq001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh wait, Cyno should be back at the Akademiya! Let's go find him!
Media:vo ahlq001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Uh, hey there! Excuse us, but is Cyno at the Akademiya?
Media:vo ahlq001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: We ran into this guy by the gates, and he seems really eager to speak with a matra. It sounds like something urgent.
Media:vo ahlq001 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Vahumana researcher?
Media:vo ahlq001 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Huh? You can't remember?
Media:vo ahlq001 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Huh? Alhaitham?
Media:vo ahlq001 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: It's kinda weird for you to be working with the matra. Is there a special reason?
Media:vo ahlq001 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Really? Paimon's surprised you have this much free time...
Media:vo ahlq001 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: In that case... Let's join in as well, shall we, (Traveler)?
Media:vo ahlq001 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Don't you worry! Our lips are sealed!
Media:vo ahlq001 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Oh, come on! We already said that we're coming!
Media:vo ahlq001 2 pia 01.ogg Piah: (My long-awaited time off...)
Media:vo ahlq001 2 rancho 01.ogg Rancho: (I wish I could travel to Mondstadt with her.)
Media:vo ahlq001 3 aarav 01.ogg Aarav: We're here, Acting Grand Sage Alhaitham. What's our next course of action?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 aarav 02.ogg Aarav: Acting Grand Sage Alhaitham?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 aarav 03.ogg Aarav: ...You're right. Understood! Then, please wait here as we lock down the perimeter and search for suspicious persons!
Media:vo ahlq001 3 aarav 04.ogg Aarav: Ilyas, please stay here. Acting Grand Sage Alhaitham, I'll have to trouble you with the protection of our primary witness.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 aarav 05.ogg Aarav: Acting Grand Sage Alhaitham, we've apprehended a suspect!
Media:vo ahlq001 3 aarav 06.ogg Aarav: No, it's the Kshahrewar researcher who has dealings with him. His name is Narendra.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 aarav 07.ogg Aarav: Of course.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 aarav 08.ogg Aarav: Perhaps Siraj was aware that Ilyas might leak information, so he intentionally didn't show up. Whatever the case, it seems that this lead ends here.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 aarav 09.ogg Aarav: The good news is regardless of what Siraj was planning, his progress will now be severely hindered by a lack of power generators and electrical components. We still have time to conduct our investigation.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 aarav 10.ogg Aarav: Do you have any more questions for the suspect?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 aarav 11.ogg Aarav: Oh, that's fine.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 aarav 12.ogg Aarav: We conducted a comprehensive lie detection exam, which showed that he has a genuine case of amnesia. We're not planning to pursue any further breakthroughs on that front.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 aarav 13.ogg Aarav: However, I am curious... What do you need him for, exactly?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 aarav 14.ogg Aarav: I see... We'll be returning to the Akademiya, then. I'll leave Ilyas in your care.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 aarav 15.ogg Aarav: (There is no room for laziness if we wish to uphold order.)
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: ...
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: Looks like you haven't read any memos lately.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: The new Akademiya decree clearly states that even a sage doesn't have the authority to interfere with the matra's actions during an ongoing investigation.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: If your superior were here, he wouldn't be asking me what to do. Instead, he'd be telling me to stay out of the way.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: Sure, though I'd rather he just protect himself.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: Answering a simplistic question only enables the questioner. Besides, I need him to understand my position clearly.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: Aarav has just as many doubts about my coming along as you do.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: But unlike you two, he's making this matter more complicated than it is, with his considerations like "the Acting Grand Sage is trying to seize the matra's powers."
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: That question was obviously bait. The matra were once under the influence of the sages, and so were often subject to these bureaucratic traps.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 10.ogg Alhaitham: The test was strictly unnecessary, though. I hope that our exchange will assure him that I won't interfere with their work this time.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 11.ogg Alhaitham: This is why I was against becoming the Acting Grand Sage from the very first. Titles and rank inevitably make a lot of things more troublesome than usual.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 12.ogg Alhaitham: No, I have no recollection of ever meeting you.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 13.ogg Alhaitham: Then why did you ask?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 14.ogg Alhaitham: Really?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 15.ogg Alhaitham: A misperception perhaps, or...
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 16.ogg Alhaitham: Siraj?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 17.ogg Alhaitham: I would like to ask him a few questions.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 18.ogg Alhaitham: Do you know Siraj?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 19.ogg Alhaitham: What were the details of this transaction?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 20.ogg Alhaitham: No, he's all yours, but I'd like to borrow Ilyas for a while.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 21.ogg Alhaitham: I've read some papers regarding amnesia, and I'd like to try restoring his memories.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 22.ogg Alhaitham: Follow me.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 23.ogg Alhaitham: I thought you would've guessed the reason by now.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 24.ogg Alhaitham: Yes. We were classmates.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 25.ogg Alhaitham: You couldn't be further from the truth, but I wasn't expecting much from you to begin with.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 26.ogg Alhaitham: For the time being, all you need to know is that we were once classmates. I became the scribe afterwards, while he continued his academic endeavors.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 27.ogg Alhaitham: He submitted a thesis one year ago, and the Grand Sage at the time asked for my opinion. I did not approve of it because it committed one of the six cardinal sins by touching upon human evolution.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 28.ogg Alhaitham: From violating matters regarding human evolution to attempting the forbidden and fearing none, the six cardinal sins are the origin of all evil in this world. They are also what the sages use as a reference when formulating or amending the rules of the Akademiya.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 29.ogg Alhaitham: My opinion was that Siraj's research was both overly naive and in violation of various core principles. The Grand Sage took some of my suggestions on board and ultimately decided to reject the application.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 30.ogg Alhaitham: He's most likely trying to circumvent the rules and conduct his experiment in secret.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 31.ogg Alhaitham: It is possible for a person to subconsciously forget some of their memories as a defense mechanism against extreme stress.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 32.ogg Alhaitham: However, these memories aren't truly lost, but merely sealed away. They can be restored with the appropriate stimulus.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 33.ogg Alhaitham: Now, try to recall things you care about. They don't need to be related to this case.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 34.ogg Alhaitham: Do tell.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 35.ogg Alhaitham: Not unexpected.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 36.ogg Alhaitham: However, you're the only one who has seen Siraj and knows the exact location of his cave at present. As such, we'll do everything we can to help you regain your memories.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 alhaitham 37.ogg Alhaitham: I see. In that case, let's go and find whoever's in charge there.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 01.ogg Ilyas: Excuse me, Acting Grand Sage Alhaitham.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 02.ogg Ilyas: I've had a question on my mind and I need to know the answer, no matter what... Have we met before?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 03.ogg Ilyas: Haha, I thought so, too... I probably wouldn't have had anything to do with someone of your caliber.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 04.ogg Ilyas: Well, for some reason, I felt a sense of familiarity when I met you for the first time.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 05.ogg Ilyas: I'm sorry, but I've already tried many times. And no matter how hard I try, it feels like everything in my mind is shrouded in a thick mist.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 06.ogg Ilyas: Actually... I feel like I've forgotten more than just the memories of the time I was kidnapped and experimented on.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 07.ogg Ilyas: The kind of person I am, the things I've done... I can remember some things, but I can't recall some others no matter how hard I try.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 08.ogg Ilyas: But, I do vaguely remember that there are two things that I have to do, no matter what.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 09.ogg Ilyas: The first is to get my paycheck from the Akademiya and give it to my younger sister in Gandharva Ville.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 10.ogg Ilyas: I'm not sure about the details... but it seems that I would send money to my younger sister every month to pay for family expenses.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 11.ogg Ilyas: ...I can't remember. Sorry, there's just so much I can't recall...
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 12.ogg Ilyas: Thank you so much. This feeling... It's more than just pain, but I don't know how to describe it...
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 13.ogg Ilyas: I have so few memories that I don't even have a clear idea of who I am... And my head's always ringing — it feels like I could faint at any moment.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 14.ogg Ilyas: But amidst all that... It also feels like I've been set free, somehow...
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 15.ogg Ilyas: Nevertheless, I have you all to thank for bringing me what clarity I do have right now.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 ilyas 16.ogg Ilyas: Now, I do remember that I worked part-time at a place in the Akademiya called the Research Preparation Center. That's also where I got my monthly paycheck.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 narandra 01.ogg Narendra: S—Acting Sage Alhaitham...?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 narandra 02.ogg Narendra: Wait, uh, can someone please explain what's going on? I admit that I did steal some mechanical components from the lab and sell them, but does something like that really warrant the personal interest of the Acting Grand Sage?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 narandra 03.ogg Narendra: What... What have I gotten myself into? I—I know I let greed get the best of me, but please, I promise that this won't ever happen again...
Media:vo ahlq001 3 narandra 04.ogg Narendra: Yeah, that's the name of my buyer. He asked to make the transaction at the tavern, but he never showed up...
Media:vo ahlq001 3 narandra 05.ogg Narendra: He's doing some kind of experiment that seems to require many power generators and electrical components that can only be found in our project.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 narandra 06.ogg Narendra: He contacted me in private and said that he'd pay a large sum of Mora if I was willing to put some aside for him, under the pretense of them being defective parts.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 narandra 07.ogg Narendra: We had originally agreed to meet at the tavern earlier today to do the trade. I sure didn't expect to get stood up or run into you all...
Media:vo ahlq001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: He's the same as ever... Casually ignoring people, just like he did back at Aaru Village!
Media:vo ahlq001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: ...Grr! Why is this so complicated!?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Siraj didn't show up at the tavern, and Narendra didn't give us any leads... That means we're stuck!
Media:vo ahlq001 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Alhaitham, are you serious about seeing things through? Paimon's pretty surprised that you're this interested in the case...
Media:vo ahlq001 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh? Paimon has no clue. Hey, do you know?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Ohh, so that's why you asked to come along when Aarav briefed you on the situation!
Media:vo ahlq001 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: So you're not here because you're interested in the case itself, but because you know the suspect?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: So that's why he's buying energy sources and electrical components...
Media:vo ahlq001 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: That sounds super suspicious... We gotta stop him!
Media:vo ahlq001 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Ilyas, can you try to remember things again? Maybe something new will pop up.
Media:vo ahlq001 3 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: And the second thing? What's the second thing?
Media:vo ahlq001 3 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Losing your memories must be really painful, but don't you worry! We'll help you get them all back!
Media:vo dialog ahlq001 pia 01.ogg Piah: That sounds great! Thanks a lot.
Media:vo dialog ahlq001 rancho 01.ogg Rancho: Say, an old friend of mine is also in Mondstadt. Why don't we go together? We can even ask him to be our guide and show us around.
There are a few other researchers discussing Alhaitham off to one side...
You meet a terribly bedraggled researcher...
You wait somewhat longer than expected...
