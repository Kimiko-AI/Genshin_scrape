Maruf: Hmm, the soup looks nice.
Maruf: Thank you, Traveler. Here, this is for you.
Maruf: When I'm finished, I'll try it myself first.

Maruf: Something feels off about this soup...
Maruf: Anyway, I'll try it first when it's done.
Maruf: Thank you, Traveler. Here, this is for you.

Zakariya: Um, I remember Maruf is treating a patient with...
 A headache.
Zakariya: Ah, I see. To treat headaches, the prescription that I gave him last time will do.
Zakariya: Brew up a herbal soup out of the ingredients listed in the prescription and add three portions of Mint.
Zakariya: After that, keep boiling the soup on a high flame for around... Forget it... Boil it until the ingredients float.

Zakariya: Um, I remember Maruf is treating a patient with...
 A stomachache.
Zakariya: Ah, I see. To treat stomachaches, the prescription that I gave him last time will do.
Zakariya: Brew up a herbal soup out of the raw ingredients listed in the prescription and add three Henna Berries.
Zakariya: After that, keep boiling the soup on a low flame until the ingredients become soft and mushy.

Zakariya: Um, I remember Maruf is treating a patient...
 Who can't see well.
Zakariya: Ah, I see. To treat someone with impaired vision, the prescription that I gave him last time would do.
Zakariya: Brew up a herbal soup out of raw ingredients listed in my prescription and add a Starshroom.
Zakariya: After that, keep boiling the soup on a high flame. In fact, I'd suggest a brief high flame first before leaving it on a low flame for a bit longer, until the soup deepens in color.
 A headache.
 A high flame first, and then a low flame.
 A stomachache.

 Does Zakariya ever come to the village?
Maruf: He occasionally has people send herbs and stuff over, but he's too busy to show up in person, really.
Maruf: Anyway, about that prescription — I'm counting on you, Traveler.
 Have you tried prescribing other medicine?
 Henna Berry.
 Is someone gravely ill?
 Leave it to me.
Maruf: I'm counting on you, Traveler.
 Mint.
 Quest DescriptionMaruf from Aaru Village seems to be having some trouble...
 Starshroom.
 Until the ingredients float.
 Until the ingredients turn mushy.
 Until the soup deepens in color.
 Who can't see well.
Maruf starts brewing the medicine...
Maruf: (*sigh* I must do something to reassure my patients...)
Maruf: *sigh* This condition is tricky. I'd better get Dr. Zakariya's help.
Maruf: Ah, Traveler, you're back! What did Zakariya say?
Maruf: Ahem... That would've been far beyond me. You see, with my limited experience, I can only come up with this many prescriptions...
Maruf: Anyway, I'll try it first when it's done.
Maruf: Anyway, about that prescription — I'm counting on you, Traveler.
Maruf: Could you watch my steps? Let me know if I make any mistakes.
Maruf: Eh? Ah, Traveler! Nobody's gravely ill. It's just that a (patient's got a severe case of headache/patient's got a severe case of stomachache/patient suddenly can't see well).
Maruf: Eh? His writing is, um, unsurprisingly still so hard to understand.
Maruf: For how long?
Maruf: Got it. Allow me to check the prescription one more time, just in case we missed something.
Maruf: He occasionally has people send herbs and stuff over, but he's too busy to show up in person, really.
Maruf: Hmm, the soup looks nice.
Maruf: How do I brew it?
Maruf: I gave him some medicine, but it didn't really work that well.
Maruf: I'm counting on you, Traveler.
Maruf: I've got some patients to attend to, so could you visit Dr. Zakariya in my stead and ask him to prescribe something?
Maruf: It says to use the soup he prescribed last time as the base? I see... Let me check the instructions more carefully.
Maruf: Luckily, Dr. Zakariya at Bimarstan has offered to prescribe medicine and get the ingredients ready for me...
Maruf: Something feels off about this soup...
Maruf: Thank you, Traveler. Here, this is for you.
Maruf: The ingredients are... Ugh... Totally unintelligible...
Maruf: They can treat mild conditions alright, but when it comes to serious ones, they're next to useless.
Maruf: Traveler, can I ask you a favor?
Maruf: Traveler, he told you how to brew it and what ingredients are needed, right?
Maruf: When I'm finished, I'll try it myself first.
You describe the condition Maruf is treating...
Zakariya writes down the prescription...
Zakariya: (Maruf's really carrying a heavy burden...)
Zakariya: *sigh* Actually, all Maruf had to do was to adjust his original prescription very slightly. Why couldn't he put more trust in himself?
(Obtain Zakariya's Prescription for Maruf)
Zakariya: *sigh* How many times have I told him? He's fully capable of handling something this simple on his own — without needing my help!

Zakariya: I bet the patients are exaggerating their discomfort again, thinking that a mere village doctor is unable to treat their "serious illness."
Zakariya: Looking after the villagers for so many years has definitely not been an easy task for Maruf... I'll write up a prescription right away. Please take note, Traveler.
Zakariya: Maruf? Did he run into some little-understood illness again?
Zakariya: One can be as creative as they want with the prescription. The worst thing they might end up with is a useless soup, that's all.
Zakariya: Please deliver the prescription to Maruf.
Zakariya: That's why Maruf wants my prescription to reassure them.
Zakariya: To be honest, I wouldn't say what I prescribed is "medicine." Instead, it's more of a... How should I put it...
Zakariya: Um, I remember Maruf is treating a patient with...
Zakariya: Um, I remember Maruf is treating a patient...
Zakariya: Um... Just in case you forget, I'll write it down.
Zakariya: Well, it's more of a mild, nutritious supplement.
Zakariya: Why am I having more and more patients lately...
