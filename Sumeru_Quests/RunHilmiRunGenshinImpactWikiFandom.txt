Hilmi: *huff* I—I won!
 C—Congratulations...
 You were... almost flying...
Hilmi: Hehe, I told you how good I am! You underestimated me, didn't you?
Ebeid: But even if we can run this fast, we can't outrun Habachi. I just don't understand why.

Hilmi: Huff... You ran so fast!
 Because I—I'm an adventurer...
 Because I've run many, many times.
Ebeid: We aren't fast enough. Habachi can definitely catch us... What do we do?
Hilmi: Besides, he's not even out of breath each time he catches us. He doesn't even look like he was running.
 Because I've run many, many times.
 Because I—I'm an adventurer...
 C—Congratulations...
 He might be playing some trick.
 I'm quite special and don't need that outfit.
 I'm too skilled to need that green outfit.
 Okay...
 Quest DescriptionYou can feel the eager eyes of the children...
 Sure. Let's run together.
 That's sort of accurate.
 There might be a shortcut.
 You can trust Habachi...
Ebeid: Play with us, please!
Ebeid: Play with us, please, nice (Mister/Miss)!
 Okay...
 You could say that.
 You were... almost flying...
Ebeid: (I must hurry up.)
Ebeid: (Mister/Miss)! Wait!
Ebeid: Ahem, anyway, if Habachi happens to be exhausted when the bad guys come, we'll shut down the lift for him.
Ebeid: Are you... an adventurer? I mean the kind of adventurers who are skilled in battle and travel to many places.
Ebeid: But even if we can run this fast, we can't outrun Habachi. I just don't understand why.
Ebeid: But the lift is some distance away from the warehouse. To shut it down, Habachi will have to run really fast.
Ebeid: Do you see that big warehouse in the village? Habachi said we must keep watch over it because many important things are kept there.
Ebeid: Go!
Ebeid: Hilmi, keep going! (Mister/Miss), keep going, too!
Ebeid: In that case, you can definitely help us!
Ebeid: Is that so? But I don't think there's any shortcut around.
Ebeid: Look, Hilmi! I said (he/she) must be an adventurer!
Ebeid: Play with us, please!
Ebeid: Play with us, please, nice (Mister/Miss)!
Ebeid: Ready...
Ebeid: We aren't fast enough. Habachi can definitely catch us... What do we do?
Ebeid: We thought we could train with him, but he's been ignoring our offer...
Ebeid: Wow!
Ebeid: Yay! Thank you!
Ebeid: You're an adventurer, so you must be a fast runner, too! Please train with us.
Ebeid: You're right! Since we can't outrun Habachi, we can get around him...
Hilmi: (Hehe, I'm the fastest!)
Hilmi: (Mister/Miss), can you play with us next time...
Hilmi: *huff* I—I won!
Hilmi: Besides, he's not even out of breath each time he catches us. He doesn't even look like he was running.
Hilmi: But don't adventurers always wear those green outfits?
Hilmi: He also told us that if any bad guys come, he'll shut down the lift and cut off the bridge.
Hilmi: Hehe, I told you how good I am! You underestimated me, didn't you?
Hilmi: Hehe, I will be your rival. For the record, I'm a really good runner!
Hilmi: How I wish he could instead ignore us when we try to sneak out to skip stones! Like that's gonna happen... Hmph!
Hilmi: Huff... You ran so fast!
Hilmi: I mean... train with us! Um... Let's train that "tracking in the wilderness" thing!
Hilmi: We tried that before, didn't we? But it never worked...
Hilmi: We've chosen the starting point. Let's go there!
Hilmi: Wow!
Paimon: Whoa, gone just like that! Hurry, catch up with him!
Paimon: You can do it! But don't push yourself too hard...
