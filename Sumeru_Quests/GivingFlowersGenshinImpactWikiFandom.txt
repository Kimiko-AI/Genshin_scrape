 (It could be an Aranara.)

 (That should be an Aranara.)

Paimon: A garden full of Sweet Flowers, huh... Ooh, Paimon remembers that there were many in the garden we took care of for the Aranara!
Varsha: Wait. Are you saying that there really is a paradise like that out there, Paimon?
Paimon: Yup! And believe it or not, the "forest spirit" that saved you is from a species called the Aranara.
Paimon: We know this, 'cause we've helped plant many Viparyas for them.
 We helped the earth to remember.
Paimon: That's right. According to Aranakula, Vanarana remembers everything, so the Viparyas can sprout in the garden once the land remembers them again.
Varsha: ...I've heard a lot of stories like this before, and only kids take them seriously. But I know you said this with good intentions, Paimon, so thank you.
Paimon: Aren't you a kid as well? And Paimon's not telling stories. Paimon means it for real!
Varsha: Yeah. That's what every storyteller says.
Paimon: If you don't believe us... Well, seeing is believing! Come with us and see for yourself!
Varsha: Wait, you've really prepared a place to fit your story? Now I'm getting curious.
Paimon: Ugh, Paimon's telling you the truth...
Paimon: Let's take her to the Aranara's garden, (Traveler). That should silence her doubts once and for all.

Paimon: What a sweet daydream she's having, eh...
Varsha: Anyway, I am much happier now than when I was in Gandharva Ville, and I don't get beaten... I appreciate your kindness. But right now, it'd be for the best if you left me alone...
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon doesn't know what she's been through, but it seems like it would be hard to convince her to return.
Paimon: To be fair, things don't look too dangerous around here... Let's come back and see her later if chance allows. Maybe she'll have changed her mind by then.

 (That should be an Aranara.)
 (There's a story behind this for sure...)
 But...
 Quest DescriptionThere are so many Sweet Flowers in Vanarana's garden now. Varsha would be ecstatic to see it for herself for sure.
 Running into dangerous Fungi.
 There really is a garden full of Sweet Flowers.
 We helped the earth to remember.
 We're just a pair of kind travelers.
Paimon: Exactly. And that's why we don't leave those who are troubled behind.
 We're looking for my lost (sister/brother)...
Paimon: Yes. So of course we got worried when we saw a little girl like you here all alone! We just can't leave you like this knowing that you might need help.
 You might run into bad guys that might try to kidnap you.
(Talk to Varsha after completing The Viparyas of Vanarana)
Paimon: Hi Varsha! You're still here, huh?
Varsha: Paimon. (Traveler). Good to see you. I'm doing well here. There's nothing for you to worry about.
Paimon: You've persevered, huh...
Varsha: Are you still trying to persuade me? I'm not going anywhere with you. Not at all...
Paimon: Well... we're not gonna force you to do anything. Remember what you said about "a garden full of Sweet Flowers"?
Varsha: Ah... It was a wishful thinking actually. I know there isn't such a place.
Paimon: Hmm... This maturity still feels weird coming from a kid.
Paimon: Guess what? We've got good news!
 There really is a garden full of Sweet Flowers.

Paimon: Ugh, Paimon's telling you the truth...
Paimon: Let's take her to the Aranara's garden, (Traveler). That should silence her doubts once and for all.
(Talk to Varsha prior to completing Viparyas of Vanarana)
Varsha: As long as there are seeds, I can grow more Sweet Flowers. But bread is different. You can't plant bread.
Varsha: If bread could break in half and grow back again, no one would ever go hungry...
???: Ah! A weird person, and a weird flying person.
???: Yeah, that's right. Rude's my middle name. Didn't even have parents to teach me "manners," don'cha know?
Paimon: (That said, could "that guy from Vimara Village" refer to...)
Paimon: A garden full of Sweet Flowers, huh... Ooh, Paimon remembers that there were many in the garden we took care of for the Aranara!
Paimon: And why are you here all alone, Varsha? We can escort you back if you're lost.
Paimon: Anyway, it's still not safe for kids to be alone in the forest. You might encounter all kinds of dangers, like...
Paimon: Aren't you a kid as well? And Paimon's not telling stories. Paimon means it for real!
Paimon: Don't run so fast, Varsha!
Paimon: Eh?
Paimon: Exactly. And that's why we don't leave those who are troubled behind.
Paimon: Guess what? We've got good news!
Paimon: Hey, hey! That's rude!
Paimon: Hi Varsha! You're still here, huh?
Paimon: Hmm... Anyway, we aren't weird people, and we definitely aren't bad guys.
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon doesn't know what she's been through, but it seems like it would be hard to convince her to return.
Paimon: Hmm... This maturity still feels weird coming from a kid.
Paimon: If you don't believe us... Well, seeing is believing! Come with us and see for yourself!
Paimon: Let's take her to the Aranara's garden, (Traveler). That should silence her doubts once and for all.
Paimon: Paimon's name is Paimon, and this is (Traveler). Might we know your name?
Paimon: Strange, what's this kid doing here? Hey kid! Why are you here all alone?
Paimon: That's right. According to Aranakula, Vanarana remembers everything, so the Viparyas can sprout in the garden once the land remembers them again.
Paimon: The Aranara are the ones who take the kidnapped kids back to Vimara Village.
Paimon: To be fair, things don't look too dangerous around here... Let's come back and see her later if chance allows. Maybe she'll have changed her mind by then.
Paimon: Ugh, Paimon's telling you the truth...
Paimon: Ugh... Yes and no. It's Aranakula and Arakara who tend to this garden together. We just helped out a little on the side. It is not built just for made-up stories.
Paimon: Uh... Listen here, Varsha, you are safe here in Vanarana. But you are still a kid, so please take care of yourself.
Paimon: Vanarana is not actually dangerous, but are you sure you don't want to go back to Gandharva Ville?
Paimon: Varsha just can't sit still for even a second... Let's go, (Traveler).
Paimon: We know this, 'cause we've helped plant many Viparyas for them.
Paimon: Well, if you insist...
Paimon: Well... we're not gonna force you to do anything. Remember what you said about "a garden full of Sweet Flowers"?
Paimon: What a sweet daydream she's having, eh...
Paimon: What's with this old-person talk...? You are just a kid! Anyway, the forest can be pretty dangerous. A kid like you isn't gonna be able to handle it.
Paimon: Yeah! And villains such as Nara Marana. Ugh, no, Paimon meant to say...
Paimon: Yes! And believe it or not, the "forest spirit" that saved you is from a species called Aranara.
Paimon: Yes! You finally believe Paimon now? Not only did we help to take care of the garden, but we also went on adventures with the Aranara!
Paimon: Yes. So of course we got worried when we saw a little girl like you here all alone! We just can't leave you like this knowing that you might need help.
Paimon: You almost got taken away by some bad guy!? You haven't learned your lesson at all, then! Wait, and how did you manage to get away last time, anyway?
Paimon: You've persevered, huh...
Paimon: Yup! And believe it or not, the "forest spirit" that saved you is from a species called the Aranara.
Paimon: Yup! What (Traveler) said! Or... or you might starve!
Varsha: (Aranara... hehe.)
Varsha: (Heh, living alone isn't that difficult!)
Varsha: ...I've heard a lot of stories like this before, and only kids take them seriously. But I know you said this with good intentions, Paimon, so thank you.
Varsha: Ah... It was a wishful thinking actually. I know there isn't such a place.
Varsha: Alright, don't worry about me. I've manage to live on my own so far, remember?
Varsha: And I am a great caretaker of plants. The Aranara would be happy to see the garden flourishing here!
Varsha: And I've always been pretty good at taking care of plants, so finding a safe place to plant some Sweet Flowers or Mints to feed myself won't be a problem.
Varsha: Anyway, I am much happier now than when I was in Gandharva Ville, and I don't get beaten... I appreciate your kindness. But right now, it'd be for the best if you left me alone...
Varsha: Aranakula and Arakara... They are the "Aranara," the forest spirits?
Varsha: Are you still trying to persuade me? I'm not going anywhere with you. Not at all...
Varsha: As long as there are seeds, I can grow more Sweet Flowers. But bread is different. You can't plant bread.
Varsha: Come on over, Paimon! You too, (Traveler)!
Varsha: Did you prepare all this, Paimon and (Traveler)?
Varsha: Haha, a garden full of Sweet Flowers... Wouldn't that be paradise?
Varsha: He was a guy from Vimara Village, and he looked nice enough. But as it turns out, he was no different from those adults I met before...
Varsha: I can't rely on adults. I must go my own way...
Varsha: I know, I know. You two take care as well!
Varsha: If bread could break in half and grow back again, no one would ever go hungry...
Varsha: It's impossible to starve in a forest full of nature's gifts. Starshrooms, Sweet Flowers, and Mints are everywhere, and I eat like a bird anyway.
Varsha: It's still hard to believe the stories though... But if I stay here, will I have a chance to see them too?
Varsha: My name's Varsha...
Varsha: No. The past should stay in the past. I've decided to move on.
Varsha: Paimon. (Traveler). Good to see you. I'm doing well here. There's nothing for you to worry about.
Varsha: Some bad guy tried to take me away earlier... But it's okay. I'm more careful now. I'll be able to avoid danger.
Varsha: Some small creature whisked me to this place. I've never seen something this small in Gandharva Ville, so I believe that it had to be a forest spirit.
Varsha: The flowers are coming along very well here!
Varsha: Wait, you've really prepared a place to fit your story? Now I'm getting curious.
Varsha: Wait. Are you saying that there really is a paradise like that out there, Paimon?
Varsha: Wow, there are so many Sweet Flowers!
Varsha: Yeah. That's what every storyteller says.
Varsha: You have a memory like a sieve, Paimon. I said I couldn't rely on adults and that I want to go my own way.
Varsha: You're such a worrywart, Paimon. No one has cared about me this much for as long as I can remember.
