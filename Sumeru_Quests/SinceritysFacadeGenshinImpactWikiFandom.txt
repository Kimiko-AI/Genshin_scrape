 All on Paimon's tab.
 But isn't that also a good thing?
 Everything just happened so fast.
 I also don't want to see his efforts go to waste.
 I don't want you to stop going forward.
 I've fought through many situations like this before.
 It's always more fun when everyone's together.
 It's really my treat, but you get the point.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 paimon 04b 1.ogg Paimon: Hey, this way you get something from the both of us for the price of one!
 Probably not.
 Quest DescriptionThe truth is revealed. Dehya's father has long passed. Still, his comrades in arms seek to avenge him. Before judgment falls, Dehya decides to lend them her aid.
 She rarely spends her allowance on other people.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 paimon 04a 1.ogg Paimon: Hey, c'mon! Paimon's not that stingy!
 Step DescriptionThe matter behind Deshret's Relics has finally been settled for good. But Dehya, who learned of what consumed the remainder of her father's life, now finds herself stripped of ability to smile as she once did.
 We got you some snacks and drinks.
 What an... interesting man.
 You don't need to read it out loud.
 You should never question your true feelings, though.
Cutscene's Travel Log summary:
You find the cane Kusayla left behind. Everyone is surprised when Dehya pulls an old blade out from it. The mercenaries recognized it as the toy sword Kusayla had used when he and little Dehya performed fairy tales together.In one of those stories, Dehya slew a dragon with the sword, but she was reluctant to say the victory lines, and Kusayla was forced to give the speech himself. Many years have passed, and Dehya, whose heart is filled with mixed feelings at the sight of this memento, decides to make up for her regrets."I hereby... proclaim our victory...""Evil shall plague us no more... Dad."
(Dehya pulls an old blade out of the cane)
Dehya: Thought so...
Tikriti: Wait...
Tikriti: Isn't that the toy sword you played with as a child?
(Flashback to Dehya's childhood starts)
Kusayla: Ahem! The dragon is no more
Kusayla: For Princess Dehya has slain it
Kusayla: Its head now hangs above the city gates
Kusayla: Her bravery has brought eternal peace and prosperity to us all
Kusayla: Dehya, come on! This is the most important line!
Dehya: Um, um... You can do it
Kusayla: But Dehya, YOU defeated the dragon! Everyone's waiting for your speech!
Kusayla: Hehe, still too shy, huh... Alright, I'll do it
Kusayla: I hereby proclaim our victory! Evil shall plague us no more!
(Flashback ends)
Dehya: I hereby... proclaim our victory...
Dehya: Evil shall plague us no more... Dad
(Cinematic Ends)
Dehya: Evil shall plague us no more... Dad
Dehya: I hereby... proclaim our victory...
Dehya: Thought so...
Dehya: Um, um... You can do it
Everyone searches around the room...
Kusayla: Ahem! The dragon is no more
Kusayla: But Dehya, YOU defeated the dragon! Everyone's waiting for your speech!
Kusayla: Dehya, come on! This is the most important line!
Kusayla: For Princess Dehya has slain it
Kusayla: Hehe, still too shy, huh... Alright, I'll do it
Kusayla: Her bravery has brought eternal peace and prosperity to us all
Kusayla: I hereby proclaim our victory! Evil shall plague us no more!
Kusayla: Its head now hangs above the city gates
Media:vo dhylq002 9 ayoub 01.ogg Ayyoub: (I guess it all comes down to this. Ah, my son...)
Media:vo dhylq002 9 mirza 01.ogg Mirza: (Deshret's Relics are about to become history.)
Media:vo dhylq003 10 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Should be. I don't think they have enough manpower left to post guards and defend their perimeters.
Media:vo dhylq003 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Is this the entrance? We sure didn't run into much trouble on the way here.
Media:vo dhylq003 11 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Who cares? We'll round up all of 'em.
Media:vo dhylq003 11 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Yeah, we'll know what they're really capable of once we've landed some hits on 'em.
Media:vo dhylq003 11 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Deshret's Relics may have been a force to be reckoned with before, but their name means nothing now.
Media:vo dhylq003 11 idrisi 01.ogg Idrisi: They should all be holed up in here. Dunno how many people they've got left, though.
Media:vo dhylq003 11 idrisi 02.ogg Idrisi: Yeah, they don't stand a chance with you here. I'll take the lead, I've been here once before.
Media:vo dhylq003 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow, Paimon didn't expect it to look like this on the inside...
Media:vo dhylq003 11 tikriti 01.ogg Tikriti: Still, we should be careful. Even if they've only got one shot left, it could still take us out.
Media:vo dhylq003 12 bashar 02.ogg Bashar: It seems like we just got trapped in here... don't think we triggered anything else.
Media:vo dhylq003 12 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Hey! You guys okay?
Media:vo dhylq003 12 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Let's see...
Media:vo dhylq003 12 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: I think I see a way through over there, but it's being blocked by something. Let's try our luck with that mechanism.
Media:vo dhylq003 12 idrisi 01.ogg Idrisi: This way, follow me! We're almost there!
Media:vo dhylq003 12 idrisi 02.ogg Idrisi: Watch out, the enemy's coming from ahead!
Media:vo dhylq003 12 idrisi 03.ogg Idrisi: Don't worry about us, we knew something like this could happen! Go and take a look around — there could still be another way through!
Media:vo dhylq003 12 idrisi 04.ogg Idrisi: Let's go, we can't let the boss down!
Media:vo dhylq003 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wait, they went charging ahead without checking for any traps!
Media:vo dhylq003 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's check if there's another way! The sooner we can make it through to help them, the better!
Media:vo dhylq003 12 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Okay, let's go!
Media:vo dhylq003 12 tikriti 02.ogg Tikriti: Well, now that things have come to this, seems we'll have to fight our way through.
Media:vo dhylq003 12 together 01.ogg Crowd: Ugh!
Media:vo dhylq003 13 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Another mechanism like the one before, but this one's being blocked off in the middle.
Media:vo dhylq003 13 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Don't waste your breath. You have nowhere to run.
Media:vo dhylq003 13 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Hmph... so you want to go out in a blaze of glory.
Media:vo dhylq003 13 michaal 01.ogg Mishal: I wasn't expecting anyone to make it through from the other side.
Media:vo dhylq003 13 michaal 02.ogg Mishal: But as a desert-dweller, I suppose we should be used to our folks defying all expectations.
Media:vo dhylq003 13 michaal 03.ogg Mishal: Run? Heh, had I wanted to run, I would have fled a thousand times already.
Media:vo dhylq003 13 michaal 04.ogg Mishal: I witnessed the golden age of Deshret's Relics. Even if I could leave this place behind, all that awaits me now are endless days of humiliation and ruin.
Media:vo dhylq003 13 michaal 05.ogg Mishal: Even now, my brothers and I still believe in one thing.
Media:vo dhylq003 13 michaal 06.ogg Mishal: "The greatest should never live to remember their fall."
Media:vo dhylq003 13 michaal 07a.ogg Mishal: Let us draw our weapons. We will show them the true power King Deshret bestowed upon his followers.
Media:vo dhylq003 13 michaal 08.ogg Mishal: They are but two, while we hold within ourselves the entirety of the Relics' glory.
Media:vo dhylq003 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We just need to adjust it a little!
Media:vo dhylq003 14 bashar 01.ogg Bashar: Come and face me, Mishal!
Media:vo dhylq003 14 bashar 02.ogg Bashar: We were too late...
Media:vo dhylq003 14 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Do you all just want to die!?
Media:vo dhylq003 14 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: The commander has finally fallen.
Media:vo dhylq003 14 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: When the next wave comes, try to draw away their attacks.
Media:vo dhylq003 14 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: I'm going to see if I can take out that high platform.
Media:vo dhylq003 14 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: ...It's over, there's no more need to fight.
Media:vo dhylq003 14 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: But if you're still going to cling onto your so-called mercenaries' pride, then I'll give you all a good beating as well.
Media:vo dhylq003 14 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: Let's go.
Media:vo dhylq003 14 hamzah 01a.ogg Hamzah: Wave one, charge! Eliminate them!
Media:vo dhylq003 14 hamzah 02.ogg Hamzah: Don't think that you've won. We're just getting started!
Media:vo dhylq003 14 hamzah 03.ogg Hamzah: King Deshret will not abandon any one of his followers!
Media:vo dhylq003 14 hamzah 04.ogg Hamzah: Brothers, with me! This is where we'll prove our faith!
Media:vo dhylq003 14 hamzah 05.ogg Hamzah: None of us planned to leave this place alive!
Media:vo dhylq003 14 hesitatingmercenary 01.ogg Hesitant Mercenary: ...
Media:vo dhylq003 14 idrisi 01.ogg Idrisi: Get out of my way!
Media:vo dhylq003 14 idrisi 02.ogg Idrisi: Time to pay for everything you've done, Mishal.
Media:vo dhylq003 14 idrisi 03.ogg Idrisi: Hey, wait!
Media:vo dhylq003 14 michaal 02.ogg Mishal: Yes, keep fighting! There's no need to fear, and no need to back down. This is our last stand!
Media:vo dhylq003 14 michaal 03.ogg Mishal: Ah, so they've broken through the front as well...
Media:vo dhylq003 14 michaal 04.ogg Mishal: So, it would seem like this is the end.
Media:vo dhylq003 14 michaal 05.ogg Mishal: Heh, you think I would give you that opportunity?
Media:vo dhylq003 14 michaal 06.ogg Mishal: I will be buried in the sand alongside all the rest of our fading glory.
Media:vo dhylq003 14 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: But they're still coming at us!
Media:vo dhylq003 14 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: This place is like a gladiator's ring... They just keep coming, no matter how many we beat!
Media:vo dhylq003 14 scaredmercenary 01.ogg Scared Mercenary: Apologies, Mishal, they just — they fight like absolute mad men! No matter how much we throw at them, they just keep coming for more!
Media:vo dhylq003 14 scaredmercenary 02.ogg Scared Mercenary: ARGH!
Media:vo dhylq003 14 tikriti 01.ogg Tikriti: Hey, Dehya! I've found the mechanism. I'll get you all back up here right away!
Media:vo dhylq003 15 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Hah, you call yourself a member of the infamous Deshret's Relics, and you still can't even tell who's made it all the way to your headquarters?
Media:vo dhylq003 15 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: This is your last chance to talk.
Media:vo dhylq003 15 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: The irony.
Media:vo dhylq003 15 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: His life became a light for so many, yet to others, it wasn't even worth remembering.
Media:vo dhylq003 15 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: Where's the records room? Answer me.
Media:vo dhylq003 15 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: I mean the old records room.
Media:vo dhylq003 15 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: Stop wasting our time. Every one of us here is perfectly aware of what he had done.
Media:vo dhylq003 15 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: Tell me. Where is the old records room?
Media:vo dhylq003 15 idrisi 01.ogg Idrisi: Hey, have you ever heard of a man by the name of Kusayla?
Media:vo dhylq003 15 idrisi 02.ogg Idrisi: Watch your mouth! That's our boss you're talking about!
Media:vo dhylq003 15 idrisi 03.ogg Idrisi: Bashar, Tikriti, let's go. We'll leave the others here to guard these guys.
Media:vo dhylq003 15 idrisi 04.ogg Idrisi: Spare them no mercy if they try anything.
Media:vo dhylq003 15 shakhbout 01.ogg Shakhbout: Who are you filthy rats, and why are you always pestering us?
Media:vo dhylq003 15 shakhbout 02.ogg Shakhbout: Who knows what intent a bunch of rats may have? We try to catch a couple, and you all just show up on the other side instead. How are we supposed to figure out what you're after?
Media:vo dhylq003 15 shakhbout 03.ogg Shakhbout: Wh—Why would I know? It's not like I'm in charge or anything!
Media:vo dhylq003 15 shakhbout 04.ogg Shakhbout: H—Hey, I said I don't know anything! I'm just an average member here. I'm telling the truth!
Media:vo dhylq003 15 shakhbout 05.ogg Shakhbout: If you're here to find someone, why don't you look through the records yourselves? Who can remember every name and face with so many people coming in and out every day?
Media:vo dhylq003 15 shakhbout 06.ogg Shakhbout: It's right over there, all the files are in there! You can go through them as much as you want, it's not like any of them still matter anyway!
Media:vo dhylq003 15 shakhbout 07.ogg Shakhbout: Th—The old records room? You mean... the one that got burned down?
Media:vo dhylq003 15 shakhbout 08.ogg Shakhbout: Kusayla! Ah yeah, I remember him now. The guy who could hardly walk!
Media:vo dhylq003 15 shakhbout 09.ogg Shakhbout: He was definitely faking it! We all let down our guard as soon as we saw him come hobbling in...
Media:vo dhylq003 15 shakhbout 10.ogg Shakhbout: But in the short time it supposedly took him to take a dump, he'd already gotten away, and started a fire in the records room...
Media:vo dhylq003 15 shakhbout 11.ogg Shakhbout: He couldn't have possibly outrun us if he wasn't a fraud!
Media:vo dhylq003 15 shakhbout 12.ogg Shakhbout: ...And after that, Deshret's Relics fell into complete disarray.
Media:vo dhylq003 15 shakhbout 13.ogg Shakhbout: It's just over there, go see it for yourself if it means that much to you!
Media:vo dhylq003 15 shakhbout 14.ogg Shakhbout: There's nothing left in there but ashes. No human could ever survive that kind of inferno.
Media:vo dhylq003 16 bashar 01.ogg Bashar: Thanks for everything, boss.
Media:vo dhylq003 16 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: So this was his final destination.
Media:vo dhylq003 16 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: How did he do it...? Getting past all the guards with a limp, and sneaking in here to start a fire...
Media:vo dhylq003 16 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: If he was nimble enough to do that, then he must've been able to get out of here after starting the fire, right?
Media:vo dhylq003 16 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: I'm sorry, I know it's just wishful thinking. Let's look around. Maybe we can find something that's been left behind.
Media:vo dhylq003 16 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: ...
Media:vo dhylq003 16 idrisi 01.ogg Idrisi: Kusayla...
Media:vo dhylq003 16 idrisi 02.ogg Idrisi: Let's split up and look around some more. What if something else has been left behind?
Media:vo dhylq003 16 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Dehya...
Media:vo dhylq003 16 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmm? Is this a cane? It must be the one that Dehya's father used...
Media:vo dhylq003 16 tikriti 01.ogg Tikriti: We're fortunate to somehow find that cane after that fire.
Media:vo dhylq003 16 tikriti 02.ogg Tikriti: But what else could survive a fire like that?
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Wh—What's this?
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Aw, thanks, you two. Honestly, this is very unlike me. I just had a lot on my mind on our way back, so I didn't know what to say...
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: My chest was filled with all kinds of intense emotions. They just shook me even more than all the feelings we've shared during our previous adventures.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: But when everything came to an end, those emotions also vanished without a trace, and I was left feeling more empty than ever before.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: It was as if... I'd lost the thing that was most important to me.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: Yeah, you're right. To many mercenaries, Mora is the most important thing in the world. But perhaps to us, it's the most worthless thing of all.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: Idrisi and the others all used to say that they would quit if there was no Mora to be had. But when it came to avenging my father, there was no Mora to be made anywhere.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: My reality shattered when I found out that the father who always told me hero stories was in fact a bad guy, but look at me now... am I any different?
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: Despite all my promises about never forgiving him, and never trying to understand him, I still went to such lengths to find out the truth, and nearly even shed tears for his sake...
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: We're hypocrites, all of us.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 11.ogg Dehya: Yeah, you're right. It's just a pity that we often only recognize our true feelings after it's already too late.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 12.ogg Dehya: It's alright, my lady. You were hurt by all of this as well. Truth be told, I'm starting to feel a little guilty, watching you cry like this...
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 13.ogg Dehya: Hey, don't worry about me. If anything, this whole thing has finally shown me the difference between illusion and reality.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 14.ogg Dehya: My father probably thought that people could settle into new lives as long as they moved to a new environment.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 15.ogg Dehya: That thought has even crossed my mind a few times. It's like saying, "what's wrong with adapting to a new life?"
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 16.ogg Dehya: However, there was always something deep within my mind that refused to accept it. This impulse brought me great turmoil, and even made me feel ashamed for turning my back on your father's kindness...
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 17.ogg Dehya: But now that I consider it again, it all makes sense. The desert sands are a part of who I am, and I will never be able to lead a peaceful existence.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 18.ogg Dehya: That doesn't mean I won't be making any changes to my life, though. As an example, I'm now thinking about taking on some small, odd jobs.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 19.ogg Dehya: It's just like Idrisi said... I also want to catch up to my father, and become a character in his play.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 20.ogg Dehya: Even if the ending of the story may be childish and ridiculous, it won't really matter...
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 21.ogg Dehya: Right, you said you wanted to get a rug for your family...
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dehya 22.ogg Dehya: Haha, I can't thank you enough for taking care of me this entire time.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: You're back! Are all of you alright?
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: Yeah... Many people from the Corps of Thirty came over, and I just wrapped up everything with my dad. All I can do now is wait for their verdict...
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: Huh? Dehya, you're looking quite down again.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: I'm sorry, I really should have controlled my emotions better, I just... I just...
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dunyarzad 05.ogg Dunyarzad: But Dehya, your pain must be even worse. You shouldn't need to comfort me.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dunyarzad 06.ogg Dunyarzad: I understand how you feel.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dunyarzad 07.ogg Dunyarzad: Isn't that neat though? You'll be a whole new kind of mercenary, one that's not out for Mora!
Media:vo dhylq003 17 dunyarzad 08.ogg Dunyarzad: Why don't we go for a change of scenery once we finish eating? What about stopping by the Grand Bazaar again?
Media:vo dhylq003 17 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Don't you remember? You asked Paimon what she would do if she were to wake up tomorrow with loads of money!
Media:vo dhylq003 17 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: And Paimon said that she would get boatloads of tasty snacks! You looked super confused at the time, but said it was an adorable thing to say!
Media:vo dhylq003 17 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: These opportunities don't come by often, so today, Paimon's gonna treat you to a special crash course on Paimon's life philosophy!
Media:vo dhylq003 17 paimon 04a 1.ogg Paimon: Hey, c'mon! Paimon's not that stingy!
Media:vo dhylq003 17 paimon 04b 1.ogg Paimon: Hey, this way you get something from the both of us for the price of one!
Media:vo dhylq003 17 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Anyway, the point is that you should eat to your heart's content! You'll feel better for sure once you've gotten something in your tummy!
Media:vo dhylq003 17 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Dunyarzad will also be here shortly! She's already heard that we're back.
Media:vo dhylq003 17 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Ah, there she is!
Media:vo dhylq003 17 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Paimon will explain! A lot happened while we were gone...
Media:vo dhylq003 17 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: We'll come along, too!
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Ah, so you probably got there after us...
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: ...Thank you.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Well, back in the day, the first thing he did with any Mora was spend it on things like drinks and meat.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: But let's see what's inside...
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: Wh—What's this? It's just a bunch of junk! ...Ugh, it kinda stinks...
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: A handwritten copy of a storybook... The paper's already yellowed, and it looks like it's about to fall apart...
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: It was against the Akademiya's rules to possess books for personal use. If he was going to break that rule, he could have at least copied something useful...
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: Ah, and here are a few bags of children's snacks... the packaging's completely deteriorated. Maybe that's where the smell was coming from.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: Yeah, but here's the thing though... Even when I was a child, I was never a fan of these kinds of snacks. He'd always say that he got them for me, but in the end, he always ate more than I ever did...
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: Who even leaves snacks in a box like this, anyway? Isn't that just common sense...
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 11.ogg Dehya: Forget it, let me see what else is here...
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 12.ogg Dehya: A razor, some buttons, some round iron tiles, a wooden toy puppet...
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 13.ogg Dehya: A wool scarf, which from the looks of it probably belonged to a woman, and a hair clip... why are these things here?
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 14.ogg Dehya: I'm sorry, my lady, but this is just the kind of man he was. He probably saw this box as some kind of personal trash heap, and dumped any and everything in here...
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 15.ogg Dehya: One, no, two empty liquor bottles... Ugh, tell me you guys, are these the kinds of things that a normal person would leave behind?
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 16.ogg Dehya: Oh, you're right...
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 17.ogg Dehya: ...Alright, I got it out. It seems to be a piece of paper with some writing on it. The bottom part's all damaged from moisture, though... let's hope the writing didn't smudge.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 18.ogg Dehya: "I was suddenly seized with an urge to write a letter after finishing this bottle. I just folded it up and left it in the bottle, though. If I end up forgetting about it, it won't really matter."
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 19.ogg Dehya: "To Dehya..." It's a letter for me?
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 20.ogg Dehya: It's alright, I'll just read it out. If he went to the trouble of writing a letter, there must have been some important things that he wanted to say... or at least, record down.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 21.ogg Dehya: Hah, can you believe this guy? He can point the finger at himself.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 22.ogg Dehya: I... I don't know...

Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 27.ogg Dehya: Yeah. It's just a pity that we had to learn the truth of everything like this.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 28.ogg Dehya: I do. If he first found me alone in the sands, then I want to try my hand at finding the person who abandoned me.

Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 30.ogg Dehya: ...That there once existed a childish and foolish jerk with a heart of gold.

Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 32.ogg Dehya: Sure, I appreciate it. I wasn't expecting you to be so enthusiastic.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 33.ogg Dehya: ...Thank you, all of you. Thank you so much.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dehya 34.ogg Dehya: My life has certainly had its twists and turns, but I've always considered myself lucky.

Media:vo dhylq003 18 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: This rug here is quite something... the craftsmanship is exquisite, and the fabric is also of high quality.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: Uhh... perhaps it's just been left unopened for too long?
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: Did he get those for you?

Media:vo dhylq003 18 dunyarzad 06.ogg Dunyarzad: He was a good father to you. The fact that he wasn't a blood relative doesn't change that.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dunyarzad 07.ogg Dunyarzad: Do you already have some ideas about the decision that he wanted you to make?
Media:vo dhylq003 18 dunyarzad 08.ogg Dunyarzad: I'll help too!
Media:vo dhylq003 18 kusayla 01.ogg Kusayla's Letter: "My condition's becoming worse and worse. Can't even walk without a cane anymore, much less go out and have fun. Guess I don't have many days left."
Media:vo dhylq003 18 kusayla 02.ogg Kusayla's Letter: "If you're reading this letter, then I suppose I'm already long gone."
Media:vo dhylq003 18 kusayla 03.ogg Kusayla's Letter: "You were adorable as a baby. Everyone loved you, and regardless of whether you were crying or laughing, everyone enjoyed having you in the group."
Media:vo dhylq003 18 kusayla 04.ogg Kusayla's Letter: "But once you grew a bit older, you were no longer nearly as happy or cute. It's probably Idrisi's fault, he was never up to any good..."
Media:vo dhylq003 18 kusayla 05.ogg Kusayla's Letter: "Anyway, back to the point... To summarize, I'm writing this so you would know not to feel sad for me even if you end up finding out the truth."
Media:vo dhylq003 18 kusayla 06.ogg Kusayla's Letter: "The reason being that... Heh, I was never your father to begin with."

Media:vo dhylq003 18 kusayla 10.ogg Kusayla's Letter: "You were just lying there, small and helpless. You were so tiny that if the wind blew for just a little while longer, you would have been buried forever."
Media:vo dhylq003 18 kusayla 11.ogg Kusayla's Letter: "But your cries were so loud, they made my head hurt. Now that I think of it, you really were a bundle of energy."
Media:vo dhylq003 18 kusayla 12.ogg Kusayla's Letter: "I told Idrisi and the others that I had slipped up with a woman while out and about. None of them even doubted me."
Media:vo dhylq003 18 kusayla 13.ogg Kusayla's Letter: "I'm sorry that I had to lie to them for so long, but I really had no other choice."
Media:vo dhylq003 18 kusayla 14.ogg Kusayla's Letter: "I was their most esteemed leader, after all. It's not like I could just tell them that I suddenly wanted to play at being a father..."
Media:vo dhylq003 18 kusayla 15.ogg Kusayla's Letter: "Haha, at this rate, I'll puke up all the liquor I just drank from this bottle."

Media:vo dhylq003 18 kusayla 17.ogg Kusayla's Letter: "You possess the kind of freedom and kindness that we could only dream of. As for how you should live your life... that'll be up to you to decide."

Media:vo dhylq003 18 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So this box contains everything that Dehya's father left behind... Huh, it feels lighter than expected.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: That probably means this was really important to him.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh? There's something in the bottle!
Media:vo dhylq003 18 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Wait, what!?
Media:vo dhylq003 18 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Uh... sounds like he's serious.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: If you end up finding any leads, can you share them with us? We go on adventures all the time. Maybe we'll be able to find some information for you.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 sattar 01.ogg Sattar: Ah, here you are. Finally, I found you...
Media:vo dhylq003 18 sattar 02.ogg Sattar: Hah, what are you talking about? Do I look like I could take you all in a fight? I just came here to give you something. I'll be on my way to give myself up to the Corps after this.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 sattar 03.ogg Sattar: Once I woke up, I hurried to Dakan Al-Ahmar's camp, hoping to alert them to your presence.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 sattar 04.ogg Sattar: But when I got there, I found no one except the members who were still too injured to move.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 sattar 05.ogg Sattar: Yeah, they told me that they had exacted their revenge, and everyone had turned themselves in to the authorities. Even that last camp was not going to last for much longer.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 sattar 06.ogg Sattar: I had joined the cause to repay an old favor from Kusayla. Now that everyone's already turned themselves in, I might as well do the same.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 sattar 07.ogg Sattar: One of the injured members gave this box to me, and told me that it contained some of the old man's last possessions.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 sattar 08.ogg Sattar: Everything left in the camp will get confiscated, so I figured I should get this to you before the Corps could get their hands on it.
Media:vo dhylq003 18 sattar 09.ogg Sattar: No worries. We are all just living our own truths. There's no need to comment or judge anyone for it.
Media:vo dialog dhylq002 ayoub 01.ogg Ayyoub: I guess it all comes down to this...
Media:vo dialog dhylq002 mirza 01.ogg Mirza: Ugh, what a bummer. I just had to get injured now, right before the final fight...
Media:vo dialog dhylq002 mirza 02.ogg Mirza: Be sure to punch one of 'em for me.
