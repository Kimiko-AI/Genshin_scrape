 About the old ghost...
Affan: Only outsiders ask about the old ghost. The children of the village all know his name.
Affan: Whenever a child is naughty, their parents will say, "The old ghost will come take you away."
Affan: These younglings don't know the old ghost at all, but are pretty good at using his name to scare people.
Affan: I met the old ghost myself as a child. He did dislike children, but he wasn't scary.
Affan: For some reason, he became known as the old ghost. I thought it was just a bunch of people talking about him behind his back.
 Weren't you friends?
Affan: When I was young, I used to sneak close to his garden to play. He'd chase me away with a garden hoe as soon as he saw me.
Affan: He probably took me for a naughty child looking to cause trouble. Why would he remember me?
Affan: He might not have known who I was, but I still remember him and his little garden.
Affan: So I suppose I can call him my friend, right?
Affan: I want to grow the same flowers, just to recreate that little garden in my memories.
 As in, Sumeru Roses?
 Doesn't look like there's been any change.
 I can help.
 I haven't tried them yet.
 Quest DescriptionThe flowers planted by Affan haven't sprouted yet. Water them for him.
 Sure.
 They were delicious.
Affan: Delicious, eh? I'll make more for you, then.
 Weren't you friends?
 Why live here?
Affan: Well, anyway, I'm an old weirdo, and "old weirdos behave in inexplicable ways." Few people ask me questions like you do.
Affan: I've always wanted to go out and grab the chance to do something with my life.
Affan: When I was a newlywed, I almost left with the Eremites, but then I thought about it, and I couldn't just leave my wife to take up a life of wandering.
Affan: Later, I met a traveling merchant and wanted to follow suit and do some business, but that didn't work out because I didn't have enough Mora.
Affan: Much later, my wife passed and nothing held me back anymore, but by then, I'd gotten too old to leave.
Affan: I've dragged things out up till now and I've missed out on too much.
Affan: In retrospect, I've found that I belong neither to this village, nor to anywhere else.
Affan: So in the end, I moved by myself to the edge of the village, and I found life here to be more comfortable.
Affan: And decades went by, just like that.
Affan: (The dream he never got to fulfill when he was alive... Allow me to realize it for him.)
Affan: ...
Affan: After growing things for decades, I do know how to make some simple fertilizer.
Affan: Ah! Oh. I was lost in thought. I'm sorry, I'm old, and my mind has begun to wander. How embarrassing...
Affan: Alright, alright...
Affan: Alright, in that case, please water these three seeds first.
Affan: And I don't store much water for daily use either, so it is rather inconvenient to water the seeds in the nursery often.
Affan: And decades went by, just like that.
Affan: But this nursery is a little far from any water sources. It's not easy to bring water here.
Affan: Come, come, look at these seeds.
Affan: Delicious, eh? I'll make more for you, then.
Affan: For some reason, he became known as the old ghost. I thought it was just a bunch of people talking about him behind his back.
Affan: Good, good, you two are very resourceful.
Affan: Haha, didn't you children want to ask me what kind of flower this is?
Affan: He might not have known who I was, but I still remember him and his little garden.
Affan: He probably took me for a naughty child looking to cause trouble. Why would he remember me?
Affan: Hmm? You're still here?
Affan: Huh. Is that so...
Affan: I guess I might as well tell you. I'm planting roses.
Affan: I have a feeling that they will grow well this time, now that I have guidance from the experts.
Affan: I met the old ghost myself as a child. He did dislike children, but he wasn't scary.
Affan: I want to grow the same flowers, just to recreate that little garden in my memories.
Affan: I won't drive people away anymore. But be careful not to tread on the nursery.
Affan: I'd like to invite you to come and see these flowers when they bloom. It's probably going to be tomorrow or the day after. Will you be able to make it?
Affan: I'm not as good of a cook as my late wife, so forgive my poor cooking. Please take them. The portions are smaller this time, though.
Affan: I've always wanted to go out and grab the chance to do something with my life.
Affan: I've been growing crops for years, but growing flowers must be different.
Affan: I've dragged things out up till now and I've missed out on too much.
Affan: In retrospect, I've found that I belong neither to this village, nor to anywhere else.
Affan: Later, I met a traveling merchant and wanted to follow suit and do some business, but that didn't work out because I didn't have enough Mora.
Affan: Much later, my wife passed and nothing held me back anymore, but by then, I'd gotten too old to leave.
Affan: No matter. Just think of that fellow as an old man who used to grow some flowers...
Affan: Oh, I forgot. You're not from Aaru Village, so you're most likely not familiar with that name.
Affan: Only outsiders ask about the old ghost. The children of the village all know his name.
Affan: Remember how I told you that these flower seeds were left to me by a friend?
Affan: So I suppose I can call him my friend, right?
Affan: So in the end, I moved by myself to the edge of the village, and I found life here to be more comfortable.
Affan: Thank you again, children. You can have a look around if there's anything else you want to see.
Affan: That makes sense. Such rare flowers should be more delicate than normal ones. Indeed, I don't water and fertilize them enough.
Affan: These younglings don't know the old ghost at all, but are pretty good at using his name to scare people.
Affan: This type of flower is called the Golden Rose. It's much more precious than the Sumeru Rose.
Affan: Water these three seeds first, and I'll think about what to do about the fertilizer.
Affan: Well, anyway, I'm an old weirdo, and "old weirdos behave in inexplicable ways." Few people ask me questions like you do.
Affan: Well, these seeds, and this old house I'm living in now were all left to me by that late "old ghost."
Affan: Were the Shawarma and Tahchin good?
Affan: When I was a newlywed, I almost left with the Eremites, but then I thought about it, and I couldn't just leave my wife to take up a life of wandering.
Affan: When I was young, I used to sneak close to his garden to play. He'd chase me away with a garden hoe as soon as he saw me.
Affan: Whenever a child is naughty, their parents will say, "The old ghost will come take you away."
Affan: Why else haven't they grown after so long?
Affan: â™ªRose, oh rose, grant me my wish...
Paimon: Grandpa Affan, Paimon thinks your nursery is too dry. And there might not be enough nutrients in the soil around Aaru Village.
Paimon: Hey, Grandpa Affan, you're spacing out all of a sudden. Hello! Hello?
Paimon: Let Paimon see, hmm...
Paimon: This is so tasty! You're really kind! We'll visit you often.
Paimon: We've helped a villager grow flowers before, so we have experience.
