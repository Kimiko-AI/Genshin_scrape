 All right then.
 Are you a researcher?
 Correct.
 Dendro?
 I can understand that.
 No.
Sabbah: Huh? Did I guess wrong? Let me think again...
 Quest DescriptionThe Sumeru Roses planted by Sabbah never grow. Try to help her.
 Rose folk song?
 Roses sure are picky customers.
 So, what can we help you with?
 So, you're doing this for your research?
 Sure.
 Too bad there are no flowers yet.
 Well, this place is mostly sand, after all.
 What did you say?
 Why grow Sumeru Roses?
Sabbah: You probably don't know much about them... but they are very versatile, and have many uses.
Sabbah: They can be eaten, turned into medicine, given as gifts, or fetch a good price on the market.
Sabbah: And that's just some of the more common applications.
Sabbah: The flower, leaves, and stalk of a Sumeru Rose also did not always look like this. They all had different appearances once upon a time.
Sabbah: I believe geographical changes led to changes in the roses' traits.
Sabbah: A study of its traits could help us derive past geographical and historical information.
Sabbah: I won't be able to explain the mechanism over just a casual conversation, and sharing such information with adventurers is probably against the rules as well.
Sabbah: If you're interested in botanical evolution, you should visit the Akademiya. They'll have more on the subject.
 So, you're doing this for your research?
Sabbah: I'm not a researcher anymore. I no longer have the right or means to pursue any research.
Sabbah: If you must know why... *sigh*, you are a very curious soul, you know that?
Sabbah: I grew a lot of Sumeru Roses back in my former residence. The flowers were spectacular, and I got to see them every day.
Sabbah: If it was possible, I wish I could see them again, just like before.
Sabbah: ...That's all there is to it.
 I can understand that.
 Yes.
Sabbah: No wonder you've never heard of that folk song.
 You're not from here?
Sabbah: Are you surprised? Well, I guess that means that I've adapted pretty well.
Sabbah: When I first got here, I was unable to get used to anything, whether it be the food, the housing, or anything else.
Sabbah: But I got used to everything over time.
Sabbah: That doesn't mean that I've fully accepted my predicament, though.
Sabbah: I suppose it is impossible to make roses from Sumeru City bloom here after all.
 Are you a researcher?
Sabbah: I could have been called that once, but not anymore.
Sabbah: I said something beyond my station, and learned something I shouldn't have.
Sabbah: I broke the Akademiya's taboos, so I was removed from amongst their ranks.
 What did you say?
Sabbah: Curiosity is the impetus for seeking wisdom, but it's also the cause of sin.
Sabbah: I only understood that after I was exiled to this place.
Sabbah: For safety reasons, I don't think I should go into details.
 All right then.
Sabbah: Ahem, but...
Gradually, sprouts begin peeking out of the soil.
Paimon: Are you going to sing for us, Sabbah? Paimon's dying to hear the rest of it!
Paimon: Hmm. If it's just Dendro you want, this is pretty easy! We got this!
Paimon: Is this what you usually talk with people about, Miss Sabbah?
Paimon: It should be fine now, right, Miss Sabbah?
Paimon: Miss Sabbah really loves roses, huh? She hired us even though she knew that roses aren't suited to this place at all.
Paimon: Now we're talking! We're battle-hardened adventurers. We can do any job, no problem!
Paimon: Paimon got lost somewhere between "symbiotic relationship" and "the collective imagination," but don't worry, Paimon understood that last sentence!
Paimon: Paimon understands that feeling. It's like when you're already full but still feel the urge to eat when you see street food.
Paimon: Sure! So, that kid sang about the rose granting wishes...
Paimon: Technically, we're adventurers, the glorious world-trotting duo â€” Paimon and (Traveler)!
Paimon: That's a local Sumeru folk song called the "Singing Rose," right? It's such a cute song.
Paimon: They're sprouting! Paimon knew you could do just about anything, (Traveler)!
Paimon: Too bad the boy ran off halfway through. Paimon would have loved to hear the whole thing and say hi to him.
Paimon: Uh, hold on, Paimon can't keep up anymore...
Paimon: We do know a lot of scholars, but we aren't quite like them ourselves.
Paimon: What's so funny? We're super famous adventurers, believe it or not.
Paimon: Y'know what? They're actually the same obsession, just for different things! That's why we've gotta help her!
Paimon: You said that the land here isn't suitable for Sumeru Roses, right? We've also only seen them in places with moist soil.
Sabbah: ...Okay then, I'll wait for you.
Sabbah: ...That's all there is to it.
Sabbah: A study of its traits could help us derive past geographical and historical information.
Sabbah: Ah yes. Were you talking about the rose folk song that Ziyad was singing?
Sabbah: Ah! I'm sorry, I thought since you were new here, you'd prefer such topics over farming or the weather.
Sabbah: Ahem, but...
Sabbah: And that's just some of the more common applications.
Sabbah: Are you surprised? Well, I guess that means that I've adapted pretty well.
Sabbah: At the same time, plants are also a part of the symbiotic relationship between our ancestors and the flora and fauna of the desert.
Sabbah: Based on what I know about roses, they will grow if fertilized with highly concentrated Dendro, even if you grow them in sand.
Sabbah: But I got used to everything over time.
Sabbah: But I'm just a normal person without a Dendro Vision, and I lack the resources to obtain effective fertilizer.
Sabbah: But it's near-impossible to get such fertilizer out here, so I'm wondering if you may be able to get your hands on some...
Sabbah: Can you wield Dendro? Are you someone with a Vision?
Sabbah: Curiosity is the impetus for seeking wisdom, but it's also the cause of sin.
Sabbah: Do you really have a way to grow roses through the power of Dendro?
Sabbah: Do you think... at some point... you would be able to come by and fertilize my plants again?
Sabbah: For safety reasons, I don't think I should go into details.
Sabbah: Give the roses some more time to take in the nourishment. It will be better for them as well.
Sabbah: However... Aaru is built on sand and the soil here is actually not suitable for the cultivation of Sumeru Roses.
Sabbah: Huh? Did I guess wrong? Let me think again...
Sabbah: I believe geographical changes led to changes in the roses' traits.
Sabbah: I broke the Akademiya's taboos, so I was removed from amongst their ranks.
Sabbah: I could have been called that once, but not anymore.
Sabbah: I didn't expect to have another long conversation with you.
Sabbah: I grew a lot of Sumeru Roses back in my former residence. The flowers were spectacular, and I got to see them every day.
Sabbah: I haven't met anyone like that in a long time. What a nostalgic feeling...
Sabbah: I know it's ridiculous to want roses that don't belong here to bloom, but regardless, I still really want to see them.
Sabbah: I only understood that after I was exiled to this place.
Sabbah: I said something beyond my station, and learned something I shouldn't have.
Sabbah: I suppose it is impossible to make roses from Sumeru City bloom here after all.
Sabbah: I thought adventurers would just come and go, never coming back to chit-chat after finishing their jobs.
Sabbah: I won't be able to explain the mechanism over just a casual conversation, and sharing such information with adventurers is probably against the rules as well.
Sabbah: I'm embarrassed to even say it, but that is my wish.
Sabbah: I'm not a researcher anymore. I no longer have the right or means to pursue any research.
Sabbah: I'm sorry if I offended you. My name is Sabbah. I offer you my apologies as well as my welcome to the village.
Sabbah: I'm very grateful to you as it is. I wouldn't wish to bother you further.
Sabbah: If it was possible, I wish I could see them again, just like before.
Sabbah: If it weren't for you, I don't think I'd have ever seen these roses sprout.
Sabbah: If only I knew this would happen... instead of seeds, I should have brought a few more books.
Sabbah: If you must know why... *sigh*, you are a very curious soul, you know that?
Sabbah: If you're interested in botanical evolution, you should visit the Akademiya. They'll have more on the subject.
Sabbah: In a harsh environment like the desert, water is an extremely vital resource, so they prized water-storing plants.
Sabbah: It's my belief that the wish-granting flower in the song represents the collective imagination of our ancestors.
Sabbah: Just drop by and see them in your spare time. That would be enough.
Sabbah: No wonder you've never heard of that folk song.
Sabbah: No, I wasn't mocking you, friends from faraway. Just the opposite. It's a delight to hear uplifting stories like people traveling the world.
Sabbah: Oh, that's normal. You can't rush such things.
Sabbah: Plants have to go through stages of growth. That you were able to make them sprout is already quite amazing.
Sabbah: So, the more adverse the terrain, the more stories there are about plants. It's a reflection of our ancestors' yearning for a better life.
Sabbah: Sorry, I'm not good at singing... But we can discuss what the song is about.
Sabbah: Speaking of roses, I was thinking that since you two are adventurers, perhaps I can hire you to...
Sabbah: That doesn't mean that I've fully accepted my predicament, though.
Sabbah: That's right, they should sprout soon if powered by Dendro. Let's just wait for a while...
Sabbah: The Sumeru Roses I planted could never grow, so if you ask me, the Golden Rose in the song must have been a product of people's imagination...
Sabbah: The flower, leaves, and stalk of a Sumeru Rose also did not always look like this. They all had different appearances once upon a time.
Sabbah: The results were immediate, as I thought... Thank you.
Sabbah: They can be eaten, turned into medicine, given as gifts, or fetch a good price on the market.
Sabbah: To be honest, I don't have a lot of friends to talk to here.
Sabbah: We can talk more about it if you're interested. I hope it will liven up your journey.
Sabbah: Well then, are you scholars looking to study abroad in Sumeru? I know that there are many foreign scholars in the Akademiya.
Sabbah: When I first got here, I was unable to get used to anything, whether it be the food, the housing, or anything else.
Sabbah: When you're as detached from the world as I am, such enthusiastic remarks can really catch you off guard.
Sabbah: World-trotting? Hahaha!
Sabbah: Yes, Dendro promotes plant growth and works especially well on poor crops.
Sabbah: Yes. In a tiny village like ours, we don't have a big athenaeum like they do at the Akademiya. All our songs are passed down orally.
Sabbah: You must be new here. First time in Aaru Village?
Sabbah: You probably don't know much about them... but they are very versatile, and have many uses.
They stop growing after sprouting a few leaves.
Ziyad: â™ªBlooming from a stone, the Golden Rose sang to me.
Ziyad: â™ªRose, oh rose, grant me my wish.
Ziyad: â™ªShe sang...
