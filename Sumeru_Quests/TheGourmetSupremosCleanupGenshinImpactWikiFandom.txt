 A letter for me?
 It might tell us what happened.
 Quest DescriptionMaryam from Gilded Journey appears to want a word with you...
 Where is he now?
 Why did he leave a letter for me?
 Why don't we read the letter first?
Maryam: Beats me. All I know is that he dropped by in a hurry the other day and left this letter.
Maryam: He wanted me to make sure to give it to you. He even offered to pay.
Maryam: Traveler, please wait. Here's a letter for you.
Maryam: Yeah, Xudong left it for you. You know, the guy from Liyue.
Paimon: Did that bad guy cause trouble again?
Paimon: Okay... Let's see what he wrote.
