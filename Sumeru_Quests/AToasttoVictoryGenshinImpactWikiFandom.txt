 "The Six Great Sages"... sounds pretty powerful.

 About Fontaine, the next stop on my journey...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04d 1.ogg Nahida: Is that where you're headed next? Fontaine, the nation of justice.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04d 2.ogg Nahida: As far as I know, that nation operates on a judicial system.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03d 1.ogg Paimon: Does their archon personally judge people?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04d 3.ogg Nahida: No, there's a Chief Justice in Fontaine. Generally speaking, the Hydro Archon, Focalors, won't preside over individual trials.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04d 4.ogg Nahida: However... even then, Focalors will still make herself present at just about every trial. It seems that she just likes to immerse herself in that sort of atmosphere.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04d 5.ogg Nahida: As archon, she still reserves the right to influence the final verdict.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04d 6.ogg Nahida: Anyway, let's just say she's got... hmm... a very unique personality.

 About The Balladeer...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04c 1.ogg Nahida: He's still in a coma. I've hidden him like how one would hide a feather.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04c 2.ogg Nahida: I know you have many misgivings about him, but as someone who had "become a god," he has retained a number of very useful features.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04c 3.ogg Nahida: Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn't do any evil.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04c 4.ogg Nahida: In addition, there are still some mysteries left in him. Some things may be very clear from my perspective, but he has still yet to understand them himself.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04c 5.ogg Nahida: His future will be determined by fate.

 About my (sister/brother)...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 8.ogg Nahida: According to the records I was able to access, your sibling suddenly appeared in Khaenri'ah...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 9a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 9b.ogg Nahida: After the Khaenri'ah disaster, (she/he) began (her/his) journey through the seven nations of Teyvat.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 10a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 10b.ogg Nahida: But just as (her/his) journey was about to reach its conclusion, the Irminsul records on (her/him) suddenly become fuzzy...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 5a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 5b.ogg Paimon: What do you mean, "fuzzy"? Did something happen to (her/him)?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 12a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 12b.ogg Nahida: All I know for sure is that somebody, for reasons only they can know, is deliberately obfuscating (her/his) fate...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 13.ogg Nahida: And whoever it is... if they can do that, who knows what else they're capable of.
 Could it be related to... the Abyss?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 6a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 6b.ogg Paimon: But even that wouldn't explain how (she/he) somehow comes from this world...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 14.ogg Nahida: Something else I noticed was that according to these records, the Fatui have not classified your sibling as one of the "Descenders."
 Descenders?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 7.ogg Paimon: ...What's a Descender? Paimon's never heard of it...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 15.ogg Nahida: Look, I'm sure you must be curious about the information I received from the Fatui in return for my Gnosis, right?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 16.ogg Nahida: A very important part of the intel was about this world's Descenders... external beings, ones that don't belong to this world.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 17.ogg Nahida: (Traveler), you are Teyvat's "Fourth Descender."
 Fourth...?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 8a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 8b.ogg Paimon: Huh!? So the Fatui count three other Descenders before (Traveler)? And (his sister/her brother) isn't even one of them?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 18.ogg Nahida: That's right. My current hypothesis is that the "First Descender" was likely what we now call the Heavenly Principles.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 19.ogg Nahida: As for the other Descenders... I still need to verify their existence. It could take me some time.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 9.ogg Paimon: Whew... Paimon's head's about to burst from all this crazy new information...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 20.ogg Nahida: And yet, even knowing all this, I'm sure you must still have a lot of unanswered questions. I must say, I truly regret that I can't help you more as the God of Wisdom...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 21.ogg Nahida: There are many questions in my heart as well. I will need some time to go through each one of them.
 Same here... I'll need some time to reflect on what you've said.

 About the Akasha...
(Same as before)
 About the Akasha...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 1.ogg Nahida: After recent events, the Akasha can no longer function as it used to.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 2.ogg Nahida: I've given it some thought, and have decided to shut it down permanently.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 3.ogg Nahida: But this is definitely not a bad thing. Even from the beginning, I've been planning to shut it down.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 4.ogg Nahida: The Akasha's centralized administration of knowledge has always restrained people's curiosity and curtailed the number of paths available to them. I don't think this is good for Sumeru.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 5.ogg Nahida: Although people may initially feel a little uncomfortable with the loss of the Akasha, they will soon understand that this life is more suitable for them.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 6.ogg Nahida: And as for the future of Sumeru... I'm preparing to regain control of the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 7.ogg Nahida: The former sages have received their punishment, but the new sages have yet to be selected. I will oversee the process personally.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 8.ogg Nahida: I hope that the new Six Great Sages will be more focused on academics. Sumeru needs such leaders more than ever.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 9.ogg Nahida: The other big issue is the people of King Deshret — all the residents of the desert, in fact. They have been mistreated for far too long.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 10.ogg Nahida: I've already taken some measures to address this. It will take some time to rebuild everything, but no matter if it's culture, friendship, or trust... we will rebuild it.

 About what happened after I fell asleep that day...
(Same as before)
 About what happened after I fell asleep that day...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 1.ogg Nahida: You mean, what happened after The Doctor put you to sleep?
 Did he take the Gnoses?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 2.ogg Nahida: You guessed correctly... The top-ranked Fatui Harbingers, up to No. 3, possess power comparable to that of gods. I was no match for him in that kind of situation.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 3.ogg Nahida: However, in spite of the bad situation, I still managed to make a fair deal with The Doctor.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 4.ogg Nahida: I'm sure you remember the entity that changed your fate — the Heavenly Principles.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 5.ogg Nahida: In fact, the Heavenly Principles has been quiet since the Khaenri'ah disaster five hundred years ago. I used this point as leverage against The Doctor.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 6.ogg Nahida: I told him that the Heavenly Principles may be awakened if I destroyed a Gnosis. Although it was just a bluff, he still fell for it.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 7.ogg Nahida: I assumed that the Heavenly Principles wouldn't just stand by and let such extensive damage to its "laws" take place.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 8.ogg Nahida: And as for what I exchanged for the Gnoses...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 9.ogg Nahida: The exchange served as both punishment for The Doctor, as well as a boon of new knowledge that I couldn't refuse as the God of Wisdom.

 But you're amazing too, Collei.
 But... we both came from beyond the sea of stars.
 Could it be related to... the Abyss?
 Descenders?
 Did he take the Gnoses?
 Didn't expect to see you here.
 Do you have any further intel?
 Do you know what (she/he) has been through?
 Do you know where everybody is?
 Don't mention it.
 Don't mind me, my... my mind was elsewhere.
 Feels like I'm about to nod off...
 Fourth...?
 Good evening.
 Good morning, Collei.
 Great.
 He didn't seem to believe a word you told him.
 He's already talking with someone else.
 How have you been doing lately?
 How's Haypasia?
 How's your wound, Tighnari?
 Huh. I thought you might find it boring.
 I appreciate that's a lot to ask.
 I guess Nilou's only planning on telling him once festivities are underway.
 I guess being free is just a part of how Dehya operates.
 I think... I slept alright.
 I'm suddenly a little sleepy...
 I've fully recovered now.
 I've got nothing else to say.
(Continue to next section)
 I've got nothing else to say.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 22.ogg Nahida: And soon, you'll also begin your journey anew, and depart from Sumeru.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 23.ogg Nahida: I'm very interested in your future. It's a journey that can't be observed or recorded by this world...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 24.ogg Nahida: If fate is the ultimate knowledge, then your future will be the ultimate fate.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 10.ogg Paimon: Paimon's sure glad we got to meet you, Nahida.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 25.ogg Nahida: The pleasure is all mine... I can't thank you enough.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 26.ogg Nahida: All right, that's enough talk for today. If you ever miss me, just close your eyes — and maybe I'll appear in your dreams~
 Is your master all right?
 It must be rare to see you at such a lively gathering.
 It's alright, don't worry about us.
 It's been a while.
 It's great, thanks for inviting me.
 It's really not that amazing.
Media:vo xmaq305 2 collei 06a 1.ogg Collei: Everyone's aware of your abilities, there's no need to be modest.
 Let's see how this plays out. We're not in a rush, anyway...
 My pleasure, I'm glad we could come.
 No, not at all.
 Of course, you're right.
 Oh? So you really didn't know?
 Okay, we'll go around and check.
 Paimon has a point!
 Paimon hasn't already read it?
 Quest DescriptionThe operation to save Lesser Lord Kusanali has concluded. Despite the many surreal experiences that ensued, you feel surprisingly calm after waking up again in bed, facing the rising sun.
 Really?
 Return to the Akademiya? Abandoned and neglected...?
 Same here... I'll need some time to reflect on what you've said.
 So you're still a leader now, even if it's just temporary.
 Step DescriptionAlthough the dust has settled, you've still got some questions. Nahida, who is in the Sanctuary of Surasthana, will answer them for you.
 Step DescriptionNilou asked you to visit the invited guests throughout Sumeru and make sure that they can show up at the celebration feast on time...
 Step DescriptionThe feast has been held successfully, and everyone arrives on time to celebrate it with companions who fought side by side. Meanwhile, a mysterious guest is about to show up.
 Step DescriptionThe feast is held successfully and everyone arrives on time...
 Step DescriptionThe operation to save Lesser Lord Kusanali has concluded. Despite the many surreal experiences that ensued, you feel surprisingly calm after waking up again in bed, facing the rising sun. After breakfast, you take Nilou's letter and set out for the Grand Bazaar to meet her.
 Still nothing compared to Paimon.
 Thank you for taking us to him.
 Thanks for looking after us.
 Thanks for your hard work these days.
 Thanks, Dehya.
 That's one more talent under our belt.
 There shouldn't be any information on (her/him) in Irminsul.
 We didn't hear anything about that.
 We have a message to tell you.
 We were just doing our part.
Media:vo xmaq305 2 collei 06b 1.ogg Collei: Sometimes I'm really envious of strong and confident people like you.
 But you're amazing too, Collei.
Media:vo xmaq305 2 collei 06b 2.ogg Collei: Oh, you're embarrassing me... Hehe.
 We'll be sure to give the message to Nilou.
 We're good. How about you?
 Yeah, we heard.
 You two are invited as well!
 You're not going to be a scholar anymore?
(Traveler): (Ah, so that's what this is about... Nahida, it'd be better if you could do that yourself.)
(Traveler): (As the witness of all that happened, I shall respect her choice and keep the secret for her.)
(Traveler): (Have you made up your mind?)
(Traveler): (How is that possible? We journeyed the sea of stars all our lives until we came here. How could (she/he) possibly hail from Teyvat...?)
(Traveler): (Huh? It seems like someone is there...)
(Everyone desaturates and gets frozen in time except for the Traveler)
(Traveler): (Is it because I didn't sleep well last night that I feel sleepy all of a sudden? Or is it because I'm too full...?)
(Traveler): (Is there anything you need from me?)
(Traveler): (It seems that after everyone forgot Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, their understanding of Sumeru's history also changed...)
(Traveler): (It'll be fine. Please don't worry too much!)
(Traveler): (Maybe I'm the only one in all of Teyvat who remembers that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata ever existed.)
(Traveler): (Nahida, it looks like my consciousness is connected to yours again.)
(Traveler): (Now everyone believes that Lesser Lord Kusanali has been Sumeru's archon all along.)
(Traveler): (See? Just like I said, everybody is very happy to meet you.)
(Traveler): (Some things in this world must be done by yourself.)
(Traveler): (That's good... Wait? Huh!?)
(Traveler): (Then at least promise me you won't say anything weird when you're in my body!)
(Nahida, as the Traveler, walks up to the party)
(Traveler): (Things don't add up. Is there something wrong with my memories? Or is it this world that has done something to (her/him)...)
(Traveler): (What is it?)
A warm atmosphere of talking and laughter carries on late into the night...
And the feast ends on a perfect note.
Everybody eats and drinks before enjoying the performance prepared by Nilou and everyone in the Grand Bazaar...
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: The House of Daena is the last quiet place in the whole Akademiya now. I was originally planning to stay here a little longer...
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: But there's a chance that Kaveh might show up again... Tch, what a nuisance. I'd better go somewhere else.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: Whoa, whoa, whoa, Azar's downfall is of his own making. What does it have to do with me?
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: Really? Then I'm sure you can use your abilities to uncover the truth for yourself.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: You were out there all this time and yet you still haven't managed to learn a single crucial bit of information. Heh, I'm impressed.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: Fine. Apart from the leaders of Amurta and Vahumana, all the sages have been exposed and removed as Azar's accomplices. We need to select new sages for your Kshahrewar Darshan as well as my Haravatat Darshan.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: Oh, I think that's just a coincidence. Besides, whatever you were doing won't have any significant impact now or in times to come.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: Be my guest, but I think everybody will be more interested in your own well-known gaffes.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 candace 01.ogg Candace: (Traveler), it's good to see you again. Cyno said you were resting in Gandharva Ville for some time. How are you feeling now?
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 candace 02.ogg Candace: Good to hear. I'm happy that you've returned safe and sound.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 candace 03.ogg Candace: Thanks for all that you've done. The villagers won't be exaggerating when they say, "Heroes once passed through our village."
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 candace 04.ogg Candace: If you ever have time, please come visit Aaru Village again. I still want to go hunting with you.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 collei 01.ogg Collei: Everything has been getting better lately, and my mood has been improving as well.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 collei 02.ogg Collei: You can come find me anytime if you need anything.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 collei 03.ogg Collei: You're welcome, I was just doing my duty. Remember to talk to Master Tighnari before you leave.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Indeed. Take it one step at a time. There is still a long journey before you.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Yeah, you need to be stronger than an ox to take life by the horns.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Is there any place you'd like to go? I can accompany you, I've got time.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Fine by me!
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: If we go to the desert, I can introduce you to my friends there. But we should prepare and get everything we need before setting off.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: You can count me in!
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: After recovering from Eleazar, everything seems so different to me. When I look at the scenery I've visited before, it has a completely different feeling.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: I think I've heard you say something like that before, but today, I finally understand what you mean!
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: Hmm... What if I tell you I want to go to the desert?
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: Let's go! I'll go pack my luggage now. After we're done with the feast in two days, we can go have fun in the desert!
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 hushang 01.ogg Hushang: I'll go to the Adventurers' Guild later and ask Miss Katheryne if she knows how to get one of those Kameras.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 hushang 02.ogg Hushang: And Nilou will become even more famous, haha! It won't be long till people are fighting for front row at your performances.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 hushang 03.ogg Hushang: No, no, I think we look absolutely fine! If anything, when we pose for this... uh, clever invention, we should just be ourselves, hm?
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 kaveh 01.ogg Kaveh: Azar has gone to the Avidya Forest to reflect on himself for the rest of his life, and those people say they want you to replace him as the Grand Sage? What have you done!?
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 kaveh 02.ogg Kaveh: Everyone out there is saying something different. Some say Azar wanted to create a god, while others say he wanted to sell his power...
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 kaveh 03.ogg Kaveh: Heh, but none of these sound very likely. If you ask me, I think the people spreading rumors around here don't have access to any real information.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 kaveh 04.ogg Kaveh: ...
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: Can't you show just a little respect to your senior and explain what's going on!?
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: What? Did my Darshan collude with Azar as well? Wait... could this be why they sent me out on a project?
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: You... Hmph! Listen here, I'm not buying any of it. Don't try to use this as an opportunity to talk about your crazy theories.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: I think there are a few details that everyone is overlooking... For example, how as the Scribe, you were somehow able to escape this political crisis completely unscathed...
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: This can easily be seen as the results of a power struggle, no? Yet nobody has stopped to point that out yet... I almost feel like I should go out and start telling people about that!
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: Do you know what? I am done with you!
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: I think it's an amazing idea! Who knows, if we take more pictures, they might even become the signature souvenir of the Grand Bazaar.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: Ah, should we get ready then? Perhaps we should wear something a little more appropriate...
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 rahman 01.ogg Rahman: Anyway, our preparation has been going smoothly these days. Can such good things really be happening in the desert? It's almost hard to believe...
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 rahman 02.ogg Rahman: Haha, what heartwarming words.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 setare 01.ogg Setaria: Yes, even if you can't bring yourself to believe it, you should at least believe in those of us who are working hard to make it a reality.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 sheikhzubayr 01.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: Yes, please do. I'm sure the audience would be thrilled at the chance of receiving commemorative gifts.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 sheikhzubayr 02.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: It could be our special surprise that we prepare for everyone.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 sheikhzubayr 03.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: I've heard that this Kamera is not just something anyone can use as they please. It must be aimed properly and subjects should pose for the best results.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 sheikhzubayr 04.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: You really think so...?
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Is there anything else you'd like to ask about?
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: Ah yes, thanks for remembering her. She continued her training in the forest after she recovered. As a scholar, she never slacks off.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: A lot has happened lately. Collei and I have been busy, but don't worry, we'll take care of ourselves.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: As for Cyno's reinstatement, the more I think about it, the more I suspect that he just doesn't have a single clue about this feast.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: But this does remind me that Collei and I should find an opportunity to celebrate him as well. He has helped me a lot during this time.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: And you as well, thank you.
Media:vo dialog xmaq305 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: Take care. Please find me if you need anything.
Media:vo xmaq305 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Today's the big day! Let's go to the Grand Bazaar and see how the celebration's coming along.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: I propose that the last one who arrived be put in charge of today's speeches.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: Oh really? Well, even better.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: We owe it to our abilities... and luck.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: It's luck that brought us together and it was luck that let us form a team. Then it took even more luck for us to formulate a plan and implement it successfully.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: Moreover, judging from the results, everything worked out well.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: No, everything you said is correct.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: You could simply tell Lesser Lord Kusanali that you wish to have Azar and his accomplices severely punished.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: Are you trying to say that I'm fit to be a sage?
Media:vo xmaq305 11 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: *ahem* Could you try to put it another way? This is a good thing, yet you're making it sound like I overthrew Azar for my own personal gain.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 alhaitham 10.ogg Alhaitham: I did have my own motive, but it had nothing to do with being a sage.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 alhaitham 11.ogg Alhaitham: If the rules of our nation were suddenly cast by the wayside, then it wouldn't be long until chaos ensued. I had no intention of letting their dreams disrupt my life.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 alhaitham 12.ogg Alhaitham: Precisely.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 alhaitham 13.ogg Alhaitham: It's reason enough.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 alhaitham 14.ogg Alhaitham: You flatter me.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: You're here.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: Everything looks quite good.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: Don't mention it.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: That's how I remember it, too.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Something wrong?
Media:vo xmaq305 11 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: Perhaps I shouldn't say this, but their treatment of Lesser Lord Kusanali calls for a more severe punishment.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: ...I respect our deity's decision, and won't interfere in any way.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: While we're on this topic, why didn't you accept the Akademiya's invitation to become the Grand Sage?
Media:vo xmaq305 11 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: Heh, not at all, but every person handling the selection process has said that you are the most suitable candidate to lead the Akademiya right now.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: That's right.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: ...It's not about being happy. There are merely a lot of things that I must do.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo xmaq305 11 cyno 13.ogg Cyno: Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Well, look who finally decided to show up.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Nah, there won't be any speeches today.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Feels kinda nice to be seen as a hero. I could get used to this.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: Haha, my lady sure has a way with words. Thanks, I'm glad to hear it!
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: Really? Why do I remember everybody thinking that luck was against us and feeling like we hardly had a chance of succeeding?
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: *ahem* Even if those two giants of the Akademiya are here, I still have to say it...
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: Those sages really have some nerve. Five hundred years ago, Lesser Lord Kusanali used all her power for the people of Sumeru, and what did they do in return?
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: If you bite the hand that feeds you, then don't act surprised when it turns into a knuckle sandwich, right, Cyno?
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: Why? Because he dethroned Azar from power?
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: But seriously though, I always wondered if you had some personal motives behind it.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dehya 11.ogg Dehya: By that, you mean your life working as the Akademiya's Scribe?
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dehya 12.ogg Dehya: Alright then, how about you? You've already resumed work as the General Mahamatra, right?
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: You look like you came here immediately after finishing up some work. I'm very happy to see you here!
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: Being a bodyguard is also a hero's job! You've always been amazing, Dehya.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: And I'm happy to meet everyone that participated in the great plan.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: Yes! Even after being abandoned and neglected so many times, she has finally returned.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dunyarzad 05.ogg Dunyarzad: Mm-hmm, Lesser Lord Kusanali once used all her power in a great disaster, which resulted in her losing all of her wisdom and memories of the past. The Akademiya basically abandoned her because of it.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dunyarzad 06.ogg Dunyarzad: This should be something everybody should remember... Huh, you look surprised... I didn't say anything wrong, did I?
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dunyarzad 07.ogg Dunyarzad: Whew, that's good.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 dunyarzad 08.ogg Dunyarzad: You've certainly got quite the personality...
Media:vo xmaq305 11 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Ah, there you are!
Media:vo xmaq305 11 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: Come join us over here! Let's share some great food and drinks, and chat about all sorts of fun things.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: The food was specially prepared for you by everyone in the Grand Bazaar, and we have gifts that were sent by the residents of Sumeru City when they heard we were holding a feast.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 nilou 04.ogg Nilou: Everyone that came said that you saved Sumeru, and wanted me to thank you all on their behalf.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 nilou 05.ogg Nilou: Yeah, everyone gave it their all when it mattered most.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 nilou 06.ogg Nilou: It was almost like a performance. We took the stage and put on our best show.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 nilou 07.ogg Nilou: Everyone played their part, and thanks to everyone's efforts, the performance was a great success.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 nilou 08.ogg Nilou: It's such a blessing that Lesser Lord Kusanali was able to return to power at the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 nilou 09.ogg Nilou: Huh? Wait, is that all?
Media:vo xmaq305 11 nilou 10.ogg Nilou: Will you be happy with that life?
Media:vo xmaq305 11 nilou 11.ogg Nilou: Even so, keep your spirits up and try to be happy, okay? And try to smile more every day, just like I'm doing now.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Everybody's already here. Looks like we're the last ones to arrive.
Media:vo xmaq305 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: But we're not late, are we? It's just that everyone else arrived ahead of time!
Media:vo xmaq305 11 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wow... Paimon can't wait! (Traveler), just look at all the delicious food here!
Media:vo xmaq305 11 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Whoa~! It's so delicious! Oh~! This grilled meat tastes amazing!
Media:vo xmaq305 11 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Come to think of it, we've really done something impressive together... It's unbelievable!
Media:vo xmaq305 11 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: So would you say we're good actors too?
Media:vo xmaq305 11 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Yeah (Traveler), what's with that face? You knew all of this already!
Media:vo xmaq305 11 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: So that's the only reason why you joined us and came up with all those plans?
Media:vo xmaq305 12 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: I seldom participate in such lively gatherings, but the atmosphere here is quite good.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: No, this gathering today has a unique meaning.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: The Grand Bazaar is lively because the people here feel happiness from the bottom of their hearts, unlike the farces at the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: That happiness is an emotion that'll be forever alien to those bookworms who have driven themselves insane by studying.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: ...Hm, I seem to have taken both keys when I left the house.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: Heh, oh well.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: The atmosphere here is good, and everything is delicious.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: Yeah.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: I don't often come to such places, but it feels quite good.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: I have a lot to handle these days. Otherwise, I could show you around.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: There's always next time. We're friends, after all.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: ...This feast is pretty good. I like it.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: My lady, the grilled meat over there is delicious. Have you tried it?
Media:vo xmaq305 12 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: You said it. Oh, look who else is here.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Hey, less of that polite chit-chat and more eating and drinking. The feast is about having fun, not stuffy formalities!
Media:vo xmaq305 12 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: Yes! I also tried some fruits just now. They're very sweet.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: What an amazing place to relax. No wonder everybody likes to rest at the Grand Bazaar.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: Hello, I'm so happy Nilou invited everybody. Now I have a chance to meet all the heroes.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Ah, there you are, (Traveler)!
Media:vo xmaq305 12 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: Well, how is it? Are you enjoying the feast today? If there's anything you're unhappy with, just let me know. I'll be sure to take note of it.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: Hehe... That's good.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 nilou 04.ogg Nilou: It's the first time I've ever invited so many exceptional people to one place. I was a little nervous myself.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 nilou 05.ogg Nilou: You see, every guest here is quite extraordinary. It's unbelievable that we got everyone to gather here... almost like a fairy tale.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 nilou 06.ogg Nilou: Make sure you live it up tonight! I'll be happy as long as you're enjoying yourselves.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 nilou 07.ogg Nilou: I'm honored to have her think of me this way. If I have a chance in the future, I would really like to invite her to one of my performances.
Media:vo xmaq305 12 nilou 08.ogg Nilou: I can't explain why, but I just feel elated right now! Thank you, (Traveler)!
Media:vo xmaq305 13 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: I didn't expect to have a conversation with the consciousness of Lesser Lord Kusanali in the Grand Bazaar. Interesting. Is this also a part of the feast?
Media:vo xmaq305 13 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: This is how the relationship between the Akademiya and Dendro Archon should be. We just did what was necessary and set things back on the right path.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: You don't need to be so ceremonious... It's always been my duty to protect you.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Hold up! What's going on, (Traveler)?
Media:vo xmaq305 13 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: You're an archon, but you act so humble. You really don't need to be so polite with us.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: Lesser... Lord Kusanali...?
(Dunyarzad blinks, and Nahida appears to take on her own form)
Media:vo xmaq305 13 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: Lesser Lord Kusanali, y—you've done so much for Sumeru, and I... I didn't even have a chance to do anything for you... You don't have to do this.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: Hehe, it's me.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: Mhm. You may blame me for being a bit too self-indulgent. I was thinking about talking with you, and the next thing I knew, I had made a connection with you.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 03.ogg Nahida: The connection between us is amazing! It's like flora and the fence it grows upon.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: I heard there's an amazing celebration feast today at the Grand Bazaar. I wanted to have a look for myself, so I snuck in.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 05.ogg Nahida: Lately, I've been so busy dealing with all the fallout from recent events, so I really haven't had any free time...
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 06.ogg Nahida: (Traveler), although you've already helped me with a lot, there's still one more thing I hope you can help me with.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 07.ogg Nahida: Please say thank you to everyone for me.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 08.ogg Nahida: Oh... Is it not convenient for you to do that for me?
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 09.ogg Nahida: But, if I just show up all of a sudden... people will become all quiet and stiff, won't they?
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 10.ogg Nahida: What if I end up scaring them and ruining this wonderful feast... That'd be the last thing I want.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 11.ogg Nahida: Hmm... Let me think about it...
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 12.ogg Nahida: ...Okay!
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 13.ogg Nahida: Yes, I have.
(Nahida reaches out and enters the Traveler's body)
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 14.ogg Nahida: You said I should go thank everyone as myself, right? So...
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 15.ogg Nahida: I've decided to borrow your body for the time being. Please don't blame me. The flora also climbs up the fence to get closer to the sky.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 16.ogg Nahida: Everyone.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 17.ogg Nahida: It's me.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 18.ogg Nahida: Hello, Nilou.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 19.ogg Nahida: Yes, I already know every one of you. Nilou, Alhaitham, Cyno, Dehya, Paimon, and Dunyarzad.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 20.ogg Nahida: I took the liberty of occupying (Traveler)'s body so that I could thank all of you in person.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 21.ogg Nahida: Thank you so much for rescuing me, even if that meant placing your own safety in peril, and taking the risk of becoming enemies with the Akademiya, the Sages, The Doctor, The Balladeer, and even the entirety of Sumeru.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 22.ogg Nahida: Without you, without any of you... I would have been in a much more difficult situation.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 23.ogg Nahida: Had you not helped me to resolve the crisis, not only I, but Sumeru and even the entirety of Teyvat, would've suffered great misfortune.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 24.ogg Nahida: People refer to you as "the heroes who managed to rescue a god." I am quite fond of this name. It not only explains your identities, but also bears witness to your relationship with me.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 25.ogg Nahida: Please allow me to present to you my most sincere gratitude.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 26.ogg Nahida: Dunyarzad, the suffering you endured during your illness is also proof of you being with me and praying for me. Thank you.
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 27.ogg Nahida: ...Thank you, all of you. Thank you so much.
(Nahida's appearance transitions back to the Traveler)
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nahida 28.ogg Nahida: ...Yeah!
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: No, no, of course not! Are you... Lesser Lord Kusanali?
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: You know who I am!?
Media:vo xmaq305 13 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: I... I'm honored to have been able to take part in this plan! I hope you liked the dance I dedicated to you!
Media:vo xmaq305 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, what's wrong? Your head is starting to droop...
Media:vo xmaq305 13 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hey, you can't just fall asleep here! Paimon will go find something delicious for you to eat. You'll wake up once you've put something yummy in your tummy!
Media:vo xmaq305 13 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Of course. Just wait here for Paimon!
(Paimon leaves the Traveler)
Media:vo xmaq305 13 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Are you awake now? Paimon was just about to bring you the food!
Media:vo xmaq305 13 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh, that voice... Nahida!?
Media:vo xmaq305 14 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Are you awake? Did you rest well?
Media:vo xmaq305 14 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: After Nahida left, you ate a lot of food. You've become a glutton!
Media:vo xmaq305 14 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmph. That just means you still have a lot to learn from Master Paimon, the Sage of Gluttony!
Media:vo xmaq305 14 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: All right. Since you're awake now, should we go and have a chat with Nahida?
Media:vo xmaq305 14 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: She should be in the Akademiya right about now. If you have any questions, now's your chance to ask.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: Hello, Traveler and Paimon.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: What a fantastic night. I'm still immersed in all the happiness and joy, like a candle floating on water.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 03.ogg Nahida: Is there anything you want to know?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 1.ogg Nahida: After recent events, the Akasha can no longer function as it used to.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 10.ogg Nahida: I've already taken some measures to address this. It will take some time to rebuild everything, but no matter if it's culture, friendship, or trust... we will rebuild it.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 2.ogg Nahida: I've given it some thought, and have decided to shut it down permanently.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 3.ogg Nahida: But this is definitely not a bad thing. Even from the beginning, I've been planning to shut it down.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 4.ogg Nahida: The Akasha's centralized administration of knowledge has always restrained people's curiosity and curtailed the number of paths available to them. I don't think this is good for Sumeru.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 5.ogg Nahida: Although people may initially feel a little uncomfortable with the loss of the Akasha, they will soon understand that this life is more suitable for them.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 6.ogg Nahida: And as for the future of Sumeru... I'm preparing to regain control of the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 7.ogg Nahida: The former sages have received their punishment, but the new sages have yet to be selected. I will oversee the process personally.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 8.ogg Nahida: I hope that the new Six Great Sages will be more focused on academics. Sumeru needs such leaders more than ever.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04a 9.ogg Nahida: The other big issue is the people of King Deshret — all the residents of the desert, in fact. They have been mistreated for far too long.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 1.ogg Nahida: You mean, what happened after The Doctor put you to sleep?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 2.ogg Nahida: You guessed correctly... The top-ranked Fatui Harbingers, up to No. 3, possess power comparable to that of gods. I was no match for him in that kind of situation.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 3.ogg Nahida: However, in spite of the bad situation, I still managed to make a fair deal with The Doctor.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 4.ogg Nahida: I'm sure you remember the entity that changed your fate — the Heavenly Principles.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 5.ogg Nahida: In fact, the Heavenly Principles has been quiet since the Khaenri'ah disaster five hundred years ago. I used this point as leverage against The Doctor.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 6.ogg Nahida: I told him that the Heavenly Principles may be awakened if I destroyed a Gnosis. Although it was just a bluff, he still fell for it.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 7.ogg Nahida: I assumed that the Heavenly Principles wouldn't just stand by and let such extensive damage to its "laws" take place.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 8.ogg Nahida: And as for what I exchanged for the Gnoses...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04b 9.ogg Nahida: The exchange served as both punishment for The Doctor, as well as a boon of new knowledge that I couldn't refuse as the God of Wisdom.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04c 1.ogg Nahida: He's still in a coma. I've hidden him like how one would hide a feather.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04c 2.ogg Nahida: I know you have many misgivings about him, but as someone who had "become a god," he has retained a number of very useful features.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04c 3.ogg Nahida: Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn't do any evil.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04c 4.ogg Nahida: In addition, there are still some mysteries left in him. Some things may be very clear from my perspective, but he has still yet to understand them himself.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04c 5.ogg Nahida: His future will be determined by fate.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04d 1.ogg Nahida: Is that where you're headed next? Fontaine, the nation of justice.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04d 2.ogg Nahida: As far as I know, that nation operates on a judicial system.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04d 3.ogg Nahida: No, there's a Chief Justice in Fontaine. Generally speaking, the Hydro Archon, Focalors, won't preside over individual trials.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04d 4.ogg Nahida: However... even then, Focalors will still make herself present at just about every trial. It seems that she just likes to immerse herself in that sort of atmosphere.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04d 5.ogg Nahida: As archon, she still reserves the right to influence the final verdict.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04d 6.ogg Nahida: Anyway, let's just say she's got... hmm... a very unique personality.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 1.ogg Nahida: Are you sure? Isn't there something else that you haven't asked about yet?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 10a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 10b.ogg Nahida: But just as (her/his) journey was about to reach its conclusion, the Irminsul records on (her/him) suddenly become fuzzy...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 12a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 12b.ogg Nahida: All I know for sure is that somebody, for reasons only they can know, is deliberately obfuscating (her/his) fate...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 13.ogg Nahida: And whoever it is... if they can do that, who knows what else they're capable of.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 14.ogg Nahida: Something else I noticed was that according to these records, the Fatui have not classified your sibling as one of the "Descenders."
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 15.ogg Nahida: Look, I'm sure you must be curious about the information I received from the Fatui in return for my Gnosis, right?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 16.ogg Nahida: A very important part of the intel was about this world's Descenders... external beings, ones that don't belong to this world.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 17.ogg Nahida: (Traveler), you are Teyvat's "Fourth Descender."
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 18.ogg Nahida: That's right. My current hypothesis is that the "First Descender" was likely what we now call the Heavenly Principles.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 19.ogg Nahida: As for the other Descenders... I still need to verify their existence. It could take me some time.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 20.ogg Nahida: And yet, even knowing all this, I'm sure you must still have a lot of unanswered questions. I must say, I truly regret that I can't help you more as the God of Wisdom...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 21.ogg Nahida: There are many questions in my heart as well. I will need some time to go through each one of them.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 22.ogg Nahida: And soon, you'll also begin your journey anew, and depart from Sumeru.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 23.ogg Nahida: I'm very interested in your future. It's a journey that can't be observed or recorded by this world...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 24.ogg Nahida: If fate is the ultimate knowledge, then your future will be the ultimate fate.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 25.ogg Nahida: The pleasure is all mine... I can't thank you enough.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 26.ogg Nahida: All right, that's enough talk for today. If you ever miss me, just close your eyes — and maybe I'll appear in your dreams~
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 2a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 2b.ogg Nahida: About... your (sister/brother).
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 3a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 3b.ogg Nahida: While you were resting at Gandharva Ville, I took some time to perform an Irminsul search for information on your (sister/brother).
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 4.ogg Nahida: This is true in your case, (Traveler). Irminsul indeed does not have any information on you.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 5.ogg Nahida: However...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 6a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 6b.ogg Nahida: There must be something different about your (sister/brother)... because as it turns out, the world has recorded information on (her/him) after all.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 7a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 7b.ogg Nahida: There's only one possible explanation: (She/He) belongs to this world.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 8.ogg Nahida: According to the records I was able to access, your sibling suddenly appeared in Khaenri'ah...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 9a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 nahida 04e 9b.ogg Nahida: After the Khaenri'ah disaster, (she/he) began (her/his) journey through the seven nations of Teyvat.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Nahida!
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So are we, and that's why we're here to talk with you!
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03d 1.ogg Paimon: Does their archon personally judge people?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 1.ogg Paimon: Huh? You mean...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 10.ogg Paimon: Paimon's sure glad we got to meet you, Nahida.
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 2a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 2b.ogg Paimon: Yeah, isn't Irminsul a repository for all the information and memories of Teyvat? So there shouldn't be anything on (him/her) or (his sister/her brother).
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 3.ogg Paimon: What!?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 4.ogg Paimon: But... nothing about this makes any sense. Wasn't this your first trip to Teyvat?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 5a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 5b.ogg Paimon: What do you mean, "fuzzy"? Did something happen to (her/him)?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 6a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 6b.ogg Paimon: But even that wouldn't explain how (she/he) somehow comes from this world...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 7.ogg Paimon: ...What's a Descender? Paimon's never heard of it...
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 8a.ogg Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 8b.ogg Paimon: Huh!? So the Fatui count three other Descenders before (Traveler)? And (his sister/her brother) isn't even one of them?
Media:vo xmaq305 15 paimon 03e 9.ogg Paimon: Whew... Paimon's head's about to burst from all this crazy new information...
Media:vo xmaq305 2 collei 01.ogg Collei: Good morning, (Traveler)! Looks like you're awake.
Media:vo xmaq305 2 collei 02.ogg Collei: I prepared some breakfast today. Please have a taste! I hope you'll like it.
Media:vo xmaq305 2 collei 03.ogg Collei: Well, now that I've recovered from Eleazar, I'm feeling better than ever. I can even prepare four or five meals a day now!
Media:vo xmaq305 2 collei 04.ogg Collei: Oh, by the way, (Traveler), someone brought a letter for you after you went to sleep last night.
Media:vo xmaq305 2 collei 05.ogg Collei: Oh, I've also heard that you've become heroes here as well. That's amazing!
Media:vo xmaq305 2 collei 06a 1.ogg Collei: Everyone's aware of your abilities, there's no need to be modest.
Media:vo xmaq305 2 collei 06b 1.ogg Collei: Sometimes I'm really envious of strong and confident people like you.
Media:vo xmaq305 2 collei 06b 2.ogg Collei: Oh, you're embarrassing me... Hehe.
Media:vo xmaq305 2 collei 07.ogg Collei: Oh, before you leave, be sure to inform Master Tighnari.
Media:vo xmaq305 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yep yep!
Media:vo xmaq305 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's nice to have you here so we can eat something yummy!
Media:vo xmaq305 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: And Paimon bets they're all delicious!
Media:vo xmaq305 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Nope, Paimon wanted to read the letter with you after you woke up, so Paimon didn't open it. Alright, let's read it now!
Media:vo xmaq305 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh, it's from Nilou.
Media:vo xmaq305 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Ahem~ "We're going to hold a feast at the Grand Bazaar and celebrate Cyno's reinstatement as the General Mahamatra!"
Media:vo xmaq305 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: "As heroes of Sumeru, please be sure to attend. I'll wait for you." The date of the banquet is written on the back... It's in two days.
Media:vo xmaq305 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Anyway, let's go to the Grand Bazaar to have a look!
Media:vo xmaq305 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Tighnari~!
Media:vo xmaq305 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We feel much better. How about you?
Media:vo xmaq305 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: But from the looks of it, you seem to be already busy with work again.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: It seems once Irminsul started getting better, everything else started to recover, too!
Media:vo xmaq305 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: By the way, we have some good news. Cyno got his position back!
Media:vo xmaq305 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Huh? You mean he was already here? Why didn't he come say hi to us...?
Media:vo xmaq305 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Then you probably already know all about the celebration feast!
Media:vo xmaq305 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Huh... But didn't Nilou say in her letter that they would celebrate Cyno? He didn't tell you?
Media:vo xmaq305 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Uh... Come to think of it, Cyno doesn't seem like the type who'd enjoy a celebration feast.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: You and Collei are both Cyno's close friends. Why don't you come to the feast with us?
Media:vo xmaq305 3 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Huh? VIPs? Very important Paimons?
Media:vo xmaq305 3 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Huh!?
Media:vo xmaq305 3 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: That sounds really exhausting...
Media:vo xmaq305 3 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Ah, right! We're here to request permission to head out. Would that be... okay?
Media:vo xmaq305 3 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Yay! Will do!
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 01.ogg Tighnari: Good morning. How do you feel today?
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 02.ogg Tighnari: I'm recovering well, thanks for asking.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 03.ogg Tighnari: It's fine, I'm not that busy, really.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 04.ogg Tighnari: The Eleazar patients have recovered, as well as Haypasia. For now, I only need to tend to my Forest Watcher duties.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 05.ogg Tighnari: Yes, but there are still some residual effects.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 06.ogg Tighnari: The Withering is one example. Though it won't spread anymore, the existing zones won't just disappear. We Forest Rangers will still need to do the work.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 07.ogg Tighnari: Haha, this news is hardly new. He had already mentioned it to me before.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 08.ogg Tighnari: He visited once, but he was afraid of disturbing you while you were resting. He just asked me a few questions and left.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 09.ogg Tighnari: Celebration feast? No, I haven't heard anything about that.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 10.ogg Tighnari: Hmm, perhaps... or, alternatively, he doesn't know about it, either.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 11.ogg Tighnari: Collei has taken over some of my tasks these days. I don't think she'll have time for it... not to mention me.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 12.ogg Tighnari: You see, some "VIPs" have come to the forest recently.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 13.ogg Tighnari: Well, technically speaking, they are former VIPs. The sages involved in recent incidents have begun their training in the Avidya Forest, and the people they had previously imprisoned have all been released.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 14.ogg Tighnari: Yes. He's a little weak, but he isn't injured and his condition is stable.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 15.ogg Tighnari: Lesser Lord Kusanali in her boundless mercy has decided to spare Azar and the other wrongdoers. Supposedly, they were ashamed of their shallow ideologies, and have decided to dedicate the rest of their lives to cultivating wisdom in the Avidya Forest.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 16.ogg Tighnari: When they learned that Lesser Lord Kusanali had defeated The Balladeer and saved Irminsul, they were shocked at first, but also became happy, feeling that the sacred light guiding them on the path of discovering wisdom had begun to shine once again.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 17.ogg Tighnari: As a result, work has increased for the Forest Rangers.
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 18.ogg Tighnari: There's nothing we can do, really...
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 19.ogg Tighnari: But that's another topic. Back to the matter at hand — are you two planning to head out?
Media:vo xmaq305 3 tighnari 20.ogg Tighnari: You've recovered well. You may go, but be careful.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 hushang 01.ogg Hushang: It'll be fine... Besides, it never hurts to get things ready in advance.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 hushang 02.ogg Hushang: That's right! We all think she's amazing, too.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 hushang 03.ogg Hushang: Nilou is an absolute favorite among those of us who frequent the Grand Bazaar. For outlanders, you have a great eye!
Media:vo xmaq305 4 hushang 04.ogg Hushang: Master Zubayr, let's have a vote for the most outstanding audience members next time. I think these two may win!
Media:vo xmaq305 4 hushang 05.ogg Hushang: Ooh, good idea! I wonder where we can find one...
Media:vo xmaq305 4 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Mr. Zubayr, I've finished tallying things up here! Well, except for the guests...
Media:vo xmaq305 4 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: Haha. I was thinking the same thing. The feast will be held sooner or later, right?
Media:vo xmaq305 4 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: (Traveler), Paimon!
Media:vo xmaq305 4 nilou 04.ogg Nilou: You're the best. The other guests haven't even replied yet...
Media:vo xmaq305 4 nilou 05.ogg Nilou: Yeah, I had someone deliver letters to all of our guests, but maybe everyone is still busy with other things.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 nilou 06.ogg Nilou: Ugh, I don't want you giving pictures of me to everyone. I'm satisfied just being able to perform here.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 nilou 07.ogg Nilou: Yeah, and that's why I love it here.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 nilou 08.ogg Nilou: (Traveler) and Paimon, could you help confirm if the letters were actually delivered?
Media:vo xmaq305 4 nilou 09.ogg Nilou: If for some reason they didn't receive the letters, then please tell everyone that there will be a feast here!
Media:vo xmaq305 4 nilou 10.ogg Nilou: Hmm... When I wrote the letters, I heard that Dehya was in Port Ormos, and Alhaitham was at the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 nilou 11.ogg Nilou: As for Cyno, we've only heard that he appears at the Akademiya from time to time...
Media:vo xmaq305 4 nilou 12.ogg Nilou: I'm not too sure about Rahman's whereabouts. My guess is that he's with Dehya.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 nilou 13.ogg Nilou: As for Dunyarzad, I just hope she's feeling better... I sent her a letter, but I was afraid of disturbing her. If you have time, please ask about her for me.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, Nilou~!
Media:vo xmaq305 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We got your letter, so here we are!
Media:vo xmaq305 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh? Are we the only ones that have arrived?
Media:vo xmaq305 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: If you consider enjoying Nilou's dance as having good taste, then almost everybody has good taste!
Media:vo xmaq305 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Because Paimon thinks everybody will love her performance.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: There's always a lot going on at the Grand Bazaar.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Yeah, we can also check out how everything in Sumeru is going now.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Okay, got it. Let's go, (Traveler)!
Media:vo xmaq305 4 sheikhzubayr 01.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: ...Well, there won't be any problems if the feast starts at that time. Everything has already been prepared.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 sheikhzubayr 02.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: *sigh* Is a simple reply really that much to ask of our guests? It's affecting our arrangements.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 sheikhzubayr 03.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: Look, I get it, Sumeru is in an extremely important period of transition right now, but even if your friends are important figures, they shouldn't just ignore your request like this.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 sheikhzubayr 04.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: Nilou is Sumeru's number one celebrity, after all.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 sheikhzubayr 05.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: Hehe, you have no idea how happy I am to talk to people with good taste.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 sheikhzubayr 06.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: Nonsense. It is not for us to determine the value of an audience.
Media:vo xmaq305 4 sheikhzubayr 07.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: But indeed, we could try giving gifts to people with particularly good taste... I heard there's a device in Fontaine called a "Kamera" that can record people's appearances as pictures. Such pictures would make superb gifts...
Media:vo xmaq305 5 geoff 01.ogg Geoff: Yes, it seems Scribe Alhaitham has gone to the House of Daena. You should be able to find him there.
Media:vo xmaq305 5 geoff 02.ogg Geoff: But, you're already the second group of people I've seen looking for him today. He must be quite the busy man.
Media:vo xmaq305 5 geoff 03.ogg Geoff: Mr. Kaveh was just here asking about him. You wouldn't believe how terrible their relationship is... and now you two are here...
Media:vo xmaq305 5 geoff 04.ogg Geoff: Don't tell me everyone's here looking for gossip about the sages?
Media:vo xmaq305 5 geoff 05.ogg Geoff: *ahem* Ah, I see. Sorry, I thought maybe everyone's as interested in rumors about the sages as I am...
Media:vo xmaq305 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm... we haven't seen Alhaitham anywhere. Let's ask that person over there.
Media:vo xmaq305 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ahem, hey there! Have you seen Alhaitham around?
Media:vo xmaq305 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh? Who else was looking for him?
Media:vo xmaq305 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: No way, we're strictly here on business!
Media:vo xmaq305 6 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: This is not just some worthless book. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to find a physical book like this in Sumeru?
Media:vo xmaq305 6 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: Oh? You sound surprised. I thought you would already know the inside story.
Media:vo xmaq305 6 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: Well, I almost became a sage.
Media:vo xmaq305 6 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: Don't sound too surprised now. You're the renowned Kaveh, light of the Kshahrewar. Besides, as a master builder and craftsman, chances are you'll be appointed as a sage, too.
Media:vo xmaq305 6 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: Hmph, what makes you say that? Why would you question my heartfelt sincerity?
Media:vo xmaq305 6 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: Yeah, well, I share a similar sentiment. And anyone who knows you as well as I do would surely do the same.
Media:vo xmaq305 6 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: Hm, it seems that you really can't stand my personality.
Media:vo xmaq305 6 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: Well, then you might as well move out of my house.
Media:vo xmaq305 6 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: Forget what's going on with the Akademiya, haven't you been busy with your construction project? Tell me, when are you going to build yourself a mansion?
Media:vo xmaq305 6 alhaitham 10.ogg Alhaitham: So, what great building did our master architect work on this time?
Media:vo xmaq305 6 alhaitham 11.ogg Alhaitham: No, I think we deserve to know. Where were you when Sumeru needed you most?
Media:vo xmaq305 6 alhaitham 12.ogg Alhaitham: Well, while you were out fiddling around in the desert, many people came together to save Sumeru from a crisis.
Media:vo xmaq305 6 alhaitham 13.ogg Alhaitham: Look, all you really need to know is that Azar and all his accomplices have all been overthrown.
Media:vo xmaq305 6 alhaitham 14.ogg Alhaitham: It's no skin off my nose if you don't believe me. It's not like my Darshan was the one trying to apply for funding from the Grand Sage. Yours, though, on the other hand...
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 01.ogg ???: Just put down that worthless book and tell me what happened in the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 02.ogg ???: It doesn't matter, it's probably just another thing that you used your authority to get your hands on anyway. Just put it aside. Listen, I came back today only to hear that the sages have disappeared!
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 03.ogg ???: Would I be here asking you if I knew? You're the Scribe, not me. So just tell me what you know already!
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 04.ogg ???: Huh?
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 05.ogg Kaveh: ...Hmph. Why do I feel like you don't really mean it?
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 06.ogg Kaveh: Maybe it's because you've never said anything good about me before.
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 07.ogg Kaveh: Ugh, you...!
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 08.ogg Kaveh: See!? This is why I hate discussing anything with you. Your ridiculous and arrogant attitude always gets in the way!
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 09.ogg Kaveh: Hah, what was your first clue?
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 10.ogg Kaveh: Are you threatening me? Stooping to a new low, I see!
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 11.ogg Kaveh: Ugh, and don't change the subject. You? A sage? What a joke. The Akademiya might as well just close tomorrow!
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 12.ogg Kaveh: Don't get me started... I get angry just thinking about it.
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 13.ogg Kaveh: Like I need to tell you! Keep your nose out of my business.
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 14.ogg Kaveh: I was in the desert for a large project, but considering Haravatat's utter ignorance of architectural and aesthetic matters, you probably wouldn't understand.
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 15.ogg Kaveh: Which is truly unfortunate! I can only pity the man who doesn't understand the first thing about beauty and romance. Unlike a true...
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 16.ogg Kaveh: Hold on, wait a second, what do you mean by "when Sumeru needed me most"?
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 17.ogg Kaveh: Hah, and you think I'd believe that?
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 18.ogg Kaveh: Huh? What nonsense are you talking about?
Media:vo xmaq305 6 kaveh 19.ogg Kaveh: You know what? I'll ask around! I'm sure someone knows what's going on here. You're dead if I find out you're lying to me.
Media:vo xmaq305 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Alhaitham should be around here somewhere, right?
Media:vo xmaq305 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, he's over there! But it looks like he might not have time for us...
Media:vo xmaq305 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: ...Are they... having a fight...?
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: Oh, it's you two. What's the matter?
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: Letter?
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: If she addressed the letter to "Alhaitham of the Akademiya," then the letter should have gone to my office.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: I've been busy these days, so I haven't had time to check for any new mail at my office. I only now have some free time to attend to personal matters.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: Of course not. I'm only busy these days because several sages have been dismissed recently, and the whole Akademiya was practically turned upside down.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: That is already the best possible ending for the likes of them.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: Four of the Six Great Sages were possessed by their desire for power and attempted to create a new god. In order to pull it off, they even imprisoned the other two rational sages. To imagine such things could take place in the Akademiya... I don't know where to begin...
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: Yes, at least that's how they're supposed to sound.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: It's said that when the Akademiya was first founded, the Dendro Archon herself established the Six Great Schools, each representing one of the six different types of wisdom.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 10.ogg Alhaitham: Numerous Darshans have sprung up and faded. Only the Six Darshans, attaching themselves to the Six Great Schools, have stood the test of time and obtained permanent seats in the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 11.ogg Alhaitham: Now, the Six Darshans are nearly synonymous with the Six Great Schools, and the leaders selected for the schools are the Six Great Sages.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 12.ogg Alhaitham: Among the Six Great Sages there is one central leader, the Grand Sage.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 13.ogg Alhaitham: Unfortunately, only the sages from Vahumana and Amurta remain now. They were imprisoned for opposing Azar and were only rescued after Azar's downfall.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 14.ogg Alhaitham: Yes. Normally, new sages are selected based on a strict set of criteria.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 15.ogg Alhaitham: Yes, about that... *ahem* You didn't let me finish my sentence.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 16.ogg Alhaitham: The person in charge of personnel affairs nominated me to be the Grand Sage in place of Azar and help Lesser Lord Kusanali manage the Akademiya, but... I refused.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 17.ogg Alhaitham: I'm not even interested in being one of the Six Great Sages. Like I said before, I don't like being a leader.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 18.ogg Alhaitham: That's not my job, either. I'm only responsible for handling important affairs within the Akademiya before the new sages take office.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 19.ogg Alhaitham: Hah, and the first thing I'll do is reject Kshahrewar's application for funding.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 20.ogg Alhaitham: Do we look like friends?
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 21.ogg Alhaitham: His name is Kaveh, my roommate. You could say he's the representative for Kshahrewar scholars.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 22.ogg Alhaitham: Which is exactly why he always has so many problems.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 23.ogg Alhaitham: Such is the work of the Akademiya Scribe.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 alhaitham 24.ogg Alhaitham: All right, I'll see you there.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, Alhaitham!
Media:vo xmaq305 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We're running some errands for Nilou. Have you received her letter?
Media:vo xmaq305 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Nilou said she sent out a letter inviting everyone to a celebration feast in two days at the Grand Bazaar. We'll also be celebrating Cyno's reinstatement as General Mahamatra.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Have you always been so busy with your work?
Media:vo xmaq305 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Tighnari told us they all went to train in the Avidya Forest. Apparently they'll spend the rest of their lives there.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Yeah, you're right. Huh, it feels kinda strange to hear them called that after all this time... But then again, the "Six Great Schools" sounded pretty impressive, too.
Media:vo xmaq305 7 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: So who's managing things in the other four schools now? Do they need to find someone new?
Media:vo xmaq305 7 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Oh, didn't you just say something about becoming a sage? If they pick you, then we'd have a huge connection in Sumeru!
Media:vo xmaq305 7 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Huh!? But... Why!? Ugh, can't you be a little more ambitious?
Media:vo xmaq305 7 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Oh, all right. So are you busy these days trying to find others to take the job?
Media:vo xmaq305 7 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: By the way, who was that other person just now? Is he your friend?
Media:vo xmaq305 7 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Paimon doesn't know! That's why Paimon's asking!
Media:vo xmaq305 7 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: So everything that's happened recently must be a huge change for the people of Sumeru...
Media:vo xmaq305 7 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Well anyway, no matter how busy you are, since you were our planner, remember to attend the celebration feast in two days!
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 01a.ogg Dehya: You kidding? Knowing them and the connections they've got, I'm sure they've heard about it.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: That's right. My lady is feeling better now, so I'm accompanying her for a walk.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Haha, I guess I'm just used to calling you "my lady." Old habits die hard.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: Yeah, I might start losing my edge if I keep being a bodyguard for the Homayanis.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: Heh, I'm not a woman that's easily persuaded. You should know that by now, my lady.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: When I took this job, I had already decided that I'd quit as soon as you recovered. It's time for me to get back out there and chase that horizon.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: I want to take a risky job and put my body to the test again.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: I know. If I hadn't joined in that plan with you, I wouldn't have come up with this idea.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: I guess I still get fired up by that feeling of going all-out in a fight... It made me realize that I'm still a mercenary through and through.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: Life is short, and I'm happy I got to be a part of that operation.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 11.ogg Dehya: But the whole thing also made me realize that there are still many problems in Sumeru, and as a desert-dweller, I'm still not completely ready to settle down on this side of the wall.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 12.ogg Dehya: You mean Alhaitham? Haha, I didn't expect him to still remember that. I thought he was joking.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 13.ogg Dehya: Did he tell you that he suggested that I come work at the Akademiya?
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 14.ogg Dehya: I heard that Azar and his cronies fell from power, and Alhaitham told me that now was a good time to find a job in the Akademiya, but only if I wanted to.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 15.ogg Dehya: Bleh, forget about it. I wouldn't last ten seconds in there...
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 16.ogg Dehya: Alhaitham probably just liked the way I worked and knew I'm good in a fight, so he suggested I find some work in the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 17.ogg Dehya: Haha. The matra have all the talent they need as long as they have Cyno. I prefer to be free to live however I choose.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 18.ogg Dehya: In fact, I chose this job from the very start because I knew it'd be right up my alley.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 19.ogg Dehya: A lion has to return to the wild sooner or later. If anything, being your bodyguard has been unfamiliar territory for me.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 20.ogg Dehya: I'm glad to hear you say that.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 21.ogg Dehya: C'mon, no need for the sad face, it's not like we'll never meet again.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 22.ogg Dehya: Once the whole Dendro Archon thing has settled, everything in Sumeru will take a turn for the better. That makes me happy, too.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 23.ogg Dehya: But a peaceful society will probably mean less demand for mercenaries like me. Before long, we'll be a dying breed, so I'd better get to work while I still can.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 24.ogg Dehya: Well, no... not yet, at least. I promised my lady that I'd stick around until next week.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 25.ogg Dehya: It was probably sent to the inn that we're staying at.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 26.ogg Dehya: My lady has been very energetic lately and keeps taking me on hikes, staying out even into the night. By the time we get back, the receptionist is usually off napping on the job.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 27.ogg Dehya: I bet the letter's at the reception desk. I'll go check later.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 28.ogg Dehya: Ah, sorry to make you two come all the way out here.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 29.ogg Dehya: Count me in, too. But is there some sort of dress code or anything for the feast? Can I just show up looking like this?
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 30.ogg Dehya: Alright, then this is how I'll show up.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 31.ogg Dehya: Sure.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 32.ogg Dehya: The General Mahamatra always comes and goes without a trace. Normally, no one knows his whereabouts.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 33.ogg Dehya: But last time we met, he mentioned he had something to do in Aaru Village. You can try your luck there.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 34.ogg Dehya: As for Rahman, your guess is as good as mine. I only remember he said that he had something to discuss with Cyno... You can ask Cyno when you meet him.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dehya 35.ogg Dehya: Don't mention it. You'd better get going.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 01.ogg ???: Is that Paimon I hear?
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: It's been a while, how are you doing?
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: I'm doing well. I can go as far as saying I've never been happier in my entire life!
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: I don't know if you've heard, but Eleazar has completely disappeared, and all the patients have recovered.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 05.ogg Dunyarzad: Why do you still call me that, Dehya? You've already informed my father of your resignation.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 06.ogg Dunyarzad: You know that my parents and I are fond of you and that we appreciate you very much. It wouldn't be a problem if you wished to continue to be our bodyguard.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 07.ogg Dunyarzad: Well, I remember a friend had someone bring you a message...
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 08.ogg Dunyarzad: Hehe, me neither. But I think Dehya would look great dressed up as a scholar.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 09.ogg Dunyarzad: ...Even if being a mercenary means facing all kinds of danger?
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 10.ogg Dunyarzad: I don't want to see you go... But I'll respect your decision.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 11.ogg Dunyarzad: Oh, did Nilou write to us?
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 12.ogg Dunyarzad: Right, and we tend to leave quite early in the mornings, so the old man on duty is also usually dozing off...
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 13.ogg Dunyarzad: It must be something important for Nilou to specifically write to us like that.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 14.ogg Dunyarzad: Great. I'll be sure to attend!
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 15.ogg Dunyarzad: Since it's being organized by Nilou, I don't think she'll be too picky about that. If anything, I think she'd want to see us as our most natural selves.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 dunyarzad 16.ogg Dunyarzad: Thank you so much for letting us know. We'll see you there!
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: This is Port Ormos, now where could Dehya be...?
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh?
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Dunyarzad! It's been so long since we've seen you!
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Dehya!
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Resignation? You mean you're quitting?
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: So what're you gonna do now if you're not gonna be a bodyguard anymore?
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Huh? But we literally just finished one of the most dangerous jobs ever. Are you getting bored already?
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: We just came from talking with Alhaitham at the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: ...What!?
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Whoa... Paimon can't see you being anything other than a mercenary.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: But you know, if you take him up on the offer, Cyno might actually agree and let you become a matra.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Because you're super amazing!
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Huh? But wait a second, you make it sound like you're leaving now!
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: So have you been in Port Ormos this entire time? We were wondering if you had received a letter from Nilou.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: She heard that you were seen in Port Ormos, so she sent the letter here.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: So what it really sounds like is that the person on duty is always asleep.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: No wonder there wasn't a reply, you never received the letter. Good thing Nilou asked us to come and check on that.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Yes, she said they're preparing a victory feast in the Grand Bazaar, and we'll also be celebrating Cyno's reinstatement as General Mahamatra. She was hoping you could come.
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: The feast will be held in two days, so don't forget!
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: Oh, by the way, do you happen to know where Cyno and Rahman are?
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 21.ogg Paimon: Oh...
Media:vo xmaq305 8 paimon 22.ogg Paimon: Alright, on to our next stop!
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: What brings you here?
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: It seems Gandharva Ville's medical treatment is still as good as ever.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: That's good to hear.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: You're welcome. Tighnari has excellent medical skills, and Collei is quite attentive. It was the best place for you.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: I'm meeting some people.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: I've already talked with Candace and the village chief. They're still at the usual place. You can go there if you'd like to see them.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: But you know one of the people I'm meeting as well.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: Setaria's idea will bring much good to many people.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: Azar has received much-needed punishment, though if you ask me, it may have been too light... *sigh* You probably have already heard.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: Lesser Lord Kusanali has allocated many resources to support and develop the desert. I've done some business for her, and part of it required the assistance of the Eremites.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: I applied for a few batches of educational materials from the Akademiya and sent them to several groups in the desert, as instructed by Lesser Lord Kusanali. I believe the people will make good use of them.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 13.ogg Cyno: Apart from this, the Akademiya is also recruiting scholars that are willing to teach in the desert. I'll let you and Setaria know as soon as I have any more news.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 14.ogg Cyno: We must be persistent about this and maintain these resources to ensure long-term effectiveness.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 15.ogg Cyno: Celebration... feast?
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 16.ogg Cyno: It's the first I've heard of it.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 17.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 18.ogg Cyno: No, not really, but I'll go.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 cyno 19.ogg Cyno: Got it.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's been a while since we last visited Aaru Village.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ah, there's Cyno!
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We recovered well, and Tighnari agreed to let us leave, so now we're out and about again!
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Mm-hmm, and Tighnari is recovering well, too.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Yeah, you're the one who brought us to him when we lost consciousness, right? Thanks for that!
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: But why are you just standing here like a dead tree?
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Oh, you mean Candace?
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Rahman! And... huh? Setaria?
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Uh, well... You're pretty famous in the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Oh, tell us everything!
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: What!?
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Uh, what do you mean?
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Wow, so you want to become a teacher?
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: You're all doing so much for the desert!
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: No, not at all! We're actually here on behalf of Nilou.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Nilou wanted to write to everyone, but she wasn't sure where the letters should be sent, so she asked us to come find everyone personally.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: A celebration feast will be held in two days at the Grand Bazaar. She hopes that all of you would be able to attend.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: At the feast, we'll also be celebrating Cyno's reinstatement as General Mahamatra!
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: Although uh, judging from your appearance, it seems you've already been reinstated... Paimon thought you would only start working for the Akademiya after the feast.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: Tighnari was right, he really didn't know...
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 21.ogg Paimon: Okay, we've got all that down!
Media:vo xmaq305 9 paimon 22.ogg Paimon: Our job here is complete as well. Cyno, remember, party's in two days! Make sure you're there!
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 01.ogg ???: Oh? By King Deshret's blessing, my friend suddenly appears in the desert. Don't tell me you've run into trouble and need us to help now.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 02.ogg Rahman: Don't worry, these are our friends. No need to be so guarded.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 03.ogg Rahman: I'm doing well. Many good things have happened recently.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 04.ogg Rahman: Yeah, you go ahead!
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 05.ogg Rahman: Haha, I can see what you're saying now.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 06.ogg Rahman: Setaria will return to support education here and teach people from the desert.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 07.ogg Rahman: She can't teach everyone on her own, but there are many of us Eremites all over Sumeru. She came to discuss a collaboration with me and hoped that I could bring her ideas to the Eremites.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 08.ogg Rahman: The people of King Deshret suffer from sandstorms, exile, and ignorance. Miss Setaria is more than welcome to come teach here. Her arrival is like a star shining in the desert night.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 09.ogg Rahman: The stars have always guided caravans, thieves, soldiers, and travelers who get lost in the night. They lead those in the dark out of trouble and back to safety.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 10.ogg Rahman: You deserve these compliments. Mercenaries are accustomed to danger and don't fear death, which is why we recognize extraordinary actions that common people would easily overlook.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 11.ogg Rahman: Miss...
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 12.ogg Rahman: Aside from that, I also have some other business to discuss with Cyno.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 13.ogg Rahman: That's exactly what the people here need. Physical books and other related items... If it weren't for Cyno and Lesser Lord Kusanali, I'm afraid we'd never be able to get our hands on them.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 14.ogg Rahman: This is the first time in hundreds of years we've had a glimmer of hope. I think this may be the turning point for the desert.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 15.ogg Rahman: Remember these words? "Here lies our faithful priest, Kasala. His wisdom is a miracle among the people, deserving of high praise and admiration."
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 16.ogg Rahman: I hope people with wisdom like that priest will rise again among the desert-dwellers... then we'll once again see the wisdom and glory that once shook the world.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 17.ogg Rahman: Hahaha, this feast is for you, Cyno. Sounds to me like you'll have to be there.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 rahman 18.ogg Rahman: I still have a lot to handle here. Besides, I need to look after Miss Setaria in the desert, so I'll have to pass.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 01.ogg Setaria: Oh? You... know me?
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 02.ogg Setaria: ...I see.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 03.ogg Setaria: Same here. Really, I feel that my whole life has started to shine after suddenly finding a new direction.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 04.ogg Setaria: Alright, well I suppose I should start by saying...
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 05.ogg Setaria: I've decided to leave the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 06.ogg Setaria: It's not that I've given up on being a scholar... Instead, you could say I've found a new identity.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 07.ogg Setaria: I will no longer pursue research like a typical scholar, but I have not completely given up on my relationship to knowledge either.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 08.ogg Setaria: I plan to leave the Akademiya and return to teach here in the desert.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 09.ogg Setaria: Yes, it's my hope that the Eremites can help me select a group of smart people with the best aptitude for teaching. I'll teach them, and after they've finished learning from me, they can go educate more people.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 10.ogg Setaria: That is the true meaning of education and spreading of knowledge.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 11.ogg Setaria: Oh please, where's all of this coming from? I'm starting to feel a little embarrassed...
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 12.ogg Setaria: At first, I feared it was destined to fail... Everyone knows that the Akademiya doesn't allow scholars to teach in the desert without permission.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 13.ogg Setaria: As you know, all knowledge is under their surveillance and control, and very few desert-dwellers are as lucky as me...
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 14.ogg Setaria: But what I heard at that time has been haunting my heart, as if there were lightning bolts constantly bombarding my soul.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 15.ogg Setaria: "Setaria, you tread a treacherous path, and the longer you ignore it, the tighter the Akademiya's grasp on you will become..."
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 16.ogg Setaria: "Setaria, why haven't you gone home?" "Never forget that the desert that belongs to you lies elsewhere."
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 17.ogg Setaria: These words sparked something in me, and I knew that I had to bring something back to my people after going home.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 18.ogg Setaria: I gathered up the courage to approach the Grand Sage, only to find that he was no longer at the Akademiya. Lord Cyno told me that Azar didn't belong there anymore.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 19.ogg Setaria: Lord Cyno helped me obtain permission to leave the Akademiya for the desert, and accompanied me here to discuss collaboration with members of the Eremites.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 20.ogg Setaria: My plan was able to go smoothly thanks to him and Rahman.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 21.ogg Setaria: Enough about us, are you here to discuss some business, too?
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 22.ogg Setaria: It's rare to see that kind of expression from Lord Cyno... You must not like feasts very much.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 23.ogg Setaria: I'm afraid I won't be able to join you. Although, if you'd be so kind... please give a message to Miss Nilou for me.
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 24.ogg Setaria: ...The message is...
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 25.ogg Setaria: "I'm sorry for how I treated you before, but now I understand the beauty of your dance. It's like a light shining in the sky."
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 26.ogg Setaria: "You and the art you symbolize are not only beautiful, but also lively and powerful, so much so that it was prohibited."
Media:vo xmaq305 9 setare 27.ogg Setaria: "Please keep dancing, and someday, I'll be able to appreciate your art in person."
Nahida shows up for a surprise visit and brings the feast to its climax. Sincere joy flows in the hearts of everyone present.
The feast and celebration of the General Mahamatra in the Grand Bazaar goes as planned. Drinks are flowing, the food is delicious, and the venue is beautifully arranged.
The next day...
Time passes gradually in the wonderful atmosphere, and the beautiful evening feels almost like a dream.
You enjoy a yummy breakfast with Collei, who's been waiting for you...
You tell Setaria's message to Nilou...
