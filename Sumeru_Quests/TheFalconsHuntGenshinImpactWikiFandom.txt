 "Father"...?
Tadhla: That's not the target for this hunt. My apologies.
 "Master"...?
Tadhla: ...
 (Hand over the prey)
 ...
Tadhla: ...
 About Masseira...
Tadhla: He is my father. I am his "Falcon."
 ...
Tadhla: ...
 And...?
Tadhla: Talking the talk is the doings of parrots. Falcons only walk the walk.
 About the hunt...
Masseira: It's the coming-of-age ceremony for Tadhla. I used to train the "Falcons" in the tribe personally, but now... I'm no longer as agile as I once was.
Masseira: After the previous commission, Tadhla said you have her trust. This is why I want to ask you to join in and see the Falcon's growth.
 I see. I'll help.
Masseira: It's very kind of you. Please find Tadhla. She'll give you the details of this hunt.
 About you...
Tadhla: About me...?
Tadhla: There's nothing much to say about me... Are you sure you want to know more about me?
 Is that so strange?
Tadhla: I am a Falcon. I am only allowed to learn about my prey, not any other way around.
Tadhla: So... I am sorry, but I will not betray myself to you.
Liloupar: Be that so? Some advice to you, child: Think for yourself.
 I want to know what kind of person I am working with.
Tadhla: "Person"? No. A "Falcon"? Yes.
Tadhla: Please rest assured. I will not disobey you or leave you behind. It is Father who entrusted me to you.
Liloupar: Heh... A blind-folded Falcon. In what world would she care about how beautiful she is?
 Alright...
 And a friend of ours.
Tadhla: ...
Tadhla: Fine.
 And...?
Tadhla: Talking the talk is the doings of parrots. Falcons only walk the walk.
 Are you alright?
Tadhla: I'm fine.
Paimon: You are bleeding...
Tadhla: It's nothing. Just a scratch.
 Are you hurt?
Tadhla: No... Um... Just a little bit, but it doesn't matter.
Paimon: Don't push yourself too hard.
Tadhla: I won't. Thank you, Paimon.
 Can I take a look?
Tadhla: ...?
Tadhla: Pfft...
Paimon: Eh? What's so funny?
Liloupar: Pretty uncommon for a Falcon, I would say.
Tadhla: It's just... It's kind of funny when you suddenly asked to see how I dissect the Scorpion.
Tadhla: I barely know anyone else who is as interested in taking apart prey as you are. Or are you interested in this for some other reason?
 I'm just worried that your hands might shake.
Tadhla: They do not shake when I hunt. Nor will they shake when I harvest my prey.
Tadhla: No need to worry. I am a "Falcon," after all...
 How is your wound now?
 I didn't mean to make you worry, Tadhla. I'm sorry.
Tadhla: ...
Tadhla: A hunter does not apologize to a Falcon.
Tadhla: It's nothing.
 How is your wound now?
 I don't need any bait.
Tadhla: Then I will watch your back.
 I have other plans.
Masseira: Well then, I shall leave you alone.
 I have some other things to do. I'll be back later.
Tadhla: Suit yourselves.
 I have to finish something else first.
Tadhla: Don't worry, I'll be here waiting for you.
 I see. I'll help.
 I want to know what kind of person I am working with.
Tadhla: "Person"? No. A "Falcon"? Yes.
Tadhla: Please rest assured. I will not disobey you or leave you behind. It is Father who entrusted me to you.
Liloupar: Heh... A blind-folded Falcon. In what world would she care about how beautiful she is?
 I'm just worried that your hands might shake.
 Is that so strange?
Tadhla: I am a Falcon. I am only allowed to learn about my prey, not any other way around.
Tadhla: So... I am sorry, but I will not betray myself to you.
Liloupar: Be that so? Some advice to you, child: Think for yourself.
 It's okay. Let me do it.
Paimon: Yes, you should get some rest!
 It's... Gurabad. Again...
 Leave the rest to me.
Paimon: Yes, from now on, you can totally count on us! Umm, Paimon means you can totally count on (Traveler)!
 Let's go and continue the hunt.
Tadhla: Please follow me.
 Let's go.
Tadhla: Please follow me.
 Let's use the paralyzing poisonous bait.
Tadhla: Very well... Are there any cuts or scratches on your hands?
 Let's use the viper venom bait.
Tadhla: Be careful and don't cut yourself. It'll be a disaster if viper venom gets into your body.
 Liloupar has a point.
 Liloupar, what have you done...
 My head really hurts...
 Paimon's right.
 Please do not have such doubts. Tadhla is extremely capable.
Masseira: I know that, of course. She's my Falcon, after all.
 Please don't push yourself too hard.
Tadhla: It's nothing.
 How is your wound now?
 Please teach me.
Tadhla: Very well.
 Quest DescriptionAfter the previous adventure, it seems that Masseira still has some favor to ask of you...
 Tadhla has done me a big favor.
Masseira: Is that so...
Masseira: Very well. Thank you very much.
 Uh... I'll pass.
Tadhla: Suit yourselves.
 We accept your commission.
Liloupar: *sigh* Really, must we...
 We had a great time.
Masseira: Oh, a great time?
Masseira: Very well. Thank you very much.
 We see you only as our friend.
Tadhla: ...
Tadhla: Thank you.
 What's twinkling over there?
Tadhla: "Fool's Gold." Red Vultures love collecting shiny stuff.
Paimon: "Fool's Gold"... Hmm... Sounds like Fatui's hidden treasure...
Liloupar: "Fool's Gold" are things that only simpletons would believe to be valuable.
Paimon: Paimon certainly wouldn't fall for that!
Tadhla: Shh... You wouldn't want to have any of those. They are mostly commonplace alloys like brass and bronze that are not worth much.
 When will the Red Vulture return?
Tadhla: Not until she no longer feels in danger... Also, even if she senses our presence in the lair, she'd still be forced back here by the piercing cold of midnight.
 You should take a break.
Tadhla: No... If not preserved properly, the poison glands will spoil in the air and become useless.
After all this work, Tadhla lets out a long breath.Her forehead is dotted with tiny beads of sweat, her breaths tremulous... Her fresh wound must really hurt.
After some time, the morning sun lights up the scarlet desert...The sun is up, and you all wake up as the morning dew dries up in sunlight's heat.
After the demonstration, Tadhla shows you her hands soaked by the blood of her prey, a faint smile appearing on her lips.This is the first time that she has revealed any trace of her emotions.
As the shard of light merges with Liloupar's magic bottle, you feel a little of your own power being pulled away...
How is your wound? Is it getting better?
Tadhla: Yes, it doesn't hurt anymore. *grunt* It's okay now.
Liloupar: "Fool's Gold" are things that only simpletons would believe to be valuable.
Liloupar: *sigh* Really, must we...
Liloupar: *sigh*...
Liloupar: ...
Liloupar: A good Falcon knows to cherish their life. Or they will become a burden and be eliminated. Be you a foolish Falcon, child?
Liloupar: Ah... Pardon me, my master, but I... sense my fragment nearby.
Liloupar: Alright, now is not the time for such a topic... Your friends are waiting for you to wake up.
Liloupar: Apologies. Experiencing a Jinni's memories is not necessarily always a pleasant experience.
Liloupar: Be that so? Some advice to you, child: Think for yourself.
Liloupar: But all the scents that greet me are from wild creatures... Ah, it is not so foul.
Liloupar: Falcons get injured, too. There's no need to be ashamed of such facts, little one.
Liloupar: For now, perhaps. Yet, time is like a fraying blade in the desert. Soon, the toxins and the heat will unite against your flesh, inflicting dehydration, and drawing you closer to the rapids of demise.
Liloupar: Heh... A blind-folded Falcon. In what world would she care about how beautiful she is?
Liloupar: Hmph, be silent...
Liloupar: I guess you wanted to say "Let's go!" but you'd better stand down and take a break.
Liloupar: It appears that the little one desires to be slothful again.
Liloupar: It is my soul, my fragments... One is around here...
Liloupar: It is not lethal. But the effects are still deleterious in pain and harm... She will need to rest.
Liloupar: My master, are you feeling alright?
Liloupar: Paimon, you've been holding your nose the whole time.
Liloupar: Pretty soon the day will be searing hot under the sun. If we want to return to the tribe safe and sound, we need to go now.
Liloupar: Pretty uncommon for a Falcon, I would say.
Liloupar: Scorpions are predators. They relish the smell of fresh blood.
Liloupar: She means to say that "It hurts."
Liloupar: She's shaking, as if having a fever... It's the Scorpion's toxin. I know it well.
Liloupar: Should you bear words, give them unto my master now.
Liloupar: That's right. Uh... No, I can't sense the fragment due to the interference of the flying serpents here. Their scents are too thick, too pungent...
Liloupar: The fall of Gurabad... is just a prologue. I merely revealed what torments await.
Liloupar: Wait... I feel it... The familiar... pain.
Liloupar: Well... that's a first for a Falcon.
Liloupar: What have I done? You should see what they have done... With just a nudge, they would have cast themselves down the vile path toward certain ruination.
Masseira: "Friend," huh?
Masseira: (...Before the mist of the morning, before the mirage of the noon, my Falcon takes off...)
Masseira: (...Tadhla... your growth is... too slow...)
Masseira: ...
Masseira: A little later than I expected. What happened, my little Falcon?
Masseira: After the previous commission, Tadhla said you have her trust. This is why I want to ask you to join in and see the Falcon's growth.
Masseira: Ah! If it isn't the esteemed Master of the Jinni, savior of my little Falcon.
Masseira: Ah, esteemed master of the Jinni! And eh... Hmm. I see you have both returned.
Masseira: But... Falcons belong to hunters, not the earth. Once Falcons get attached to the world, their senses and claws will be dull. If that happens, how can I expect them to hunt for me?
Masseira: Esteemed Master of the Jinni, did my Falcon hold you back?
Masseira: Good, very good. It's good to see you're alright.
Masseira: Haha, please, don't get me wrong! I am most happy that my little Falcon has made some new friends! Truly, I am.
Masseira: Here, this is your payment. Please do come find me later. I'll probably have other commissions for you.
Masseira: I know that, of course. She's my Falcon, after all.
Masseira: I will deal with you later.
Masseira: I'm embarrassed to ask but could you do me another favor? It's a hunting task.
Masseira: Is that so...
Masseira: It's the coming-of-age ceremony for Tadhla. I used to train the "Falcons" in the tribe personally, but now... I'm no longer as agile as I once was.
Masseira: It's very kind of you. Please find Tadhla. She'll give you the details of this hunt.
Masseira: My little Falcon, let's talk about your next "hunt," shall we?
Masseira: Oh, a great time?
Masseira: She could be a bit of a handful, but I promise you will be well compensated. So I'm wondering if you would like to...
Masseira: Simply put, this is about Tadhla's coming-of-age ceremony. Please witness her growth for me.
Masseira: Very well. Thank you very much.
Masseira: Well then, I shall leave you alone.
Not yet...
Tadhla: Please don't worry about me. I'm still busy with something...
Paimon: "Fool's Gold"... Hmm... Sounds like Fatui's hidden treasure...
Paimon: Ah, speaking of which, where "is" your nose?
Paimon: Are you awake? Can you not always scare Paimon to death!?
Paimon: Because it stinks of blood...
Paimon: Don't push yourself too hard.
Paimon: Don't say that, you deserve some rest! There's nothing wrong with us helping out when you're not feeling so well. We're friends after all!
Paimon: Don't worry, just leave it to us!
Paimon: Don't worry, we got this. We're experts when it comes to building a campfire!
Paimon: Eh? What's so funny?
Paimon: Eh? What's wrong Tadhla? Are you still feeling unwell?
Paimon: Hey! You shouldn't pinch it with your hands...
Paimon: Hmm... The Red Vulture won't be back anytime soon. Why don't we check out the shiny stuff first?
Paimon: Hmph, Paimon knows when she feels cold and tired! Not everyone is immune to temperature changes like you!
Paimon: Huh!? How is there another one?
Paimon: No, why'd you ask?
Paimon: Ohh... Alright... Paimon will hold her breath anyway!
Paimon: Paimon can smell it, too! Uh... Such a strong smell... Aren't you going to wash it off?
Paimon: Paimon certainly wouldn't fall for that!
Paimon: Paimon doesn't want it!
Paimon: So was Tadhla! When you fell unconscious, she was really nervous and almost cried! Paimon thinks you owe Tadhla an apology!
Paimon: Sounds good to Paimon! The temperature feels just right in here. Let's all just get some good rest for the night!
Paimon: Tadhla is human, and our friend! Not some sort of so-called "Falcon"!
Paimon: Tadhla really has good eyesight.
Paimon: Tadhla! Are you alright?
Paimon: Tadhla! Looks like you're in better spirits now! How's your wound now? Has it healed?
Paimon: Tadhla, you don't look so well. Do you need some rest?
Paimon: That doesn't make any sense to Paimon... But hearing you going on and on about Falcons surely makes Paimon irritated!
Paimon: That's enough, Liloupar. Don't be so harsh to her! And Tadhla, stop treating yourself this way... We really should get some rest before we go!
Paimon: Then let's go deep and take them down!
Paimon: There is no need to apologize! This cave should be able to block out the cold winds at night. Let's set up a campfire right here!
Paimon: Yes, from now on, you can totally count on us! Umm, Paimon means you can totally count on (Traveler)!
Paimon: Yes, you should get some rest!
Paimon: You are bleeding...
Paimon: You look a lot better, Tadhla. How are you feeling?
Tadhla demonstrates how to dissect a prey. You and Paimon seem to have learned a new skill that you probably will never actually put into practice.
Tadhla dissects the prey with great proficiency and wraps it up in a package.
Tadhla fetches some desert poplar branches and dried feces. Soon, a simple campfire is built.Sitting and bathing in its warm light, you all share filling quantities of food and water with each other.Watching the campfire dancing and crackling, you find yourselves absent of any topics to discuss...
Tadhla harvests the Scorpion with ease, removing its poison glands and useless organs, then carefully wraps them up in separate packages.After that, she shows you her stained hands without a change of expression on her face. Somehow you feel that she is trying to prove something to you...
Tadhla prepares the poisonous bait carefully as you wait patiently in the cave until the moon rises...
Tadhla slowly cuts the Scorpion open, harvests its poison glands, and removes the useless organs, and carefully wraps them up in separate packages.While doing this, her hands are nimble and steady, as if playing a soundless musical instrument that is made of blood and chitin....It is only a short while before she finishes the dissection.
Tadhla: "Fool's Gold." Red Vultures love collecting shiny stuff.
Tadhla: "Person"? No. A "Falcon"? Yes.
Tadhla: (...Don't think about it too much, Tadhla, you're just a Falcon...)
Tadhla: (...I must not show weakness, or look afraid...)
Tadhla: (...So thirsty... and hurting... and cold...)
Tadhla: (...The next hunt, huh...)
Tadhla: (...Why can't you let me finish my coming-of-age ceremony on my own...)
Tadhla: *pant* If you need my assistance... please let me know, anytime.
Tadhla: *pant* Yes...
Tadhla: ...
Tadhla: ...?
Tadhla: ...I'll check the Flying Serpent up ahead.
Tadhla: ...It's okay. I'll go take care of our prey.
Tadhla: ...She hasn't returned yet. Please stay put, or she'll be alarmed.
Tadhla: ...Thank you. You didn't have to do this for me.
Tadhla: A hunter does not apologize to a Falcon.
Tadhla: About me...?
Tadhla: Ah... I'm sorry.
Tadhla: Alright, we still need to hunt the Flying Serpent. Let's go.
Tadhla: Alright... Next up, dissection.
Tadhla: Be careful and don't cut yourself. It'll be a disaster if viper venom gets into your body.
Tadhla: But of course, if you have other priorities, I'll wait here until you're all set. Only the prey won't be as patient as I am...
Tadhla: But this method has its merits, too. It avoids any contamination so that we can extract the purest Scorpion venom.
Tadhla: But viper venom is a rare resource. It'll be a huge waste to use it all for the bait... I'll adjust the portions to make sure the bait is just poisonous enough to weaken the Scorpion but not kill it.
Tadhla: By the way, are you wearing any perfume?
Tadhla: Did you finish dealing with the Jinn matter?
Tadhla: Did you rest well? Are we ready to go?
Tadhla: Do you need more rest or should we set out right now?
Tadhla: Don't worry, I'll be here waiting for you.
Tadhla: Droppings and weasel fur... There's still a little moisture. She's not too far away.
Tadhla: Fine.
Tadhla: First option, we can mix the secretions of Sand Grease Pupa with a few ground poisonous mushrooms. Secretions of Sand Grease Pupa should lure the Scorpion to take the bait, then ground poisonous mushrooms can paralyze the Scorpion.
Tadhla: First, the Red Vulture. We have already confirmed its whereabouts. All that needs to be done is to track it down.
Tadhla: Good idea... Let me help... *grunt*
Tadhla: Great, neither am I.
Tadhla: He is my father. I am his "Falcon."
Tadhla: Hello, thank you for your help.
Tadhla: Here we are.
Tadhla: Hmm... It's been better. Let's head back.
Tadhla: Hmm... The smell of blood. Good.
Tadhla: Hmph...
Tadhla: I am a Falcon. I am only allowed to learn about my prey, not any other way around.
Tadhla: I am but a Falcon of Masseira's.
Tadhla: I barely know anyone else who is as interested in taking apart prey as you are. Or are you interested in this for some other reason?
Tadhla: I can smell the lair. Yes, it is right there.
Tadhla: I was not...
Tadhla: I won't. Thank you, Paimon.
Tadhla: I'll leave the final choice to you. Please take your time.
Tadhla: I'm feeling much better now... Come on, let's go.
Tadhla: I'm fine.
Tadhla: I'm not.
Tadhla: I... Do not...
Tadhla: I... I am very happy to hunt with you.
Tadhla: It has been weakened. Let's go!
Tadhla: It's decently chilly in this lair, our prey's meat should be able to stay overnight and not go bad... We could spend the night here to avoid the cold outside.
Tadhla: It's embarrassing to say. I... I got injured. But thanks to the Master of the Jinni, I'm okay now.
Tadhla: It's here. Let's go!
Tadhla: It's just... It's kind of funny when you suddenly asked to see how I dissect the Scorpion.
Tadhla: It's nothing.
Tadhla: It's nothing. Just a scratch.
Tadhla: It's working. Let's go!
Tadhla: Let's follow her back to the nest.
Tadhla: Let's go.
Tadhla: No need to worry about me. Master... I mean, my father must have given you this commission.
Tadhla: No need to worry. I am a "Falcon," after all...
Tadhla: No need. I'm okay.
Tadhla: No, I'm great.
Tadhla: No, because we are going to hunt the Scorpion now.
Tadhla: No... If not preserved properly, the poison glands will spoil in the air and become useless.
Tadhla: No... It's not like that...
Tadhla: No... Um... Just a little bit, but it doesn't matter.
Tadhla: Not until she no longer feels in danger... Also, even if she senses our presence in the lair, she'd still be forced back here by the piercing cold of midnight.
Tadhla: Now we must wait with patience.
Tadhla: Oh, one more thing. When fighting with the Scorpion, we must be very careful. Its toxin can be lethal.
Tadhla: Oh, you are finally awake. Paimon was so worried about you...
Tadhla: Or, we can mash up a mixture of Henna Berries and viper venom. Then make some poisonous bait by adding fresh meat into the mush. We fight fire with fire.
Tadhla: Paw prints... Ah, it's covered with sand. She landed here, apparently noticing that someone was following her...
Tadhla: Pfft...
Tadhla: Please don't worry about me. I'm still busy with something...
Tadhla: Please follow me.
Tadhla: Please follow me. We have already confirmed its whereabouts. All that needs to be done is to track it down.
Tadhla: Please leave the rest to me. If you really are interested in this, I can teach you step by step.
Tadhla: Please rest assured. I will not disobey you or leave you behind. It is Father who entrusted me to you.
Tadhla: Red Vultures are careful and wicked by nature. She's probably sensed the danger and fled already, leaving us an empty lair.
Tadhla: Scorpions are only active under the veil of night. There is still some time before the night falls. Why don't we plan how we hunt the Scorpion?
Tadhla: See? It's just a scratch. For a Falcon, it's nothing to worry about.
Tadhla: She must have dropped these while fighting over food... Female, smelling of carrion... She's had a good meal and should be back in the nest soon.
Tadhla: Shh... You wouldn't want to have any of those. They are mostly commonplace alloys like brass and bronze that are not worth much.
Tadhla: So... I am sorry, but I will not betray myself to you.
Tadhla: Sorry for not being helpful...
Tadhla: Suit yourselves.
Tadhla: Talking the talk is the doings of parrots. Falcons only walk the walk.
Tadhla: Thank you for asking. Yes, it has healed... but left an indelible scar.
Tadhla: Thank you.
Tadhla: That's not the target for this hunt. My apologies.
Tadhla: That's right.
Tadhla: The toxin is not strong enough to kill it, but would very well suffice to immobilize it.
Tadhla: Then I will watch your back.
Tadhla: There are three targets for this hunt: the Red Vulture, the Scorpion, and the Flying Serpent.
Tadhla: There's also a third method... Not a clever one though. We risk our lives to hunt it down without any of preparation.
Tadhla: There's nothing much to say about me... Are you sure you want to know more about me?
Tadhla: They do not shake when I hunt. Nor will they shake when I harvest my prey.
Tadhla: This is her lair.
Tadhla: This place is a habitat for flying serpents. Seems this oasis is powered by one of the Jinni's fragments and has become an ecosystem for them...
Tadhla: Time to get up. Let's go.
Tadhla: Very well.
Tadhla: Very well... Are there any cuts or scratches on your hands?
Tadhla: We need to wait patiently... They should've smelled the blood, but they wont be active before the night falls.
Tadhla: We will stay here and wait until midnight. Please have a rest if you are tired. I'll keep watch.
Tadhla: Well then, let's go.
Tadhla: What are you doing? Come back!
Tadhla: What is that over there?
Tadhla: What is that? Let's take a closer look.
Tadhla: Why? You want it?
Tadhla: Yes, it doesn't hurt anymore. *grunt* It's okay now.
Tadhla: Yes...
Tadhla: You are such a talented hunter. No wonder Father commissioned you to help me with this hunt.
Tadhla: You can use them to cover your own scent. It will help.
Then, the merciless era of the Spirit of Victory began... The crazed king and the nobles rejoiced in their superiority...Yet none were aware that all the happenings within Gurabad were created by the scheming hands of the Mother of the Jinn...
Through the Jinni's entranced eyes, you see a vortex of decay and betrayal...The Spirit of Victory fell into madness due to a signet ring most dark, and in a series of tragedies, Queen Shirin brewed the honey-colored catastrophe before her mind yielded to hysteria...The people turned against each other, and the Jinn scattered across the lands... Broken souls became fuel to a titanic machine, and the mindless descendants of the Seelie were degraded into slaves of infinite power...
You build a simple campfire and cook some food together with Paimon.Tadhla drinks some water and falls asleep soon...Her body is mildly over-warm. Under the influence of the dehydration and fatigue inflicted by the Scorpion's venom, Tadhla sinks into a deep slumber. You can tell that the pain is wearing off on her...
You should have a rest here.
Tadhla: ...
Your condition is not suitable for hunting.
Tadhla: Hmph...
