(After defeating the Ruin Drake)
Paimon: Well, the Ruin Drake is gone. Let's go wake up Araphala.
Paimon: He won't be afraid to leave that cave now!

Araphala: I don't want to go outside while such a scary and huge monster is roaming the area. I'm sorry, my "sister."
Paimon: Oh, Paimon sees. But Festival Utsava is coming, you should return home.
Araphala: Festival Utsava is meant to be carefree, but I'll care for my life if I leave this place. *snore* I can't do that for Festival Utsava...
Araphala: *snore* *snore* Nara Varuna...
Paimon: Ugh... This guy...
Paimon: What do we do, (Traveler)?
 Let's deal with the big scary monster.
 Ah, that huge monster! So scary!
Paimon: ...Paimon doesn't think anything can be scarier than Stormterror. In fact, Paimon wonders how Aranara would describe Stormterror?
 "A million Araphalas tall!"
Paimon: "To walk from its tail to the head, the moon will rise and fall!"
Paimon: C'mon, let's help him deal with that monster outside.
(Talk to Araphala again)
Araphala: *snore* When will you be back? *snore*
 (Let's wake him up once we take care of the monster...)

Paimon: Speaking of which, we did see a Ruin Drake on the way here. Is that the huge monster you mentioned?
Araphala: Is that how Nara call it? Perhaps. Very likely.
 We've taken care of it.
 Ah, that huge monster! So scary!
Paimon: ...Was it that scary though?
Araphala: Yes, looks like Nara understands that it's very scary.
Paimon: Don't worry. (Traveler) had defeated that huge monster before we met you!
Araphala: Whoa! I didn't expect Nara (Traveler) who looks smaller than the monster to be so strong!
Araphala: Alright, then let's go. Good Nara, let's eat fruits together.
 "A million Araphalas tall!"
 (Let's wake him up once we take care of the monster...)
 Ah, that huge monster! So scary!
 Ah, that huge monster! So scary!
Paimon: ...Was it that scary though?
Araphala: Yes, looks like Nara understands that it's very scary.
Paimon: Don't worry. (Traveler) had defeated that huge monster before we met you!
 I don't think so...
Paimon: Right? It's kinda strange to call something that hasn't been, y'know, processed... a dish.
 I think so?
Paimon: It still seems a bit strange to Paimon...
 Indeed he is.
 It is a fruit after all.
 It sounds really tough...
 It sounds so convenient!
 It was alright.
 It was quite difficult.
 Let's deal with the big scary monster.
 No one will make you into porridge.
 Paimon, can you turn into a seed?
Paimon: Hey, do you have any problem with Paimon!?
 Quest DescriptionAccording to Arachatora, his brother Araphala is doing "cooking training" close by Devantaka Mountain. Look for a pillar of smoke near Devantaka Mountain!
 Seven.
Paimon: Whoa! As expected of (Traveler)! What an amazing memory!
 Step DescriptionDefeat the Ruin Drake in the cave entrance so Araphala will not be afraid anymore.
 We've taken care of it.
 You do look pretty tasty!
Araphala: Waaah!!
Paimon: Hey! (Traveler), don't make jokes like that! Araphala, no one will cook you!
 Your memory is amazing as well, Paimon.
Paimon: Hee—hee...
(Talk to Araphala)
Araphala: *snore* *snore*
Paimon: Araphala!
Araphala: Huh? Oh, it's Paimon.
Paimon: Yeah, we are here to tell you that (Traveler) has taken down the huge monster outside!
Araphala: Whoa! I didn't expect Nara (Traveler) who looks smaller than the monster to be so strong!
 It was alright.
 It was quite difficult.
Araphala: Alright, then let's go. Good Nara, let's eat fruits together.
???: *snore* *snore*
???: Mmm... Tasty fruits... *snore*
???: Oh? It's you. Long time no see.
???: Who am I... Ugh, so dizzy. Let me think... My name is...
???: Whoa, where am I? Is this a cave? Ugh... I'm feeling dizzy.
Araphala starts cooking right away...He divides the fruits equally...Then, he gives a few portions to you and Paimon.
Araphala: "Sleeping"? Oh, I was just thinking about the past. It wasn't that serious.
Araphala: *snore* *snore*
Araphala: *snore* *snore* Nara Varuna...
Araphala: *snore* When will you be back? *snore*
Araphala: *sob* I'm not ready yet. Don't make porridge out of me...
Araphala: ...Really?
Araphala: Ah, it's time for Festival Utsava, is it?
Araphala: Alright, then let's go. Good Nara, let's eat fruits together.
Araphala: And it was so tough! Even if Arama and Arabalika were there, it would take them some effort to tear it apart.
Araphala: Arapacati? Is she doing well? How long have I been here...
Araphala: Araphala... You know my name...
Araphala: But I know that all Nara must sleep. I had a Nara friend once, a Golden Nara just like you.
Araphala: But still... How did I drop so many...
Araphala: But while I was picking fruits... Yes, while I was picking fruits, a really huge monster appeared.
Araphala: Did I drop that many? But it's okay, hehe... I've kept the freshest and tastiest with me.
Araphala: Don't you Nara have a dish where you cut fruits and serve them on a wooden board too?
Araphala: Eh? Nara!?
Araphala: Festival Utsava is coming, I must... *snore* I must hurry up...
Araphala: Festival Utsava is meant to be carefree, but I'll care for my life if I leave this place. *snore* I can't do that for Festival Utsava...
Araphala: Hmm... How should I put this... We hibernate when we are in grave danger, and we compress our memories and dreams into a seed.
Araphala: Huh? Oh, it's Paimon.
Araphala: I can return proudly to Vanarana.
Araphala: I don't want to go outside while such a scary and huge monster is roaming the area. I'm sorry, my "sister."
Araphala: I once came here with (her/him) to gather the Unrivaled Fresh Fruits.
Araphala: I remember leaving with my brothers for cooking training. But they didn't know that fresh fruits are the best ingredients...
Araphala: I understand. To Nara, all fruits may be the same, but they are different.
Araphala: I've picked Unrivaled Fresh Fruits and made my Supreme Delicacy. My cooking training is complete.
Araphala: I've picked so many of them this time... Eh? Where did they go?
Araphala: If the crisis is averted and the time is right, the seed will return to the forest and grow into Aranara again.
Araphala: Indeed, indeed... Sister will scold me if I miss Festival Utsava... Just the thought of it is scary enough.
Araphala: Is that how Nara call it? Perhaps. Very likely.
Araphala: It sure is.
Araphala: Just taste it and you will understand.
Araphala: My name is Araphala! Hehe, I remember now...
Araphala: M—My sister said that if I'm always half asleep like this, a bad Nara will take me and make porridge out of me...
Araphala: Not kidding?
Araphala: Oh, I would've missed Festival Utsava if Nara (Traveler) and Paimon didn't take care of that huge monster that blocked me here in this cave.
Araphala: Oh, don't be a stickler for things like that. Finding better ingredients is a form of cooking too.
Araphala: Oh, it's been so long. Oh no.
Araphala: Okay, let's start cooking with the Unrivaled Fresh Fruits.
Araphala: Only strong trees can bear Unrivaled Fresh Fruits. Strong trees sing first when the wind blows.
Araphala: So good. Thank you, strong trees.
Araphala: So, I've been picking them here since then. If (she/he) returns, or if I make new Nara friends, we can eat them together.
Araphala: That huge monster was five Araphalas tall and had a long tail. Even the ground quaked beneath its stomps. Besides that, I think I sensed Marana's aura inside it.
Araphala: The Unrivaled Fresh Fruit itself is the best Supreme Delicacy. It doesn't need any extra processing to present its best taste...
Araphala: The bearings of the strong trees, these Unrivaled Fresh Fruits, are a blessing to us. That Nara friend said these fruits are so tasty they sing in your stomach.
Araphala: Ugh... But I haven't completed my cooking training yet...
Araphala: Waaah!!
Araphala: While searching for ingredients, I can travel the forest and get closer to it. That's the true meaning of my cooking training.
Araphala: Whoa! I didn't expect Nara (Traveler) who looks smaller than the monster to be so strong!
Araphala: Yes, but I'm not. So, I had to hide here. I was thinking about the past as I waited for it to leave, and the next thing I knew, you two were standing in front of me.
Araphala: Yes, looks like Nara understands that it's very scary.
Leaf With Careful Penmanship: "...Branches turned green. I didn't find any fruits..."
Leaf With Careful Penmanship: "...Leaves turned yellow. I picked a fresh and tasty Sunsettia."
Leaf With Careful Penmanship: "Leaves are growing again, and 40 moons have passed. I picked Sunsettias outside the campsite and brought them back to Vanarana, but sister said they were still very unripe..."
Leaf With Careful Penmanship: (A huge leaf. Someone has written on it with neat handwriting...)
Paimon: "How long," you say? Well, if Paimon recalls correctly...
Paimon: "To walk from its tail to the head, the moon will rise and fall!"
Paimon: ...Paimon doesn't think anything can be scarier than Stormterror. In fact, Paimon wonders how Aranara would describe Stormterror?
Paimon: ...Was it that scary though?
Paimon: Alright, hurry back to Vanarana!
Paimon: Anyway, let's bring you up to speed. Festival Utsava is coming up...
Paimon: Araphala!
Paimon: C'mon, let's help him deal with that monster outside.
Paimon: Don't worry. (Traveler) had defeated that huge monster before we met you!
Paimon: He won't be afraid to leave that cave now!
Paimon: He's wide awake now.
Paimon: Hee—hee...
Paimon: Hey! (Traveler), don't make jokes like that! Araphala, no one will cook you!
Paimon: Hey! Hello—!
Paimon: Hey, do you have any problem with Paimon!?
Paimon: Hi there!
Paimon: Huh? Do we? Wait! Are you talking about a fruit platter?
Paimon: Huh? Is sleeping something serious for Aranara?
Paimon: Huh? It's an Aranara... Could it be Arapacati's older brother?
Paimon: Huh? Weren't you sleeping? Paimon thought...
Paimon: Huh? Why are these fruits scattered on the ground?
Paimon: Huh? Why would anyone want to make porridge out of you!?
Paimon: Is a fruit platter considered a dish?
Paimon: Is it?
Paimon: It is tasty, but it's just... it's just like eating fruits...
Paimon: It still seems a bit strange to Paimon...
Paimon: Let's return to Arapacati...
Paimon: No kidding! Anyway, Paimon's name is Paimon, and this tall Nara is (Traveler). Arapacati sent us...
Paimon: Oh, Paimon sees. But Festival Utsava is coming, you should return home.
Paimon: Paimon can't wait to see what kind of delicacy will be made from them!
Paimon: Paimon will leave it to you, (Traveler).
Paimon: Really!
Paimon: Right? It's kinda strange to call something that hasn't been, y'know, processed... a dish.
Paimon: So you're Araphala! We were wondering where you'd gone... and here you were, sleeping in this cave the whole time!
Paimon: So, it's you who dropped those Sunsettias we saw all along the way.
Paimon: Speaking of which, we did see a Ruin Drake on the way here. Is that the huge monster you mentioned?
Paimon: There is a camp here... But Arapha... Ara... Ugh! Aranara names are so difficult!
Paimon: Ugh, he's in deep slumber. Oh, right. Arapacati mentioned that the power of Dendro should do the trick.
Paimon: Ugh... This guy...
Paimon: Uhh... Many, many moons ago, the seedlings sprouted from the earth, and became trees... How many Arapacatis tall were they again?
Paimon: Wait! You call that cooking?
Paimon: Wait!? They are that strong!?
Paimon: Well, Aracha... Ara... Er, forget it. The four brothers have all been notified!
Paimon: Well, the Ruin Drake is gone. Let's go wake up Araphala.
Paimon: What do we do, (Traveler)?
Paimon: What's the difference between this "Unrivaled Fresh Fruit" and ordinary fruits?
Paimon: Who are you? Why are you sleeping here?
Paimon: Whoa! As expected of (Traveler)! What an amazing memory!
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon guesses so...
Paimon: Yeah, so Arapacati wants you back in Vanarana.
Paimon: Yeah, we are here to tell you that (Traveler) has taken down the huge monster outside!
You bring Araphala up to speed on the events so far...
You try the fresh fruits together.It sort of lives up to your expectations. They do taste like fresh fruits.
