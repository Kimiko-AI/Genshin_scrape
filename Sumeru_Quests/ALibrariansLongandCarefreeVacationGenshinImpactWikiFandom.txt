Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 41.ogg Lisa: I see... Even I didn't expect them to be so bent on their pursuit, wanting to even surpass the gods...
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 42.ogg Lisa: Sounds like you were involved in some remarkable events again, and I was completely unaware.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 43.ogg Lisa: And to think you were even able to handle a crisis of that magnitude... Cutie, your abilities are really beyond measure.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 44.ogg Lisa: Having accomplished such a feat, I'm sure you must have a lot on your plate right now. I was actually thinking about inviting you two to walk around Sumeru with me...

Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 45.ogg Lisa: I see... So you came to Sumeru in search of information on Lesser Lord Kusanali, the God of Wisdom.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 46.ogg Lisa: The two of you have more pressing issues than entertaining a tourist like me.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 47.ogg Lisa: I wanted to walk around Sumeru with you, but now doesn't seem like the right time.
 (It's Lisa!)
 (What is she doing here?)
 Actually, I am proficient with all sorts of weapons.
 I am experienced at using elemental powers in battle.
 I know a lot about Elemental Reactions.
 I'm not that busy.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 49a 1.ogg Lisa: Oh? Then would you like to spend some time with me, darling? That would be wonderful.
 I'm skilled with one-handed swords.
 Keep your voice down.
 Long time no see, Lisa.
 Maybe later.
 Only as project volunteers.
 Quest DescriptionEffendi, the Akademiya's Liaison Officer, is looking for suitable volunteers for a long-term research project under the Spantamad Darshan...
 Recruiter?
 Shh, Paimon.
 That is Lisa's style.
 The more Mora, the better.
 We didn't want to interrupt your conversation.
 We want something a little more lucrative.
 What are the requirements?
 Which is when we happened to run into you, Lisa.
 Why did you choose to leave the Akademiya?
 Yep.
 You mean Gafoor?
Gafoor: (Don't get hurt, or I'll have to cover the damages... I don't wanna pay from my own pocket!)
Media:vo dialog lxeq001 lisa 01.ogg Lisa: I remember you two agreed to meet Gafoor in Mawtiyima Forest to talk about the Ley Lines research job.
Media:vo dialog lxeq001 lisa 02.ogg Lisa: Feel free to leave if you want to go look for him. As for me, I think I'll spend a little more time at Puspa Café.
Media:vo lxeq001 1 effendi 01.ogg Effendi: Greetings! Welcome to the Citadel of Regzar. Would you be interested in taking on some commissions?
Media:vo lxeq001 1 effendi 02.ogg Effendi: Uh, ahem... We don't currently have any commissions like that. However, I do have some relatively simple requests from residents that will pay several thousand Mora.
Media:vo lxeq001 1 effendi 03.ogg Effendi: Ah, I see. Let me think... Spantamad recently initiated a research project on the Ley Lines and is looking for paid volunteers.
Media:vo lxeq001 1 effendi 04.ogg Effendi: There are several researchers in Spantamad who specialize in studying Ley Lines, so there is a great demand for Ley Lines data. Researchers often need to enter Domains to investigate Ley Line Disorders.
Media:vo lxeq001 1 effendi 05.ogg Effendi: They have been understaffed for some time, even after recruiting a good number of their own students. So now they've turned to recruiting large numbers of volunteers.
Media:vo lxeq001 1 effendi 06.ogg Effendi: They offer substantial pay, but they also have strict requirements for the quality of the volunteers. Are you interested?
Media:vo lxeq001 1 effendi 07.ogg Effendi: Yes, let's walk through the recruitment process... First of all, "are you proficient with one or more types of weapon?"
Media:vo lxeq001 1 effendi 08.ogg Effendi: Very good. "How's your understanding of elements? Are you capable of using elemental powers?"
Media:vo lxeq001 1 effendi 09.ogg Effendi: Alright... I'll put you down as the Traveler, right? Okay, I've finished the registration. I'll be coordinating the necessary supplies and payments for volunteers later.
Media:vo lxeq001 1 effendi 10.ogg Effendi: You'll have to find Gafoor for more details about the job. However, he has an important visitor today, so I don't think he'll be in the Akademiya.
Media:vo lxeq001 1 effendi 11.ogg Effendi: According to the standard protocol for receiving visitors, he will most likely bring the visitor to the Puspa Café. You can go there and talk to him when his time with the visitor has finished.
Media:vo lxeq001 1 effendi 12.ogg Effendi: He sounded like he was in quite the rush to recruit volunteers when he contacted me, but now he's showing a visitor around. Seriously, who could be so important...?
Media:vo lxeq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Are there any easy jobs where we can earn loads of Mora for just standing around? Oh, better yet, for sitting around! That's the kind of task we're interested in now.
Media:vo lxeq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Really, that's all? That isn't nearly enough for Paimon.
Media:vo lxeq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yeah. Effendi, are there any high-paying commissions available?
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 01.ogg Gafoor: Do you still remember what the coffee's like here?
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 02.ogg Gafoor: Oh, well it's nothing really. It's just that ever since you left the Akademiya, our original projects and plans have lost their backbone, so to speak.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 03.ogg Gafoor: Cyrus is also disappointed. He's always valued you as a proud disciple.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 04.ogg Gafoor: To be honest, it's a real shame that you left the Akademiya, Lisa.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 05.ogg Gafoor: With your wisdom and intellect, had you stayed in the Akademiya, you would have become a Herbad by now.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 06.ogg Gafoor: Well, I heard that you're currently the librarian for the Knights of Favonius in Mondstadt. If you ask me, that's a tragic waste of your talents.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 07.ogg Gafoor: Why waste your time and energy on something as trivial as taking care of a library? Your time is much more valuable than that.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 08.ogg Gafoor: If you're willing to come back to the Akademiya, I have plenty of projects for you to preside over right away. The Akademiya needs people right now, and some of these projects are quite important...
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 09.ogg Gafoor: As a matter of fact, he has long wanted you to come back and work at the Akademiya.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 10.ogg Gafoor: ...
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 11.ogg Gafoor: Excuse me, but what business do you two have here?
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 12.ogg Gafoor: No, no, the paid volunteers are for a conventional project to monitor the Ley Lines. All operations follow the prescribed safety protocols.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 13.ogg Gafoor: We rely on a lot of manpower to collect the data; there's no way around it now. But if only you would agree to come back and preside over some matters, we wouldn't have to go through all this nonsense.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 14.ogg Gafoor: Since you two are here to apply for the project, then please wait a moment while I talk to Lisa...
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 15.ogg Gafoor: Aren't you even a little bit interested?
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 16.ogg Gafoor: I thought after all this time, you would have a different answer. But you're still as obstinate as ever, Lisa.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 17.ogg Gafoor: You've made yourself clear. I'll only make a fool of myself if I keep insisting.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 18.ogg Gafoor: In that case, I still have unfinished business to take care of, so I'll take my leave. See you at the Darshan reunion in a few days.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 19.ogg Gafoor: As for you two, please come see me later in the Mawtiyima Forest when you're free. We'll need your help with the volunteer work.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 20.ogg Gafoor: Oh, and one last thing, Lisa...
Media:vo lxeq001 2 gafoor 21.ogg Gafoor: I wish you the best of luck in Mondstadt.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 01.ogg ???: Of course, how could I forget? It used to be my go-to drink here.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 02.ogg ???: Listen, Gafoor... Ahem, I suppose I should call you Professor Gafoor now... We're old acquaintances, so how about we stop beating around the bush, hmm?
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 03.ogg ???: First you wanted to catch up, and now the coffee... If you have something to say, just say it.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 04.ogg Lisa: If I'm reading the situation right, you're reminiscing about the past to convince me to come back, aren't you?
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 05.ogg Lisa: Yawn... So all this talk IS to convince me to come back. I'm guessing Professor Cyrus doesn't know that you're talking to me about this.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 06.ogg Lisa: ...Is that so? You know, Professor Gafoor, it isn't a good idea to lie to people.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 07.ogg Lisa: Our teacher knows exactly why I left the Akademiya after only two years. He would never ask me to come back.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 08.ogg Lisa: Giving up my life in Mondstadt and returning to the Akademiya as a Spantamad researcher... The price of seeking wisdom is no longer something I'm willing to pay.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 09.ogg Lisa: So please, don't bother trying to get me to come back.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 10.ogg Lisa: Besides, taking care of a library IS important work. I've never considered it a waste of my time.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 11.ogg Lisa: "Wisdom is hidden in every corner of the world. Never underestimate wisdom, no matter how small it may appear!" That's what our teacher always said.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 12.ogg Lisa: A good scholar wouldn't overlook the small details, Gafoor. *sigh* I'm sorry, I'm still not used to calling you "Professor." Nevertheless, the underlying meaning of what you just said is simply wrong.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 13.ogg Lisa: And there's one other detail you probably haven't noticed... Two people have been eavesdropping on us for quite a while now.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 14.ogg Lisa: Is there anything we can help you two with?
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 15.ogg Lisa: Well, if it isn't you two.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 16.ogg Lisa: Long time no see, cutie, Paimon.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 17.ogg Lisa: A research project on Ley Lines? Oh darling, you haven't joined the Akademiya, have you?
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 18.ogg Lisa: Paid volunteers? Gafoor, is the Akademiya really that understaffed? Or are there projects that insist on the use of outsiders...?
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 19.ogg Lisa: If memory serves me right, collecting Ley Lines data requires investigators to go deep into Domains, which can be dangerous.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 20.ogg Lisa: It's been so long now, I can only imagine what wonderful stories you have to share.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 21.ogg Lisa: I'm sorry, Gafoor, my answer is still no.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 22.ogg Lisa: I have never regretted my decision to leave the Akademiya... and I don't think that will change in the future.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 23.ogg Lisa: Yes. Don't worry, I'll be there on time.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 24.ogg Lisa: Yes?
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 25.ogg Lisa: ...Thank you.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 26.ogg Lisa: Well then, cuties, now that the recruiter is gone, we can sit down and have a good chat.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 27.ogg Lisa: Hehe, much has been happening within the Akademiya, and Gafoor is paving the way for his future.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 28.ogg Lisa: Of course, Jean gave me an extended paid vacation. It's rare that I get any time off, so I thought to myself, "Why not go on a trip and relax a little?"
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 29.ogg Lisa: I don't know how much of our conversation you heard, but I studied in the Spantamad Darshan at the Akademiya for two years.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 30.ogg Lisa: But instead of staying at the Akademiya after graduation, I went back to Mondstadt to become the librarian for the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 31.ogg Lisa: You'd like to know, wouldn't you? Well... I guess it wouldn't hurt if I told you. After all, it was ages ago.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 32.ogg Lisa: If anything, it all boils down to a difference in philosophy.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 33.ogg Lisa: When I first came to the Akademiya, Professor Cyrus really appreciated my work and invited me to participate in several major projects.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 34.ogg Lisa: But most of those projects ended in failure. To be honest, they went too far trying to achieve wisdom beyond mortal understanding, so failure was only to be expected.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 35.ogg Lisa: I didn't want any part of that lunacy, so I left. Anyway, now that I told you, make sure you keep it between us.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 36.ogg Lisa: I don't wish to return to the Akademiya, even if Professor Cyrus came to ask me personally.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 37.ogg Lisa: Rather than conducting experiments day and night, I'm much more suited for working hours that start after 10:00 AM, with regular afternoon tea every day.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 38.ogg Lisa: I prefer to take things at my own pace when it comes to tiring tasks like a job. And besides, being able to take regular vacations is also really important.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 39.ogg Lisa: It's a pity I didn't even have time to visit that child in Gandharva Ville yet. Gafoor found me just after I arrived in Sumeru.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 40.ogg Lisa: Speaking of which, what about you two? What brings my favorite cuties to Sumeru?
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 41.ogg Lisa: I see... Even I didn't expect them to be so bent on their pursuit, wanting to even surpass the gods...
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 42.ogg Lisa: Sounds like you were involved in some remarkable events again, and I was completely unaware.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 43.ogg Lisa: And to think you were even able to handle a crisis of that magnitude... Cutie, your abilities are really beyond measure.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 44.ogg Lisa: Having accomplished such a feat, I'm sure you must have a lot on your plate right now. I was actually thinking about inviting you two to walk around Sumeru with me...
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 45.ogg Lisa: I see... So you came to Sumeru in search of information on Lesser Lord Kusanali, the God of Wisdom.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 46.ogg Lisa: The two of you have more pressing issues than entertaining a tourist like me.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 47.ogg Lisa: I wanted to walk around Sumeru with you, but now doesn't seem like the right time.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 48.ogg Lisa: What a pity. It's very rare for us to meet like this.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 49a 1.ogg Lisa: Oh? Then would you like to spend some time with me, darling? That would be wonderful.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 50.ogg Lisa: I plan to spend the next few days visiting around Sumeru City. At the end of my stay, I'll leave from Gandharva Ville and return to Mondstadt via Liyue.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 51.ogg Lisa: Who knows, perhaps we'll bump into each other again in Sumeru City or Gandharva Ville.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 52.ogg Lisa: Hmm, come to think of it, there's something romantic about such a chance encounter like this. It's like icing on the cake for this little vacation of mine.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 lisa 53.ogg Lisa: If you see me around, be sure to come and say hello, otherwise I might start feeling lonely, hehe.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh, that's Gafoor. He's the one we're searching for, but he seems to be busy talking with someone else. Maybe we should wait for them to finish.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hold on... That's Lisa! The librarian Lisa! Our Lisa!
Media:vo lxeq001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Paimon heard that Lisa had studied at the Akademiya before, but that was a long time ago. What's Lisa doing here now?
Media:vo lxeq001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wow, so Lisa used to be a Spantamad researcher? Paimon's never heard her mention it before.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hello, Lisa!
Media:vo lxeq001 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Uh well, actually, we're here to participate in a research project on Ley Lines for Spantamad! We just finished registering with Effendi.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Right, Effendi told us a research project is looking for paid volunteers. That's what we came to see Gafoor about.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: We've seen our fair share of combat since leaving Mondstadt! Exploring a Domain is like a walk in the park to us!
Media:vo lxeq001 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Mm-hmm, so there's nothing to worry about.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: By the way, Lisa, what brought you to Sumeru? Are the Knights okay with you being gone?
Media:vo lxeq001 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: So that's why you came to Sumeru, right? To walk around and meet with your old friends and teachers.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Hmm... sounds like you've experienced a lot.
Media:vo lxeq001 2 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Ohhhh, Lisa chose to be a librarian because she doesn't want to deal with hassles all the time!
Media:vo lxeq001 3 gafoor 01.ogg Gafoor: There you are! Looks like you two are ready.
Media:vo lxeq001 3 gafoor 02.ogg Gafoor: Very well. Let me inform you of some details.
Media:vo lxeq001 3 gafoor 03.ogg Gafoor: Spantamad has been involved with the Ley Lines for a long time, and it's imperative that their current is constantly monitored. This research project was also organized to help meet this demand.
Media:vo lxeq001 3 gafoor 04.ogg Gafoor: However, because abnormal fluctuations often occur in Sumeru Domains, we must regularly send people deep into various Domains to record the situation with the Ley Lines.
Media:vo lxeq001 3 gafoor 05.ogg Gafoor: Since it's often dangerous inside the Domains, we've established a rule of only dispatching personnel with combat capabilities.
Media:vo lxeq001 3 gafoor 06.ogg Gafoor: It'll be your task to go into the Domain and record any Ley Line anomalies. However, if you encounter any danger, please prioritize your safety.
Media:vo lxeq001 3 gafoor 07.ogg Gafoor: Well, those are all the necessary details. When you're ready, you may enter the Domain.
Media:vo lxeq001 4 gafoor 01.ogg Gafoor: (I can't believe she would just pass up such a great opportunity. I really don't understand what's going through her head.)
Media:vo lxeq001 4 lisa 01.ogg Lisa: (It's amazing how much the Traveler has grown. I wonder what the future holds in store...)
You tell Lisa about all that's happened after coming to Sumeru.
