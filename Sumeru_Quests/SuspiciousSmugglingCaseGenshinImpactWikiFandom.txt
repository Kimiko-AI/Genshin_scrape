Media:vo cnlq001 1 nabil 01.ogg ???: What should I do now? *sigh* If only Cyno was still around...
Media:vo cnlq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh, excuse us, has something happened?
Media:vo cnlq001 1 nabil 02.ogg ???: Oh, I appreciate the concern, but who are you?
 We also happen to know Cyno.
Media:vo cnlq001 1 nabil 03.ogg ???: Ah, friends of Cyno! Well, I suppose it's not a secret or anything... Since you two are interested, I'll just lay it out for ya.
Media:vo cnlq001 1 nabil 04.ogg Nabil: My name is Nabil, I'm a matra in the Akademiya. A case involving the smuggling of Canned Knowledge has come to our attention recently, but unfortunately, we don't have the people to handle it at the moment.
Media:vo cnlq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? You mean the Akademiya is short on matra right now?
Media:vo cnlq001 1 nabil 05.ogg Nabil: Well, not exactly, I suppose the main problem is that the case suddenly came up after General Mahamatra Cyno left to go somewhere. It would be a real headache for us to tackle the case ourselves.
Media:vo cnlq001 1 nabil 06.ogg Nabil: Given the large scope of the issue, we talked things over internally and decided that we should find further assistance from outside the matra.
Media:vo cnlq001 1 nabil 07.ogg Nabil: If you two have some time, would you lend us your strength?
Media:vo cnlq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm, alright. Since you asked so nicely, we'll help!
 Do you have any further intel regarding this case?
Media:vo cnlq001 1 nabil 08.ogg Nabil: Yes, large amounts of Canned Knowledge from unknown origins have been appearing on the market recently. We suspect there's a secret route being used to move the capsules.
Media:vo cnlq001 1 nabil 09.ogg Nabil: According to some research, using large amounts of Canned Knowledge could lead to some serious consequences, and unfortunately, most people have yet to realize that.
Media:vo cnlq001 1 nabil 10.ogg Nabil: Rumors also have it that some particularly dangerous Canned Knowledge has made its way into the market. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, this case calls for urgent action.
Media:vo cnlq001 1 nabil 11.ogg Nabil: According to our current leads, it's highly likely that there are dealers selling Canned Knowledge outside the city even as we speak. If you two could, please help us investigate the area.
Media:vo cnlq001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: You can count on us, let's go!

Media:vo cnlq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? It's Cyno! Uh, what are you doing here?
Media:vo cnlq001 2 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Ah, it's you two. I knew I sensed a familiar presence.
Media:vo cnlq001 2 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: I'm currently in the middle of an investigation here. We'll have to chat some other time.
 So you're investigating something here, too?
 Does that mean...
Media:vo cnlq001 2 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: There's been a recent case of Canned Knowledge smuggling. It seems that the smugglers are following an elaborate and dangerous scheme. I just happened to acquire some intel which led me here.
Media:vo cnlq001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hey, whaddya know! We're also here to investigate that!
Media:vo cnlq001 2 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: I see, well the situation might be more problematic than you anticipated. I've already questioned several people, but gained very little information.
Media:vo cnlq001 2 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Long story short, I was able to learn of the secret location where the Canned Knowledge is being sold. You're welcome to accompany me if you're interested.
Media:vo cnlq001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Whoa, sounds pretty complicated... but having Cyno around will definitely make things easier.
Media:vo cnlq001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Alright, let's go round up those bad guys!

Media:vo cnlq001 3 nabil 01.ogg ???: Wait, you two! Just a moment, please!
Media:vo cnlq001 3 nabil 02.ogg ???: You're (Traveler) and Paimon, right? I thought you two looked familiar. People have been talking all about you.
Media:vo cnlq001 3 nabil 03.ogg ???: It's a pleasure to meet you. Do you have a moment? There's something I'd like to discuss with you.
 Umm, who are you?
 Have we met before?
Media:vo cnlq001 3 nabil 04.ogg Nabil: My name is Nabil. I'm a matra in the Akademiya. You're friends with Cyno, right? I've heard him mention you before.
Media:vo cnlq001 3 nabil 05.ogg Nabil: Currently, Cyno is out investigating a case involving smuggled Canned Knowledge. It's been days since we've last heard from him.
Media:vo cnlq001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh no, do you think he's in trouble?
Media:vo cnlq001 3 nabil 06.ogg Nabil: Uh, well... To be completely honest, it's pretty hard to imagine anything that could pose a threat to Cyno. But since we haven't heard from him, we're starting to suspect that the case might be more complicated than we had originally thought.
Media:vo cnlq001 3 nabil 07.ogg Nabil: Word has it that you two are brave, smart, and extremely capable adventurers. Do you think you could lend us a hand and help investigate the smuggling?
Media:vo cnlq001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Alright, since you put it that way, we'll help!
 Do you have any further intel regarding this case?
Media:vo cnlq001 3 nabil 08.ogg Nabil: Large amounts of Canned Knowledge from unknown origins have been appearing on the market recently. Cyno suspected that there's a secret route being used to move the capsules.
Media:vo cnlq001 3 nabil 09.ogg Nabil: According to some research, using large amounts of Canned Knowledge could lead to some serious consequences, and unfortunately, most people have yet to realize that.
Media:vo cnlq001 3 nabil 10.ogg Nabil: Rumors also have it that some particularly dangerous Canned Knowledge has made its way into the market. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, this case calls for urgent action.
Media:vo cnlq001 3 nabil 11.ogg Nabil: Last we heard from Cyno, he was investigating somewhere outside Sumeru City. It seems that he had found some leads at the time, but we haven't heard from him since.
Media:vo cnlq001 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Sounds like we'd better go look for him. C'mon!

Media:vo cnlq001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Cyno, there you are! We finally found you!
Media:vo cnlq001 4 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Ah, it's you two. I knew I sensed a familiar presence.
Media:vo cnlq001 4 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: But I'm very busy at the moment. We'll have to chat some other time.
 We heard about the case of smuggled Canned Knowledge.
Media:vo cnlq001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: That's right! Nabil asked us to come check on the situation.
Media:vo cnlq001 4 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: So Nabil told you about this? Hmm, divulging my location without authorization... I'll let it slide for now — this isn't the time for that.
Media:vo cnlq001 4 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: I see, well the situation might be more problematic than you anticipated. I've already questioned several people, but gained very little information.
Media:vo cnlq001 4 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: Long story short, I was able to learn of the secret location where the Canned Knowledge is being sold. You're welcome to accompany me if you're interested.
Media:vo cnlq001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Whoa, sounds pretty complicated. But having a chance to catch bad guys with Cyno, it's like we're a part of the matra!
Media:vo cnlq001 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Alright, sign us up!

Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 33.ogg Dori: I'm sure the former General Mahamatra of the Akademiya would never leave any debt unpaid. Oh, the Mora... I can see it already, loads of shiny Mora coming Dori's way!

Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 34.ogg Dori: I'm sure the General Mahamatra of the Akademiya would never leave any debt unpaid, and I can only imagine the funds he's allocated for investigations... Oh, maybe I should charge him more!
 Actually, we were mistaken.
 Are there many people trying to study the Court of Desolation?
 Canned Knowledge is becoming a problem here.
 Cyno wasn't kidding when he said intel was hard to come by.
 Do you have any further intel regarding this case?
 Do you know who is smuggling the Canned Knowledge?
 Does that mean...
 Have we met before?
 Have you encountered that kind of situation before, Cyno?
 Is selling Canned Knowledge really that lucrative?
 It's all we have to go on for the moment.
 Let's all do our best.
 Not in particular...
 Quest DescriptionYou decide to take a look around the Akademiya...
 Saw this coming...
 Seems this isn't getting us anywhere.
 Shouldn't we follow them?
 So you're investigating something here, too?
 Step DescriptionAfter listening to Nabil's account of the recent case of Canned Knowledge smuggling, you decide to go outside the city to investigate.
 Step DescriptionAlthough several people selling Canned Knowledge were caught, not much information was gained. Will Dori know anything about the Canned Knowledge?
 Step DescriptionBefore leaving for the desert, Cyno wants to get rid of the people tailing you.
 Step DescriptionYou didn't expect to meet Cyno during the investigation. Cyno seems to have some information and is preparing to arrest some suspects.
 Step DescriptionYou learned about the Court of Desolation and the desert auction from Dori. Now go to Caravan Ribat and inform Cyno of your findings.
 They must have their own reasons.
 Umm, who are you?
 We also happen to know Cyno.
 We don't know any merchants.
 We heard about the case of smuggled Canned Knowledge.
 We're here to help Cyno.
 We've also experienced a lot of sticky situations.
 What's the purpose of hosting an auction?
 Why use Canned Knowledge to distribute information?
 Yes, it should be.
 Yes, we do.
 You may have a point...
Media:vo cnlq001 1 nabil 01.ogg ???: What should I do now? *sigh* If only Cyno was still around...
Media:vo cnlq001 1 nabil 02.ogg ???: Oh, I appreciate the concern, but who are you?
Media:vo cnlq001 1 nabil 03.ogg ???: Ah, friends of Cyno! Well, I suppose it's not a secret or anything... Since you two are interested, I'll just lay it out for ya.

Media:vo cnlq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh, excuse us, has something happened?
Media:vo cnlq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? You mean the Akademiya is short on matra right now?
Media:vo cnlq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm, alright. Since you asked so nicely, we'll help!
Media:vo cnlq001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: You can count on us, let's go!
Media:vo cnlq001 10 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Is that so? Well, I can't think of a reason why I'd accept. I've heard enough, get out of my way.
Media:vo cnlq001 10 jhuba 01.ogg Jhuba: Hold it right there. Heading to the desert, are we? I would think twice if I were you.
Media:vo cnlq001 10 jhuba 02.ogg Jhuba: That doesn't matter. All you need to know is that someone wishes to inform you that it's not too late to turn back.
Media:vo cnlq001 10 jhuba 03.ogg Jhuba: Ah, you must be Cyno. I've heard a lot about you — you've got quite a reputation. But this time, you're in over your head. Unless you turn around right now, I'm afraid that even you won't return unscathed.
Media:vo cnlq001 10 jhuba 04.ogg Jhuba: And as for you two... why bother sticking your noses in trouble that doesn't even concern you, hmm?
Media:vo cnlq001 10 jhuba 05.ogg Jhuba: Heh, have you really thought it through? You're not just doing this for recognition, are you, Cyno?
Media:vo cnlq001 10 jhuba 06.ogg Jhuba: My employer said that he's willing to compromise, as long as you just walk away. He could, for example, reduce the amount of Canned Knowledge on the market. I'm sure that would help your investigation appear to be successful enough.
Media:vo cnlq001 10 jhuba 07.ogg Jhuba: On top of that, he's willing to give you a cut of the profit. So you see, you get both Mora and a boost to your reputation. I can't think of a reason why you would pass that up.
Media:vo cnlq001 10 jhuba 08.ogg Jhuba: Sorry, no can do. We're getting paid to ensure you disappear. Since you won't turn back willingly, then we're gonna have to make you go back.
Media:vo cnlq001 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? Who are you?
Media:vo cnlq001 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: That's right. We won't just sit back and do nothing!
Media:vo cnlq001 11 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: ...
Media:vo cnlq001 11 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: No need. Even if we apprehend them, there'll be little information to gain. Besides, it might also be a trap.
Media:vo cnlq001 11 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: I apologize for bringing you into this dangerous mess. Just being associated with me will inevitably cause you to become targets as well.
Media:vo cnlq001 11 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: You should be careful from now on. Sleep with one eye open.
Media:vo cnlq001 11 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: You'd be surprised. Anyway, just be careful. Mercenaries are never quick to forget. In their line of work, even a single failure is bad for reputation.
Media:vo cnlq001 11 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: They may even stay hidden in some dark corner for a very long time, waiting for the right moment to ambush you. They'll do anything to keep their prestige intact.
Media:vo cnlq001 11 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: Yes. I remember it like it was yesterday.
Media:vo cnlq001 11 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: I was carrying out a mission with one of my superiors. I didn't have much experience at the time, and I let my guard down after we had closed the case. We ended up being attacked by the remainder of the mercenaries.
Media:vo cnlq001 11 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: My superior was injured while protecting me, and we struggled to gain control of the situation. I've become more vigilant ever since, staying alert even while I sleep.
Media:vo cnlq001 11 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: He survived with a fractured wrist. It took two months for him to recover, but luckily, there weren't any further complications. Last year, he transferred to an administrative role for personal reasons, and no longer participates in live missions.
Media:vo cnlq001 11 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: His name is Taj Radkani, a very well-respected matra. You will have the chance to meet him someday.
Media:vo cnlq001 11 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: Anyway, our mission will be dangerous. I'm already used to such grueling conditions, but I don't want to see you two get hurt.
Media:vo cnlq001 11 cyno 13.ogg Cyno: Good. Don't worry, it won't be long till we're at the bottom of this.
Media:vo cnlq001 11 cyno 14.ogg Cyno: And once this is all over, I'll sweep away any other hidden dangers.
Media:vo cnlq001 11 jhuba 01.ogg Jhuba: Ugh... this doesn't change anything.
Media:vo cnlq001 11 jhuba 02.ogg Jhuba: You're in over your head, Cyno. There will be others coming for you. You'll regret it!
Media:vo cnlq001 11 jhuba 03.ogg Jhuba: Let's get outta here!
Media:vo cnlq001 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wait, hold on! There's no way anyone could sleep without closing their eyes... Uh, right?
Media:vo cnlq001 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whoa, who could have seen that coming! Was he okay?
Media:vo cnlq001 11 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Don't worry, Paimon will stay alert! We'll see danger coming a mile away!
Media:vo cnlq001 2 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Ah, it's you two. I knew I sensed a familiar presence.
Media:vo cnlq001 2 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: I'm currently in the middle of an investigation here. We'll have to chat some other time.

Media:vo cnlq001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Whoa, sounds pretty complicated. But having a chance to catch bad guys with Cyno, it's like we're a part of the matra!
Media:vo cnlq001 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Alright, sign us up!
Media:vo cnlq001 6 amainu 01.ogg Amainu: What difference does it make? If you see somethin' you like, buy it. If not, then keep walkin'.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 amainu 02.ogg Amainu: 150k. Show us the Mora, and you'll get the goods.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 amainu 03.ogg Amainu: Ah! It—It's Cyno! Ugh, when's he ever gonna let up!?
Media:vo cnlq001 6 amainu 04.ogg Amainu: But don't forget the Mora!
Media:vo cnlq001 6 amainu 05.ogg Amainu: What is this? He's got backup now? Doesn't everyone say Cyno works alone?
Media:vo cnlq001 6 amainu 06.ogg Amainu: Uh, I don't like the looks of this... Either way's gonna be a tough fight. Any ideas?
Media:vo cnlq001 6 amainu 07.ogg Amainu: He's telling the truth, honest! Normally, we should have received a shipment three days ago, but we didn't get anything.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 amainu 08.ogg Amainu: The stock we have right now is from eight days ago, which is why there isn't much left.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 amainu 09.ogg Amainu: Are you kiddin'? We've known your name since day one in this business. The boss warned us to watch out and even gave us info about you.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 amainu 10.ogg Amainu: But here we are... *sigh* I guess we never stood a chance.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 amenzu 01.ogg Amenzu: They've been cracking down on us lately, so we don't have much on hand. If you see something that catches your eye, then now's your chance. There's no telling when we'll have more.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 amenzu 02.ogg Amenzu: Hey! Forget the goods, let's split!
Media:vo cnlq001 6 amenzu 03.ogg Amenzu: It's over. It's not like we're making a big cut anyway, I'm not losing my life here.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 amenzu 04.ogg Amenzu: Well, uh, the pickup location is different every time... The boss tells us where it's gonna be and that's it. We don't get a say in it. He sends someone every five days to bring us the goods.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 amenzu 05.ogg Amenzu: I—I don't know.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Put the Mora down and your hands up.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: Just like the others I've caught. They're not deep in the circle, just dealers at the bottom of the chain.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: Alright, I have one question, and one question only: Where did you get this Canned Knowledge?
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: And when is the next batch coming?
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: I know exactly why they didn't receive their last batch. Three days ago is exactly when I started my investigation.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: I suspect whoever's running this whole thing knew that I was coming, so they cut all contact with these dealers.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: When you were trying to escape, you said something about me working alone. Where did you hear that from?
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: Hmph, they already knew all about me and were trying to avoid being detected from the very beginning.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: These small fries are the only ones they leave out in the open, and no matter how many we catch, it won't further our investigation.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: If only we had another lead... like a merchant who sells large amounts of Canned Knowledge.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: Hmm? Do you have a potential suspect? You'd better bring them to me for judgment!
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: That's right. I won't turn a blind eye on any dangerous suspect.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 13.ogg Cyno: I see. Anyway, I'll think of a way to deal with these two and then continue gathering information.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 14.ogg Cyno: If you manage to learn anything, you can find me at Caravan Ribat.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 15.ogg Cyno: And as for you, I don't ever want to catch you buying Canned Knowledge again. If you possess any unused Knowledge Capsules, then you should submit them to the authorities immediately.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 16.ogg Cyno: The Akademiya has clearly published the potential dangers of Canned Knowledge. I don't like having to repeat things, and besides, I'm sure you wouldn't listen anyway.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 17.ogg Cyno: I just hope you understand that your actions are what fuels the smuggling of Canned Knowledge.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 18.ogg Cyno: If I ever catch you again, I will personally see to it that you are punished.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 cyno 19.ogg Cyno: Alright, (Traveler), I need to go now.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 mutair 01.ogg Mutair: Is this all you got? Hmm, seems even less than last time.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 mutair 02.ogg Mutair: *sigh* What does the Akademiya think they're doing... Alright, I'll take these here. Lemme see what else you have...
Media:vo cnlq001 6 mutair 03.ogg Mutair: I don't see any real gems in this batch. It's all pretty ordinary stuff. Whatever, how much do I owe you?
Media:vo cnlq001 6 mutair 04.ogg Mutair: Okay, okay, I got it... Just keep your nose out of my business.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 mutair 05.ogg Mutair: What, you got a problem with that, too? Listen, buying Canned Knowledge is a deal between two people: the buyer and the seller. We don't need people like you butting in on our business here.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 mutair 06.ogg Mutair: Think about it. If the Akademiya is hoarding something as convenient and useful like Canned Knowledge, then they must've been planning only to use it for themselves! Am I right?
Media:vo cnlq001 6 mutair 07.ogg Mutair: Hah! Y—You think you can scare me?
Media:vo cnlq001 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Duh-dun! Not so fast! You can't escape with Paimon on the case!
Media:vo cnlq001 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh!? Did they really just give up like that?
Media:vo cnlq001 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh? Oh, you mean someone like Dor... uh, nothing...
Media:vo cnlq001 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wh—Whoa, judgment!?
Media:vo cnlq001 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh, uh, sounds like we shouldn't ever let Cyno meet Dori...
Media:vo cnlq001 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hey, what's with the attitude, mister!
Media:vo cnlq001 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Phew... (Traveler), why don't we go talk to Dori? She's got loads of connections and might be able to tell us something about all this.
Media:vo cnlq001 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: If Paimon remembers correctly, she's usually at the Palace of Alcazarzaray. Let's go!
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 01.ogg Dori: I see, I see... So that's the latest scoop! Heh, good thing you didn't rat me out. Otherwise, who knows where I'd have to be hiding to avoid attention.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 02.ogg Dori: No idea, sorry. I've already cashed out of the Canned Knowledge business.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 03.ogg Dori: That's right. With so much Canned Knowledge flooding the market, it was becoming impossible to fetch decent prices anymore.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 04.ogg Dori: Besides, it seems that group of smugglers has practically taken over the market. It's a little rule of mine to never fight for a share of someone else's market. If I'm gonna make Mora, it's gonna be the lion's share.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 05.ogg Dori: Plus, with regulations getting as tight as they are now, I figured I might as well just hang it up.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 06.ogg Dori: Well, not completely.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 07.ogg Dori: Granted, I don't know who's behind all the smuggling activity, but since you didn't sell me out, I'll let you in on what I do know.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 08.ogg Dori: After all, those smugglers have really crossed the line, butting their way into the market like that. I hope their luck runs out soon so that I can take over... Ahem, I mean, so that the industry can become more fairly regulated.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 09.ogg Dori: Hehe, don't underestimate its value. Think about it — you can gain all sorts of knowledge while bypassing the troublesome process of studying. Naturally, that makes it a product worth a high price.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 10.ogg Dori: Of course, not everyone needs that kind of knowledge, but in a market as big as Sumeru, there is plenty of demand. Plus, the cost of production is relatively low, so even if dealers have to cover transportation costs, there is still an enormous profit to be made.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 11.ogg Dori: Hehe... Being able to gain complex knowledge and become a scholar with the snap of your fingers does sound like a dream, doesn't it?
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 12.ogg Dori: But everything in this world comes at a price, right?
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 13.ogg Dori: Gaining knowledge is a complicated process — it requires learning, thinking, and practice. Even when it comes to my own business, I have to go through a lot of preparation before I put anything out for sale.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 14.ogg Dori: But with Canned Knowledge, one may simply skip all the hassle and get whatever they need to know immediately. That inherently leads to at least two potential problems...
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 15.ogg Dori: First, you'll accept the knowledge as factual without a second thought, and you will find it very hard to forget. This means that if the knowledge is flawed, then it'll be very difficult to correct.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 16.ogg Dori: And second, excess use of Knowledge Capsules over an extended time diminishes your ability to think. You'll end up becoming like a library that can only store knowledge.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 17.ogg Dori: Of course, using it sparingly is not an issue, which is exactly why I used to sell it.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 18.ogg Dori: It's just like how medicine can be used to cure diseases, but can also do harm when overused. It all comes down to balancing the right amount.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 19.ogg Dori: Ahem, anyway back to the point, there'll be consequences if the sale of Canned Knowledge by those smugglers is left unchecked.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 20.ogg Dori: And what's worse, you're playing right into their hands by focusing only on the Canned Knowledge that's made its way into the market.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 21.ogg Dori: As far as I know, their real purpose is to distribute information about the Court of Desolation. That's where the real business opportunity is.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 22.ogg Dori: Rumor has it that it's a site of ruins from the age of King Deshret. It's said that with the treasures inside, one can see beyond life and death, but any research of the ruins is strictly banned by the Akademiya.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 23.ogg Dori: Word on the street is that there'll be an auction taking place in the desert. They're auctioning rare Canned Knowledge, some of which is related to the Court of Desolation.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 24.ogg Dori: Once I heard about the auction, I began to suspect that all the Canned Knowledge popping up on the market is just a diversion. I'd wager that their real target is the Court of Desolation.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 25.ogg Dori: Because studying those ruins is not just a simple matter — it requires knowledge spanning several fields. So if they're aiming to quickly assemble a research team, Canned Knowledge would be the best solution.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 26.ogg Dori: As for the auction, chances are they're trying to attract and scout out anyone with interest or expertise on the subject.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 27.ogg Dori: On the other hand, no one can say for sure that they will ever succeed in finding the Court of Desolation. So they might as well just make a fortune while they're at it by hyping up the related Canned Knowledge at the auction.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 28.ogg Dori: That's right! And now that I've shared all that valuable info with you, it's time to introduce our Limited Edition Desert Travel Kit! It comes complete with a map straight to the auction location.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 29.ogg Dori: As I said, I also have to make preparations before I sell things, right? Now let me consider how much I should sell this for...
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 30.ogg Dori: I've got it! 500,000 Mora per kit! It's quite the bargain. We'll even offer a 50% discount for little Paimon's travel kit. Only 250,000 Mora!
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 31.ogg Dori: No need to worry, little one. Cyno's the one heading this investigation, isn't he? I'll be sure to bill all the expenses to him.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 32.ogg Dori: All you'll need to do is tell him to go the merchant's guild and pay the bill once the mission is completed. Just, uh... be sure to not send him directly here though, okay? That would leave me completely in the open.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 33.ogg Dori: I'm sure the former General Mahamatra of the Akademiya would never leave any debt unpaid. Oh, the Mora... I can see it already, loads of shiny Mora coming Dori's way!
Media:vo cnlq001 7 dori 34.ogg Dori: I'm sure the General Mahamatra of the Akademiya would never leave any debt unpaid, and I can only imagine the funds he's allocated for investigations... Oh, maybe I should charge him more!
Media:vo cnlq001 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh!? You mean you stopped selling it?
Media:vo cnlq001 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Aw, sounds like we came all this way for nothing...
Media:vo cnlq001 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hey, you just want to make more business for yourself!
Media:vo cnlq001 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Then why does the Akademiya prohibit selling Canned Knowledge?
Media:vo cnlq001 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Whoa, that does sound pretty dangerous! (Traveler), you used Canned Knowledge before. Did you feel any negative effects?
Media:vo cnlq001 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: The Court of Desolation? What's that?
Media:vo cnlq001 7 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Hmmm... sounds to Paimon like we better head to the desert and see the auction. Who knows, we might find some leads there.
Media:vo cnlq001 7 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: What! That's super expensive!
Media:vo cnlq001 7 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: (Traveler), we'd better get going. If Dori keeps at it, we'll be out of Mora!
Media:vo cnlq001 9 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: The Court of Desolation...
Media:vo cnlq001 9 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: I won't ask how you came by this intel, but is it reliable?
Media:vo cnlq001 9 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: Partially. It was a secret place built by a dark sect from the age of King Deshret. The ruins do contain treasures, but the place is also rife with unknown dangers.
Media:vo cnlq001 9 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: According to past research, one must forfeit their life as the price of entering. They are not some ordinary ruins, so the Akademiya has strictly prohibited any related research.
Media:vo cnlq001 9 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: However, if they are using the Canned Knowledge as a way to move information and recruit researchers, then I suppose your conclusion does hold some validity. Regardless, we need to go into the desert.
Media:vo cnlq001 9 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: Less in recent years, but there are always those who attempt to do so, both inside and outside the Akademiya.
Media:vo cnlq001 9 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: After all, legends claim that whoever obtains the treasures inside can see beyond life and death, or even resurrect the dead.
Media:vo cnlq001 9 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: Death is often the greatest grievance for many people. Though they're fully aware that the chances of these rumors being true are slim, they hold tight to such fantasies and pursue them regardless...
Media:vo cnlq001 9 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: That's why some continue to research it, regardless of it being a restricted subject. On top of that, it's hard to track the source of information contained in Canned Knowledge.
Media:vo cnlq001 9 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: Do you know where the auction is taking place?
Media:vo cnlq001 9 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: Good. We'll go investigate. But before that, we'll have to get rid of these people tailing us.
Media:vo cnlq001 9 cyno 12.ogg Cyno: That's right. Let's begin to leave town and see what happens. I'm sure they'll reveal themselves as soon as we make a move.
Media:vo cnlq001 9 cyno 13.ogg Cyno: Don't worry. I'll make short work of them.
Media:vo cnlq001 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Cyno! We've got news for you! What the smugglers are really after is a chance to research the Court of Desolation!
Media:vo cnlq001 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: They are hosting an auction in the desert to sell Canned Knowledge about those ruins!
Media:vo cnlq001 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We also heard that the Court of Desolation contains treasures from the time of King Deshret. Is that true?
Media:vo cnlq001 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? People tailing us?
Media:vo cnlq001 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: That's Cyno for ya... but we can lend a hand too, you know!
Media:vo dialog cnlq001 dori 01.ogg Dori: By the way, it would be quite a tricky task to get all the Canned Knowledge off the market, don't you think? You'd probably be making some enemies along the way, too.
Media:vo dialog cnlq001 dori 02.ogg Dori: Because in the short run, the circulation of Canned Knowledge benefits everyone.
Media:vo dialog cnlq001 dori 03.ogg Dori: Whoever is behind the smuggling gets a chance to study the Court of Desolation, while knowledge dealers stand to make big profits. Even the buyers get a rare chance to easily access knowledge that is hard to come by.
Media:vo dialog cnlq001 dori 04.ogg Dori: So you see, it's a win for everyone. Who would want anyone stepping in and ruining the deal, hmm?
Media:vo dialog cnlq001 dori 05.ogg Dori: As for the long-term consequences that lie ahead... Most people can't see them, nor would they even believe them. So if you think about it, you're setting yourself up to be targeted by everyone.
Media:vo dialog cnlq001 dori 06.ogg Dori: You've got quite the challenge ahead of you. I can only imagine how stressed you'll feel... How about I recommend a book for you? It's called One Hundred Ways to De-Stress and Live Your Best! I'll offer you a 30% discount right now!
Media:vo dialog cnlq001 nabil 01.ogg Nabil: How's the case coming? Any progress?
Media:vo dialog cnlq001 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? What makes you say that?
Media:vo dialog cnlq001 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ah! Again!? No way we're falling for that!
You tell Dori about what happened with Cyno.
