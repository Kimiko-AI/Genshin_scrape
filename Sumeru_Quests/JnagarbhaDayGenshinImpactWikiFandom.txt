(The Traveler reaches out and a sprout grows from the tree nearby)

(The barrier around Nahida disappears)
 (I don't know what I can say or do.)
 (The arrogance of the scholars...)
 (This isn't looking good...)
 (We were noticed...)
 ...Does that also include your General Mahamatra?
 ...Maybe benefits of some kind.
 ...That's enough, Paimon.
 A Gnosis?
 Alhaitham, you...
(Azar examines the Knowledge Capsule)
 Busted...
 But in the end, you're still relying on a god.
 Calm down, Paimon...
 Certainly sounds like it.
 Do you remember when he rushed towards the Grand Sage?
 Don't think like that.
 Don't worry about it. You've also helped us a lot.

 How are things going outside?
 How's Nahida?
 I don't think the guards can hear us anymore.
 I guess they finished entering all the Knowledge Capsules.
 I want to confirm everything again.
 It sounds like Nilou completed her task.
 It's faint, but...I have a signal.
 It's not like Sumeru didn't already have a god of its own.
 It's not too late for you to stop.
 Keep waiting

 Let's review what we discussed during our strategy meeting.
 Let's talk.
 Marvelous.
 Nahida is awake.
 Not bad, but worse than mine.
 Preparing to connect with her consciousness now.
 Quest DescriptionThe Akademiya's Jnagarbha Day has finally come. All your plans and preparations are for one purpose, and one purpose only — to save a god.
 Return to the position behind the house
 Saving Irminsul...
 Stealthily move to the right
 That all sounds amazing.
 That was close.
 That wasn't because of carelessness, but of their arrogance.
 That's why he can pull off this kind of thing...
 The Akademiya's god creation plan...
 The Fatui are not to be trusted.
 The Fatui have ulterior motives.
 The plan feels a bit unrefined.
 Then we try to connect with Nahida.
 They think the Akasha is completely under their control.
 This is knowledge that only you yourself could have discovered.

 We can relax for the time being.
 We finally meet, Nahida.
 We first need to find the place with the best signal in this room.
 We managed to rescue her!
 We must trust our friends.
 We're done here.
 We've been set up.
 What about Lesser Lord Kusanali?
 What do you mean?
 When he pretended that he had been corrupted...
 When you put things that way...
 When you say "dishonest persons"...
 Yes, just in case.
 You deserved to be freed.
 You say it's the pinnacle of human wisdom...
 You were scared out of your wits just a moment ago...
(Traveler): (But... she's right here in front of me. I can't just give up like this...)
(Traveler): (Dang it, she isn't reacting. Seems like she can't sense me...)
(Traveler): (I had already left her behind once when The Doctor first appeared. I can't do that again...)
(The Traveler remembers when Nahida, as Katheryne, held back the citizens under the influence of The Doctor)
(Traveler): (Is Nahida using this barrier to isolate her consciousness from the outside world?)
(Traveler): (Is this... a realm of consciousness?)
(Traveler): (Nahida's not moving. She really has sealed off her consciousness... I need to think of a way to wake her up.)
(Traveler): (What is this...? It looks like... some sort of barrier?)

Alhaitham: Azar!!
Alhaitham: Azar...
Alhaitham: Traitor... You, traitor...
Although Isak managed to avoid arrest, the mission failed...
Azar: Alhaitham?
Azar: Aren't you doing the exact same thing as me
Azar: Even the most rational scholar will yearn for the power of a god in a moment of desperation
Azar: Excellent. You may begin
Azar: He has gone completely insane
Azar: Hmph. How uninteresting...
Azar: I'll deal with them later
Azar: Issue the new prohibition act from the Akasha to the guards
Azar: Take him to the matra, and exile him to Aaru Village
Azar: Then, find someone to take these two to the confinement room
Azar: They'll know what to do
Azar: Unfortunately for you, no god will lend you their power
Azar: Well, what do we have here... So you stole that Divine Knowledge Capsule
Cutscene's Travel Log summary:
Azar orders the guards to surround you. Alhaitham is somehow seized by a frenzy at this dire moment. His behavior reminds you of those who have used Divine Knowledge Capsules, and you notice one such red capsule dropping from his person, which further confirms your suspicions. Alhaitham launches forward to attack Azar, but is stopped by the guards. Azar looks with sheer indifference, ordering for Alhaitham to be exiled to Aaru Village, and you, sent to the confinement room. Meanwhile, as the preparations for Jnagarbha Day have been finished, Azar's men will soon begin entering the capsules.Alhaitham gradually comes to when being escorted outside the city. He gives a knowing smile — to someone none other than Nilou, who has been waiting by the street-side.
(Alhaitham begins to enter a manic state and his Akasha Terminal turns red)
Alhaitham: Azar...
(A Divine Knowledge Capsule falls from Alhaitham)
Azar: Well, what do we have here... So you stole that Divine Knowledge Capsule
Alhaitham: Traitor... You, traitor...
Azar: Even the most rational scholar will yearn for the power of a god in a moment of desperation
Azar: Aren't you doing the exact same thing as me
Azar: Alhaitham?
Azar: Unfortunately for you, no god will lend you their power
Alhaitham: Azar!!
(Alhaitham charges past the two guards towards Azar)
(Another guard blocks him, causing him to fall onto Azar's desk)
(Alhaitham continues to struggle against the guards)
Azar: He has gone completely insane
(A guard hits him on the head with a halberd, knocking him unconscious)
Azar: Take him to the matra, and exile him to Aaru Village
Azar: Then, find someone to take these two to the confinement room
Azar: I'll deal with them later
Uday: Grand Sage, we have finished all required preparations for Jnagarbha Day
Uday: We may begin to enter the capsules now
Azar: Excellent. You may begin
(While Alhaitham is being escorted through Sumeru City, his Akasha Terminal turns green)
(As he is escorted past Nilou, he gives her a knowing smile)
(Cinematic ends)
Cutscene's Travel Log summary:
Nilou arrives at the plaza in front of the Akademiya to perform a solo dance, which attracts the attention of nearby scholars and other passers-by. Inside Azar's office, the grand sage himself has also noticed the unexpected commotion, and in response, casually orders that the new prohibition act be issued. However, out on the plaza, the guards instead receive an order to "search in the city for Lesser Lord Kusanali, who has escaped from the Sanctuary of Surasthana." Now, with guards rushing out of the Akademiya, no one will interrupt Nilou's dance. As such, she finishes her performance to thunderous applause.
(Nilou begins to dance in front of the Akademiya)
Male Scholar:[which?] I've never seen a performance like this. This is... incredible...
Female Scholar:[which?] Yeah... But I heard that public performances like these have been banned
Female Scholar: I can't believe she's doing this here...
(Inside Azar's office)
Uday: Grand Sage, there's some commotion outside...
Azar: Hmph. How uninteresting...
Azar: Issue the new prohibition act from the Akasha to the guards
Azar: They'll know what to do
(In front of the Akademiya)
Guard A: Erm... d'you think we should like, stop her...?
Guard B: Let's just watch for a little bit longer...
(The guards receive an order on their Akasha Terminals)
Akasha Terminal: Prohibition Act: All public performances in Sumeru City...
(The text begins to appear when it quickly gets replaced by other text)
Akasha Terminal: Lesser Lord Kusanali has escaped from the Sanctuary of Surasthana. Go into the city and detain her immediately...
(Nilou finishes her dance as the guards run past her)
(Nilou breathes a sigh of relief)

Media:vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: Naturally, I slept just fine. After all, a good rest should be considered part of the plan, since energy is an important resource.
Media:vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: It's crucial to dissipate any tension before we execute our plan.
Media:vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: Anyway, do you need me to go over the game plan again?
Media:vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: Our target is Grand Sage Azar's office. Everyone in the Akademiya knows that's where the Grand Sage's console is. Only they can operate it.
Media:vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: Many restricted commands and operations are executed via that console. I'm sure that console has a way to free Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Media:vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: That isn't something they could've accomplished with their scholarly talents alone. In the Sanctuary of Surasthana, there's a device of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's that she once used to isolate herself while meditating.
Media:vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: Five hundred years ago, the Grand Sage at the time modified the device so that it can no longer be controlled from the inside. They're effectively trapping one god with the power of another.
Media:vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: Don't forget, today is Jnagarbha Day, arguably the most important day to the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 10.ogg Alhaitham: The sages and core Akademiya personnel are busy loading the latest batch of research developments and legal decrees into Knowledge Capsules, so that they can be entered into the Akasha.
Media:vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 11.ogg Alhaitham: All the Darshans' researchers have their noses to the grindstone, and the Akademiya's grounds are flowing with all sorts of people. It's the perfect time for an infiltration.
Media:vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 12.ogg Alhaitham: When the Grand Sage leaves his office to supervise the entering process, that's our cue to access the console and free the Dendro Archon.
Media:vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 13.ogg Alhaitham: Well, yes. That's just the visible side of our plan, after all.
Media:vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 14.ogg Alhaitham: If precedence holds, the Akademiya should have already started preparing for Jnagarbha Day.
Media:vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 15.ogg Alhaitham: Let's go.
Media:vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 16.ogg Alhaitham: ...Yes? Were you expecting a stealthier approach?
Media:vo xmaq303 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Today is the Akademiya's Jnagarbha Day. We can finally put our plan into action!
Media:vo xmaq303 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Alhaitham should be waiting for us. Let's go to the Akademiya and find him!
Media:vo xmaq303 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ugh, not really... Paimon got too nervous thinking about today and didn't fall asleep until the sun was almost up...
Media:vo xmaq303 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: What about you, Alhaitham?
Media:vo xmaq303 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Y—You just wanna show off how calm you are!
Media:vo xmaq303 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: The only thing you're doing is being annoying!
Media:vo xmaq303 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: You know, Paimon's been thinking... What kind of technology could let the sages imprison even a god?
Media:vo xmaq303 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: So, uh, how are we gonna get to the Grand Sage's office?
Media:vo xmaq303 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Everyone should be in position. All that's left is for us to lead the charge!
Media:vo xmaq303 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Uhh... So are we just going to walk in through the front door? Or...?
Media:vo xmaq303 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Ugh, Paimon can't think of a good comeback... Alright, it's all on Alhaitham if things go south.
Media:vo xmaq303 10 farhad 01.ogg Farhad: It's okay, just focus on your performance. We'll take care of everything else.
Media:vo xmaq303 10 farhad 02.ogg Farhad: Alright, let's get back to business. Nilou, we'll be here to keep people from going to the Akademiya, so they don't interrupt your performance.
Media:vo xmaq303 10 farhad 03.ogg Farhad: Ugh, you couldn't think of anything better? *sigh* Oh well, I guess it does sound like something the Akademiya would do.
Media:vo xmaq303 10 hushang 01.ogg Hushang: Nilou! How's it going? Nervous?
Media:vo xmaq303 10 hushang 02.ogg Hushang: Heh, you sure know how to talk. Taking all the credit, even though we came here together to help out.
Media:vo xmaq303 10 hushang 03.ogg Hushang: Ooh, that sounds great! How can we say no to that?
Media:vo xmaq303 10 hushang 04.ogg Hushang: I was planning on telling them something like, "The Akademiya's been conducting a weird experiment, and some of their test subjects escaped. It's really dangerous there, so stay away!"
Media:vo xmaq303 10 hushang 05.ogg Hushang: Don't worry, it'll be a piece of cake!
Media:vo xmaq303 10 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Definitely more than usual, but it's because I'm worried I won't dance well enough.
Media:vo xmaq303 10 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: Well, thank you both! I'll have to treat you to a meal after all this ends. I really, really appreciate all of your help.
Media:vo xmaq303 10 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: Hehe, I think it sounds great. I'm counting on you guys!
Media:vo xmaq303 12 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Vihar, thank you so much for doing all of this, and even dressed up as the Knight of Flowers, no less.
Media:vo xmaq303 12 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: I'll pass on the candy, though. I cut back on sweets in the period leading up to a performance, and I'm about to start one!
Media:vo xmaq303 12 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: Yeah, thanks to you. I'm really grateful. Alright, time to hit the "stage"!
Media:vo xmaq303 12 vihar 01.ogg Vihar: Hey, Nilou. Sorry, it's great to see you, but I'm really busy right now. Our "Bait People Away with Yalda Candies" plan is working beautifully.
Media:vo xmaq303 12 vihar 02.ogg Vihar: Do you want some candy? We have more than we can give out.
Media:vo xmaq303 12 vihar 03.ogg Vihar: Haha, you have a point. The "stage" is cleared and everything's ready, so you can start your performance at any time.
Media:vo xmaq303 12 vihar 04.ogg Vihar: You're welcome. The honor's all mine, since I'll have such a great view of the show.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: ...Now that Lesser Lord Kusanali's consciousness has been forcefully sealed, the core figures of the Akademiya and their guards have started to wear their Akasha Terminals again.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: With The Doctor's technological support, they think they have nothing to fear.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: But, this is also our chance.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: I was originally asked to draft the Knowledge Capsule for the "Artistic Performances Prohibition Act" when I was still at the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: It should be on the Grand Sage's desk right now, and will be entered into the Akasha during the next Jnagarbha Day.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: I'll make an identical Knowledge Capsule, but this time, I'll "smuggle" some misleading information into it.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: We only need to find an opportunity to switch the capsules. Once it's been entered into the Akasha on Jnagarbha Day, if someone were to be seen performing in public...
Media:vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: The sages would definitely use that opportunity to announce the ban, and so the misleading information will be disseminated amongst the guards.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: People who are used to relying on the Akasha become less inquisitive, and their ability to distinguish truth from misinformation is significantly reduced... They will view everything the Akasha releases to them as the unequivocal truth.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 10.ogg Alhaitham: Do you have someone in mind?
Media:vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 11.ogg Alhaitham: Alright. After the guards in the Akademiya are gone...
Media:vo xmaq303 13 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: How despicable of them to rely on such a person.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: The Akasha will turn humans into "machines." I've seen it happen many times.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Sure sounds complicated, but it seems like if everything goes well, we'll be able to get rid of all the guards in the Akademiya without any effort...
Media:vo xmaq303 13 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: That's pretty clever. Gettin' right into their heads.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: I just have one question. Even if we manage to get the misleading info out to the guards, how can we be sure that they'll believe it?
Media:vo xmaq303 13 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: Yikes... Good thing I didn't wear it for long when I was working in Sumeru City. At first, I thought it was a good thing, too.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: By the way, this plan still requires a performer, right?
Media:vo xmaq303 13 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: Nilou of Zubayr Theater. I know her really well. We can trust her.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: I'm kinda hesitant to ask her to participate in a dangerous plan like this, but we can ask her in person.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: Then it'll be time for me and my stowaway brothers to shine.

Media:vo xmaq303 13 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yep yep! It's great that everything seems to be going well.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Come to think of it, when did Alhaitham replace the Knowledge Capsule that was about to be entered into the Akasha?
Media:vo xmaq303 13 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh, so that's when he did it!
Media:vo xmaq303 13 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Paimon was too nervous to notice.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Speaking of, didn't Alhaitham also yoink the Divine Knowledge Capsule from that mercenary leader in Port Ormos when everyone else was distracted?
Media:vo xmaq303 13 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: It's a time-tested trick of his...
Media:vo xmaq303 13 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Hmph. Why are we complimenting him? Yeah, he's smart and all, but he still makes Paimon's blood boil!
Media:vo xmaq303 13 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Let's review our plan for this stage again! It's not like we have anything else to do right now anyway, and it'll help us feel more confident.
Media:vo xmaq303 13 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Paimon remembers that Nilou's task was supposed to go a bit like this...

Media:vo xmaq303 14 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Here they come. Did you see that, Rahman? They came out from the Akademiya in droves!
Media:vo xmaq303 14 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: Heh, we couldn't do anything to 'em inside their coop, but outside the Akademiya... This is our hunting ground.
Media:vo xmaq303 14 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: We still need to eliminate the guards as soon as possible. If we give the sages enough time to realize what's happening, the plan's doomed.
Media:vo xmaq303 14 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: Speaking of which, most of the guards who report directly to the six sages belong to the Corps of Thirty, but they have a completely different reputation.
Media:vo xmaq303 14 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: Following those blasted sages' every whim, throwing away all the principles of being a mercenary... As someone in the same profession, I'm obligated to teach them a good lesson today.
Media:vo xmaq303 14 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: Alright, let's each take a road and herd those scattered guards back into one place. Make sure to attract their attention. Isak will be the key.
Media:vo xmaq303 14 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: It'll be fine. Isak was so determined to help, so let's put our faith in him.
Media:vo xmaq303 14 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: Besides, even if he's caught, the guards would be too scared to do anything to him... They've never seen Lesser Lord Kusanali in person, after all.
Media:vo xmaq303 14 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: Good luck.
Media:vo xmaq303 14 rahman 01.ogg Rahman: After laying low in the city for so long, this is the moment we've been waiting for. My brothers have already sprung into action.
Media:vo xmaq303 14 rahman 02.ogg Rahman: With a lioness like you, the prey sure won't be able to run far, haha.
Media:vo xmaq303 14 rahman 03.ogg Rahman: Eh, all they've done is to sit on their cushy salaries and twiddle their thumbs all day while we fought and struggled every day in the desert. The only advantage they might have is their numbers.
Media:vo xmaq303 14 rahman 04.ogg Rahman: Indeed. The "trap" has been set. All we need to do is lead them there.
Media:vo xmaq303 14 rahman 05.ogg Rahman: You gave such an important task to that child... Will he be okay?
Media:vo xmaq303 14 rahman 06.ogg Rahman: You've got a point. Anyway, I think I see them coming. Let's head out.
Media:vo xmaq303 15 anusiyaguarda 01.ogg Akademiya Guard: Hey... Why's your team here? Didn't we say to split up our search?
Media:vo xmaq303 15 anusiyaguardcaptain 01.ogg Akademiya Guard Captain: ...Where did she go? How did she disappear? Did we lose her? Hurry up and find her!
Media:vo xmaq303 15 anusiyaguardcaptain 02.ogg Akademiya Guard Captain: Who are you!? Did you set us up...? What are you planning?
Media:vo xmaq303 15 anusiyaguardcaptain 03.ogg Akademiya Guard Captain: Little brat... So you're not actually Lesser Lord Kusanali? Who exactly are you all? Eremites from the desert?
Media:vo xmaq303 15 anusiyaguardcaptain 04.ogg Akademiya Guard Captain: An ambush! How's that possible? This is Sumeru City, but mercenaries from the desert somehow ambushed us!?
Media:vo xmaq303 15 anusiyasoldier 01.ogg Akademiya Guard: Hurry, hurry! Eh? This place is... Why are you all here?
Media:vo xmaq303 15 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Just some colleagues. Think of this as a business competition or a personal grudge...
Media:vo xmaq303 15 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: After stepping into our trap, stop thinking of yourselves as "hunters." Behave like the "prey" you are.
Media:vo xmaq303 15 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Tsk, you've spent all your time hiding away in the Akademiya. This place has long since become our hunting ground. Brace yourselves!
Media:vo xmaq303 15 isak 01.ogg Isak: *pant* Whew, that was rough. I almost got caught!
Media:vo xmaq303 15 rahman 01.ogg Rahman: Yeah, isn't it one heck of a coincidence? Everybody's here... What on earth is going on?
Media:vo xmaq303 15 rahman 02.ogg Rahman: I suppose that's all of you?
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 01.ogg Azar: Hmm... This is odd...
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 02.ogg Azar: The Akademiya has quieted down after the conclusion of the Jnagarbha Day ceremonies, but it's much quieter than usual.
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 03.ogg Azar: Where are the guards? Why have I not seen a single one...? Guards? Guards!
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 04.ogg Azar: I called for the guards. Why did you come?
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 05.ogg Azar: Arrest? Who is there to arrest...?
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 06.ogg Azar: (I have an ominous feeling...)
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 07.ogg Azar: Lesser Lord Kusanali? You mean she has disappeared?
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 08.ogg Azar: (What happened? Just what is going on?)
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 09.ogg Azar: (Lesser Lord Kusanali somehow escaped? Was it Alhaitham and his party that freed her?)
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 10.ogg Azar: (That's impossible... The Akademiya is heavily guarded today, and any order to release Lesser Lord Kusanali would be strictly confidential. Besides, Alhaitham and the Traveler are already in our hands...)
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 11.ogg Azar: (What manner of trickery did they employ? How could Lesser Lord Kusanali disappear into thin air...?)
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 12.ogg Azar: (Disappear... Wait...)
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 13.ogg Azar: How was the arrest order distributed to the guards?
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 14.ogg Azar: ...Let me check.
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 15.ogg Azar: ...Ah, here.
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 16.ogg Azar: "Lesser Lord Kusanali has escaped from the Sanctuary of Surasthana. Go to the city and arrest the escapee immediately..."
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 17.ogg Azar: (The Akasha indeed contains this information, and it clearly appeared in my mind.)
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 18.ogg Azar: (...How did they bypass my permissions to issue this kind of message?)
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 19.ogg Azar: (Was it the report about the Traveler that Alhaitham submitted?)
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 20.ogg Azar: (No, I specifically checked that Knowledge Capsule before entering it into the Akasha... Could that have been... a red herring?)
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 21.ogg Azar: (Well, even if I figure it out now, it won't make any difference. The important thing now is to confirm Lesser Lord Kusanali's status...)
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 22.ogg Azar: Have you been to the Sanctuary of Surasthana to confirm that Lesser Lord Kusanali has indeed escaped?
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 23.ogg Azar: In the beginning, it was I who asked you to believe in the Akasha, to believe in the legacy left by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata... Are you trying to use my words against me?
Media:vo xmaq303 16 azar 24.ogg Azar: Hmph... Stay here and see if there are any suspicious people around... I'll go to the Sanctuary of Surasthana on my own.
Media:vo xmaq303 16 uday 01.ogg Uday: Grand Sage, how may I be of assistance?
Media:vo xmaq303 16 uday 02.ogg Uday: Ah... M—My apologies, Grand Sage.
Media:vo xmaq303 16 uday 03.ogg Uday: Right now, all Akademiya guards have entered the city to perform the ordered arrest. I thought you knew...
Media:vo xmaq303 16 uday 04.ogg Uday: A—Arrest Lesser Lord Kusanali, right? Is that not what the order was?
Media:vo xmaq303 16 uday 05.ogg Uday: Ah, yes. I wouldn't dare make up something like that...
Media:vo xmaq303 16 uday 06.ogg Uday: Right now, everyone is in a panic, and many are saying that... that Lesser Lord Kusanali will take revenge on us...
Media:vo xmaq303 16 uday 07.ogg Uday: It was issued by the Akasha earlier today. Only you have the authority to send messages like that, so I thought it was your order...
Media:vo xmaq303 16 uday 08.ogg Uday: Confirm? No, I—I haven't...
Media:vo xmaq303 16 uday 09.ogg Uday: I—It may be a bit offensive to say this, but... Grand Sage, what you're saying doesn't make any sense...
Media:vo xmaq303 16 uday 10.ogg Uday: How can the information in the Akasha be inaccurate...? What the Akasha decrees is fact — that is common knowledge to all of us...
Media:vo xmaq303 16 uday 11.ogg Uday: If we have to confirm the information and knowledge from the Akasha ourselves...
Media:vo xmaq303 16 uday 12.ogg Uday: Then how is that any different from us learning that information ourselves? Wouldn't Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's legacy lose its meaning that way...?
Media:vo xmaq303 16 uday 13.ogg Uday: N—No! Grand Sage, I'm merely confused because I believe in you. I never meant to refute you...
Media:vo xmaq303 16 uday 14.ogg Uday: Yes, Grand Sage...
Media:vo xmaq303 17 azar 01.ogg Azar: ("Lesser Lord Kusanali has escaped from the Sanctuary of Surasthana. Go to the city and arrest the escapee immediately...")
Media:vo xmaq303 17 azar 02.ogg Azar: (How can that be...? Stop thinking about it, stop... It must be a trick of theirs. As long as I personally confirm it...)
Media:vo xmaq303 17 azar 03.ogg Azar: Ah...
(From Azar's perspective, Nahida's cage appears to be empty)
Media:vo xmaq303 17 azar 04.ogg Azar: ...Impossible. That's impossible. There must be something wrong with my eyes...
Media:vo xmaq303 17 azar 05.ogg Azar: ...
Media:vo xmaq303 17 azar 06.ogg Azar: Eh? She really appeared again... What is the meaning of this...?
(From Azar's perspective, Nahida slowly appears)
Media:vo xmaq303 17 azar 07.ogg Azar: ...!
Media:vo xmaq303 17 azar 08.ogg Azar: Cyno... Have you been waiting for a chance like this?
Media:vo xmaq303 17 azar 09.ogg Azar: The Akasha predicted that you would return to the Akademiya to confront me, but I didn't expect it to turn out like this. I was careless.
Media:vo xmaq303 17 azar 10.ogg Azar: I truly did not expect a proud person like you to cooperate with Alhaitham and the Traveler...
Media:vo xmaq303 17 azar 11.ogg Azar: Hmph, then tell me, what have you found during your investigation?
Media:vo xmaq303 17 azar 12.ogg Azar: So what? Did you do all of this so I would plead guilty in front of you, General Mahamatra?
Media:vo xmaq303 17 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: What a comical sight, Azar.
Media:vo xmaq303 17 cyno 02.ogg Cyno: Once the Akasha has put certain thoughts into your head, even the Grand Sage can no longer see what's right in front of him.
Media:vo xmaq303 17 cyno 03.ogg Cyno: You all can only see the world in your mind, the one you think you know.
Media:vo xmaq303 17 cyno 04.ogg Cyno: And precisely because of this, you disregarded Lesser Lord Kusanali's existence...
Media:vo xmaq303 17 cyno 05.ogg Cyno: She has been a wise and worthy archon.
Media:vo xmaq303 17 cyno 06.ogg Cyno: No, you were blinded. Your faults stem from your reliance on the Akasha. You're still the same as always.
Media:vo xmaq303 17 cyno 07.ogg Cyno: People change, Azar. Admit it, the Akasha can't predict my actions anymore.
Media:vo xmaq303 17 cyno 08.ogg Cyno: You want to buy time? This is the Sanctuary of Surasthana. Under your own regulations, even Akademiya staff are forbidden to come here... No one will come to save you.
Media:vo xmaq303 17 cyno 09.ogg Cyno: As for the investigation... I've at least confirmed that you are guilty of insurgency against the archon, a serious crime.
Media:vo xmaq303 17 cyno 10.ogg Cyno: No. I want you to plead guilty in front of the archon herself.
Media:vo xmaq303 17 cyno 11.ogg Cyno: You once said that I had no standing to judge you. So now, how about judgment in the name of a god?
Media:vo xmaq303 18 dehya 01.ogg Dehya: Here comes your savior!
Media:vo xmaq303 18 dehya 02.ogg Dehya: You two really owe me some big thanks. I had to search through who knows how many guards to find the key here... It felt even more tiring than whacking 'em! I'm exhausted.
Media:vo xmaq303 18 dehya 03.ogg Dehya: Uh... No, no, that's... Er, I'll pass.
Media:vo xmaq303 18 dehya 04.ogg Dehya: Ugh, now isn't the time to talk about being ticklish...
Media:vo xmaq303 18 dehya 05.ogg Dehya: Things in the city and on Cyno's side are both going well. The guards that stormed out of the Akademiya are all taken care of.
Media:vo xmaq303 18 dehya 06.ogg Dehya: The Corps of Thirty is in charge of the city's defenses, but we already talked to Asfand. They've been fed up with the sages bossing them around.
Media:vo xmaq303 18 dehya 07.ogg Dehya: As long as it doesn't break their employment contracts, they'll turn a blind eye.
Media:vo xmaq303 18 dehya 08.ogg Dehya: The Grand Sage is in his custody. Even I know how terrible it is to fall into Cyno's hands, so he probably does, too.
Media:vo xmaq303 18 dehya 09.ogg Dehya: Cyno forced him to release Lesser Lord Kusanali. He has no choice but to obey.
Media:vo xmaq303 18 dehya 10.ogg Dehya: So, hurry to the Sanctuary of Surasthana. Assuming nothing weird happened...
Media:vo xmaq303 18 dehya 11.ogg Dehya: ...We should've already rescued our archon.
Media:vo xmaq303 18 dehya 12.ogg Dehya: Honestly, I didn't expect our ragtag bunch to do this well. We just came together last minute to save the archon, you know?
Media:vo xmaq303 18 dehya 13.ogg Dehya: All right, you two better go. I still have to clean up some messes in the city. See you around.
Media:vo xmaq303 18 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm... How long do we have to wait? Paimon wants to know how things are going out there!
Media:vo xmaq303 18 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon hasn't heard any sounds outside for a while. Hopefully something bad didn't happen...
Media:vo xmaq303 18 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yeah, but aren't you scared that we might be locked up in here for the rest of our lives?
Media:vo xmaq303 18 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Thinking about it, at least Paimon has you. We can still chat like this...
Media:vo xmaq303 18 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: When Paimon thinks of Nahida being imprisoned alone in the Sanctuary of Surasthana, Paimon can't help but feel sorry for her...
(The gate opens)
Media:vo xmaq303 18 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Dehya! Hehe, Paimon just knew you would come to rescue us!
Media:vo xmaq303 18 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Thanks a lot. Need Paimon to rub your shoulders?
Media:vo xmaq303 18 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: What are you afraid of? Oh, are you ticklish?
Media:vo xmaq303 18 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: That's probably because you've been super great friends with them for a long time. So, how's Cyno doing?
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: Should I say "It's nice to meet you"?
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 02.ogg Nahida: This is the first time we've met in real life. Before, we've only met in dreams, consciousness, or when I was in someone else's body.
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 03.ogg Nahida: Thank you so much for coming to rescue me, but I also need to apologize...
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 04.ogg Nahida: During this time, I did some self-reflection. My sense of inferiority and yielding to the Akademiya led to all of this, and created so much trouble for you all.
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 05.ogg Nahida: Hehe... Thanks, you two.
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 06.ogg Nahida: Whew... Amazing, so this is how it feels to walk out of that cage with my own body.
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 07.ogg Nahida: It's like I just had an endlessly long dream... I can't even tell if I just woke up or was only now born into this world.
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 08.ogg Nahida: My concept of "self" has become so clear...
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 09.ogg Nahida: But now doesn't seem to be the time to indulge in this feeling.
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 10.ogg Nahida: Um, this is really embarrassing. You all just rescued an archon, and now she needs your help to save her country, and even the entire world.
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 11.ogg Nahida: There's one more thing...
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 12.ogg Nahida: For all the things the Akademiya did to me, and for all the folly it committed in the name of wisdom... As their archon, I will make them pay!
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 13.ogg Nahida: Hehe... I understand now: To be a better archon, I first need to better myself.
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 14.ogg Nahida: If you haven't even figured out how to be a caterpillar, how can you be a butterfly?
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 15.ogg Nahida: Yes, true. Hm, that reminds me, I wonder how far along the Akademiya is with their god creation plan...
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 16.ogg Nahida: We need to hurry and prevent the birth of that false god.
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 17.ogg Nahida: I need to make some preparations. Since I'm now free, I can establish a direct link to the Akasha and control it.
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 18.ogg Nahida: First things first, I need to remove the restrictions that The Doctor put on me in the Akasha...
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 19.ogg Nahida: After that, I'll make some adjustments and revoke the sages' permissions. The Akasha will then be like how it originally was: only operable by the archon.
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 20.ogg Nahida: ...After all, the Akademiya betrayed Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's trust.
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 21.ogg Nahida: This might take some time. In the meantime, you should also work on your own preparations.
Media:vo xmaq303 19 nahida 22.ogg Nahida: If we don't stop the god creation plan in time, we'll be in for a tough fight.
Media:vo xmaq303 19 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Nahida...
Media:vo xmaq303 19 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Exactly! We're here because you're a good archon and one of our friends.
Media:vo xmaq303 19 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: It's okay. With you here, Paimon's sure that everything will work out!
Media:vo xmaq303 19 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: What is it?
Media:vo xmaq303 19 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Ah...
Media:vo xmaq303 19 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Wow! That's the spirit! You're finally standing up for yourself and not letting people walk all over you!
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardb 01a 1.ogg Akademiya Guard: Huh? Did I... just see something dart by?
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardb 01a 2.ogg Akademiya Guard: I'd better go have a look...
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardb 01a 3.ogg Akademiya Guard: Were my eyes playing tricks on me...?
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardb 01a 4.ogg Akademiya Guard: I should go check to see if someone's hiding over there.
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardb 01a 5.ogg Akademiya Guard: Hey! Stop, I saw you! Don't try to run!
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardb 01a 6.ogg Akademiya Guard: There seems to be nothing here. Just to be safe, I should look around.
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardb 01a 8.ogg Akademiya Guard: What, Lesser Lord Kusanali? How did I not see anything just now!
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardc 01b 1.ogg Akademiya Guard: Hmm... Let's have a look behind the house...
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardc 01b 3.ogg Akademiya Guard: Hmm, looks like nothing's here. What a waste of time.
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardc 02a 1.ogg Akademiya Guard: Doesn't seem like anything unusual's around here...
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardc 02b 1.ogg Akademiya Guard: Hey! Stop, I saw you! Don't try to run!
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardc 02b 2.ogg Akademiya Guard: What, Lesser Lord Kusanali? How did I not notice that!
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardcaptain 01a 1.ogg Akademiya Guard Captain: Hey! Lesser Lord Kusanali is over there. Stop!
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardcaptain 01b 1.ogg Akademiya Guard Captain: The target, suspected to be Lesser Lord Kusanali, has escaped into the Grand Bazaar. Assemble and arrest her!
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardcaptain 01c 1.ogg Akademiya Guard Captain: Hey! Lesser Lord Kusanali is over there. Stop!
Media:vo xmaq303 20 anusiyaguardcaptain 01d 1.ogg Akademiya Guard Captain: The target, suspected to be Lesser Lord Kusanali, has escaped into the Grand Bazaar. Assemble and arrest her!
Media:vo xmaq303 20 isak 01.ogg Isak: Hmm, this outfit...
Media:vo xmaq303 20 isak 02.ogg Isak: Oh yeah... I remember, of course I do. I'm just a little nervous...
Media:vo xmaq303 20 isak 03.ogg Isak: Okay, got it. I'm here to pay back Lesser Lord Kusanali for helping Grandpa. I won't get cold feet!
Media:vo xmaq303 20 isak 04.ogg Isak: (Why is there a guard over there? Did he already run ahead of me?)
Media:vo xmaq303 20 isak 05.ogg Isak: (This is different from our plan, but there's no time. I need to make a choice...)
Media:vo xmaq303 20 isak 06a 1.ogg Isak: (Good thing they didn't find me. That was close... I'd better hurry and keep going.)
Media:vo xmaq303 20 isak 06a 2.ogg Isak: (Oh no, they found me! Where should I go?)
Media:vo xmaq303 20 isak 07b 1.ogg Isak: (What should I do next?)
Media:vo xmaq303 20 isak 07b 2.ogg Isak: (Luckily he didn't check behind the tree. What should I do next?)
Media:vo xmaq303 20 isak 07b 3.ogg Isak: (The guard looks alert. What should I do next?)
Media:vo xmaq303 20 isak 07c 1.ogg Isak: (How is this possible? There are also Akademiya guards here... Oh no...)
Media:vo xmaq303 20 isak 08b 1.ogg Isak: (Looks like the guard finally left. I needa go.)
Media:vo xmaq303 20 isak 08b 2.ogg Isak: (Ack, they found me! This is bad... Where should I go?)
Media:vo xmaq303 20 isak 09a 1.ogg Isak: (How is this possible? There is also an Akademiya guard here... Oh no...)
Media:vo xmaq303 20 maqrin 01.ogg Maqrin: Hey, they're here! I can see the Akademiya guards!
Media:vo xmaq303 20 tanina 01.ogg Tanina: Hey, do you remember what you need to do, Isak? When the guards get here, you'll pretend to be Lesser Lord Kusanali and run away from them.
Media:vo xmaq303 20 tanina 02.ogg Tanina: Relax. Don't think about getting caught. Even if that happens, we won't leave you behind.
Media:vo xmaq303 20 tanina 03.ogg Tanina: You only need to think about getting the guards' attention and leading them to the Grand Bazaar. Leave the rest to us.
Media:vo xmaq303 20 tanina 04.ogg Tanina: All right! It's time, Isak. Take a deep breath... and go! You can do this!

Media:vo xmaq303 21 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: Indeed. Known as the House of Daena, it is quite possibly the most extensive special collections library in Teyvat.
Media:vo xmaq303 21 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: The Akademiya marches to a fast beat, especially since it's Jnagarbha Day. They're all occupied with their own matters.
Media:vo xmaq303 21 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: Just act natural. Now, hurry along.
Media:vo xmaq303 21 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Is this the Akademiya's library?
Media:vo xmaq303 21 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh, there are a lot of students going through here... Is it really okay just to waltz right in?
Media:vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: That's me. Is something the matter? I'm in a hurry.
Media:vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: Outside guests? How did you arrive at such a conclusion? Your groundless inference shames the Haravatat Darshan.
Media:vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: That wasn't my intention. As your Haravatat senior, I just assumed that you possessed a greater aptitude for critical thinking.
Media:vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 04a.ogg Alhaitham: Look. Based on what you already know, the purpose of my return and the reason they're here should be obvious.
Media:vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: Hey, shh... Yes, you've proven yourself as the top student in Haravatat. I surmise you have arrived at the correct conclusion.
Media:vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: It's nothing. We'll be on our way, then.
Media:vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: I'm afraid I don't know either.
Media:vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: Mhm. He convinced himself of whatever truth he came up with.
Media:vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: That is the so-called "pride" of a scholar. If someone questions their academic facility, they will instantly feign understanding to keep up appearances.
Media:vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 10.ogg Alhaitham: Nowadays, the Akademiya is rampant with this type of scholar. Their obvious farces of intellect only serve to highlight themselves as fools.
Media:vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 11.ogg Alhaitham: We shouldn't waste any more time. It would be problematic if we missed our window of opportunity. Let's go.
Media:vo xmaq303 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Eh!?
Media:vo xmaq303 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What the heck just happened now...? What did he just guess?
Media:vo xmaq303 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You have no idea!?
Media:vo xmaq303 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wow, so there are special ways to deal with smart people. We don't even need to make up our own excuses...
Media:vo xmaq303 4 viraf 01.ogg Viraf: ...S—Scribe?
Media:vo xmaq303 4 viraf 02.ogg Viraf: Please wait. Are you Scribe Alhaitham?
Media:vo xmaq303 4 viraf 03.ogg Viraf: Ah, n—no, I was just surprised to see you here. I had heard that the sages were looking for you not long ago, but I didn't know what for.
Media:vo xmaq303 4 viraf 04.ogg Viraf: And, um, also... Please don't bring outside guests into the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq303 4 viraf 05.ogg Viraf: W—What did you say...? I'm the top student in Haravatat, and I earned third place at the last inter-Darshan debate. Don't look down on me!
Media:vo xmaq303 4 viraf 06.ogg Viraf: I—Is that so... Wait a moment — let me think. Don't tell me the answer!
Media:vo xmaq303 4 viraf 07.ogg Viraf: The sages' search for you... A (blond/blonde)-haired traveler... Outside guests...
Media:vo xmaq303 4 viraf 08.ogg Viraf: So, from the start... the sages weren't looking for you, but this traveler? And you were gone from the Akademiya for so long because...
Media:vo xmaq303 4 viraf 09.ogg Viraf: As I expected! Please forgive me, I wasn't thinking clearly just now. Thank you for getting me back on track.
Media:vo xmaq303 4 viraf 10.ogg Viraf: Alright. Thank you for your contributions to the Akademiya, Scribe.
(Alhaitham, the Traveler, and Paimon continue into the Akademiya)
Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: It's a lift that Akademiya personnel use to access higher floors.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 02.ogg Alhaitham: No, not right now. We can't guarantee that we won't run into the Grand Sage. Let's step back and observe for now.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: Who knows. However, if we can confirm Azar's current location, our operation will be much safer if we...
Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: Hmph...
Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 05.ogg Alhaitham: Grand Sage, I didn't expect you to care so much about me. I'm truly flattered.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 06a.ogg Alhaitham: As per your judgment, Grand Sage, they are indeed dangerous individuals...
Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: Not only are they acting against the Akademiya, but their ideologies have the potential to lead scholars astray. Looks like there really was merit in my assignment.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: Anyway, I've brought them to the Akademiya as ordered, but it took some time and trouble.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: Oh, that reminds me, here's the investigation report you had requested.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 10a.ogg Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 10b.ogg Alhaitham: It's a summary of my time spent with the Traveler. An array of information about (him/her), ready for your perusal.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 11.ogg Alhaitham: ...Lord Azar, I know what you're trying to say, but I've been following your plan this entire time. Why are you doubting me at this juncture?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 12.ogg Alhaitham: Regardless, that's only a guess. The facts are that I've brought the Traveler right before you and I gave you my report.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 13.ogg Alhaitham: ...Heh, you'll see me as a traitor regardless of what I say, no?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 14.ogg Alhaitham: Even if you impugned me, it would have little effect on you all.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 15.ogg Alhaitham: You said that I betrayed the Akademiya, but you, Azar... You've betrayed all of Sumeru, betrayed its archon!
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 01.ogg Azar: ...Allow me to offer you a hint. If you wish to know his location, look behind you.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 02.ogg Azar: Do not tell me you believed the Akademiya would not grow suspicious of you after such a prolonged absence... Scribe.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 03.ogg Azar: An eyewitness had informed me of your whereabouts, so I came to personally welcome you.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 04.ogg Azar: I'm sure, but compared to you, I am far more interested in these two unexpected guests. You are... the Traveler and Paimon, correct?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 05.ogg Azar: It's a pity that only now have I been afforded the opportunity to formally meet two of Sumeru's most esteemed guests. I do apologize for my lack of decorum.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 06.ogg Azar: Excellent, you immediately initiated discussion instead of attempting to prepare some perfunctory excuse. You clearly understand the situation at hand and have no intention of making a reckless stand.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 07.ogg Azar: The foot traffic here renders this place unsuitable for discussion. Please, follow me to my office.
(The Traveler and company are brought upstairs)
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 08.ogg Azar: Alright then, Traveler. What did you wish to discuss with me?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 09.ogg Azar: Today is Jnagarbha Day, so I still have many responsibilities to attend to. There is little time for idle chit-chat before I detain you all.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 10.ogg Azar: You seem to know quite a bit about our endeavors...
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 11.ogg Azar: If that is so, then you should be praising our great work, rather than using your trivial misgivings in a futile attempt to sway me.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 12.ogg Azar: Then tell me: What do the Fatui want from me?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 13.ogg Azar: ...Tch, worthless.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 14.ogg Azar: Those are all completely worthless. Benefits, divine power... These materialistic words do nothing but debase our great work.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 15.ogg Azar: Creating a god... Yes, we are using human wisdom to create a god!
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 16.ogg Azar: If humanity cannot attain omniscience and omnipotence, then we shall create a god to reveal them! This is the pinnacle of human wisdom.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 17.ogg Azar: We shall regain a god's guidance at long last. No longer will we flounder in the interminable void of consciousness and knowledge.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 18.ogg Azar: Even Irminsul will be freed from its plight.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 19.ogg Azar: For our nation of scholars, this is the ultimate aspiration — no cost is too great to realize it.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 20.ogg Azar: You will never understand the rapture of having a god be born within your very hands. With your degree of knowledge, you cannot even comprehend such an emotion.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 21.ogg Azar: Gods exist on a plane that far eclipses humanity's. Lesser Lord Kusanali... What can she even do?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 22.ogg Azar: Care for the people? Fend off sandstorms? Fabricate silly fairy tales? These are but child's play for the Akademiya. Does that make us equal to the gods?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 23.ogg Azar: We are a people favored by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. Though I may have personally not seen it, our forefathers bore witness to "true wisdom."
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 24.ogg Azar: The ascension of the Lesser Lord has brought nothing but bewilderment to the scholars. They all ask, "Is that truly what true wisdom is supposed to look like?"
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 25.ogg Azar: With that in mind, it is better to keep her isolated in the Sanctuary of Surasthana so our academy will not become embroiled in turmoil.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 26.ogg Azar: ...
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 27.ogg Azar: Excellent. Detailed contents with no errors... I would expect nothing less than an immaculate report from the Scribe.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 28.ogg Azar: As it is Jnagarbha Day, I'll enter the information on you into the Akasha. ...Surely, you know what that means?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 29.ogg Azar: With the Akasha's calculation prowess, all of your actions will be predicted with an accuracy of at least 98%. Furthermore, your data will be updated in real time whenever new information presents itself.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 30.ogg Azar: To put it into words you can understand... Wherever you go, you will be walking under an invisible leash. This is Sumeru's greatest penalty for dishonest persons.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 31.ogg Azar: Are you not familiar with the concept that great responsibility begets an equally great suspicion?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 32.ogg Azar: In any case, you are Sumeru's most concerning external variable. Locking you down will greatly decrease the chance of any undesirable outcomes coming to pass.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 33.ogg Azar: Despicable? Perhaps from your perspective, but... I suppose you had mentally prepared yourselves for this, no?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 34.ogg Azar: Your ploy was to "sacrifice" the Traveler here, was it not?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 35.ogg Azar: Hmph, must I delineate your entire plan? Very well, I will spell things out.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 36.ogg Azar: First off, I received an eyewitness report that you were spotted with the Traveler at Caravan Ribat. However, you immediately departed for the desert and escaped surveillance range.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 37.ogg Azar: Judging by the time, you all likely encountered the truant General Mahamatra in the desert... Am I correct?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 38.ogg Azar: The Akademiya had not received correspondence from its Scribe for a prolonged time. You were also in the company of the Traveler, a close associate of Lesser Lord Kusanali, and General Mahamatra Cyno, who had defected from the Akademiya.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 39.ogg Azar: With their instigation, what was the probability that you would betray the Akademiya? Rationally speaking... 50%? 70%? What do you think?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 40.ogg Azar: Indeed, your boldness deserves praise. To think that despite status as an outlander, the Traveler is still willing to sacrifice for the sake of your plan...
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 41.ogg Azar: If I'm correct, you have a contingency plan to save Lesser Lord Kusanali and ruin our great work...
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 42.ogg Azar: Sneak into the Akademiya on Jnagarbha Day using Alhaitham's status as the Scribe, for there is a good chance that an opportunity to save the Lesser Lord will arise.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 43.ogg Azar: Should your intentions be discovered, Alhaitham will "turn traitor" and sacrifice the Traveler, thus proving his innocence. He can then stay inside the Akademiya and continue searching for a way to proceed forward.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 44.ogg Azar: As for Cyno... According to the Akasha's calculations, he will soon return to the Akademiya and confront me in person. I suppose this is also a part of your plan?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 45.ogg Azar: You misunderstand. Losing our Scribe would irreparably damage the Akademiya's regular operations and the development of Sumeru's future academic systems...
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 46.ogg Azar: However, under the current circumstances... Even that is trivial compared to what we stand to gain from our great work.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 azar 47.ogg Azar: Hmph, so flight has turned to fight at long last. Guards!
Media:vo xmaq303 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What's this platform for?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Are we gonna take it, then? The Grand Sage's office is up there somewhere.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You think the Grand Sage will exit from there?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: And after he does, we'd sneak past him...? Paimon thinks that's really dangerous...
Media:vo xmaq303 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Aah, y—you're... What's Grand Sage Azar doing here!?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: This place is crawling with guards... There's no way out for us...
Media:vo xmaq303 5 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Trivial...?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: What a pathetic justification! Do you really think that only the super smart or powerful should be able to call themselves gods?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Alhaitham...? Are you talking about us?
Media:vo xmaq303 5 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Alhaitham, so you're... You're still on the Akademiya's side!
Media:vo xmaq303 5 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: We finally started to trust you...
Media:vo xmaq303 5 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: ...We'll be monitored, just like Cyno.
Media:vo xmaq303 5 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: You're despicable!
Media:vo xmaq303 5 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Ah...
Media:vo xmaq303 5 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Ugh, maybe Paimon shouldn't have mentioned Cyno just now...
Media:vo xmaq303 6 alhaitham 01.ogg Alhaitham: ...Apart from that, we still have yet another goal in the first stage of our operation, which is to send (Traveler) to the confinement room.
Media:vo xmaq303 6 alhaitham 02a.ogg Media:vo xmaq303 6 alhaitham 02b.ogg Alhaitham: (Traveler)'s always been the person the sages are most afraid of, as well as the greatest obstacle to the successful implementation of their plan. They are very aware of the risk (he/she) poses to them.
Media:vo xmaq303 6 alhaitham 03.ogg Alhaitham: Once (Traveler) is imprisoned, the sages will likely think that everything is under control...
Media:vo xmaq303 6 alhaitham 04.ogg Alhaitham: And with their guard down, the next phase of our plan will have a much higher chance of success.
Media:vo xmaq303 6 alhaitham 05a.ogg Media:vo xmaq303 6 alhaitham 05b.ogg Alhaitham: That isn't the only reason, of course. (Traveler) has a more important task once (he/she)'s in confinement.
Media:vo xmaq303 6 alhaitham 06.ogg Alhaitham: According to the Akademiya scholars in Rahman's custody, Lesser Lord Kusanali has sealed off her consciousness in the Akasha ever since she was captured by The Doctor.
Media:vo xmaq303 6 alhaitham 07.ogg Alhaitham: That way, they can't pry any more information from her.
Media:vo xmaq303 6 alhaitham 08.ogg Alhaitham: Even if we break into the Sanctuary of Surasthana, it will take time to awaken Lesser Lord Kusanali's consciousness — we need to do that in advance.
Media:vo xmaq303 6 alhaitham 09.ogg Alhaitham: The confinement room is inside the Akademiya, close to the Sanctuary of Surasthana. It's a completely enclosed space, and you won't be receiving any visitors.
Media:vo xmaq303 6 alhaitham 10.ogg Alhaitham: I'll work with Rahman's scholars to make some modifications to your Akasha Terminal. Once you're in, get as close as you can to Lesser Lord Kusanali and try to connect to her consciousness.
Media:vo xmaq303 6 alhaitham 11.ogg Alhaitham: However, as for whether she'll actually wake up... That will depend on our luck.
(Flashback ends)
Media:vo xmaq303 6 cyno 01.ogg Cyno: Hmph, I can already see the pompous looks on their faces.
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Aargh, don't lock us up! Let us out!
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Waaah!
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh yeah, hehe... Paimon got a bit carried away there. How was Paimon's acting just now? Great, huh?
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hehe, everything's going according to plan so far! We made it into confinement, and Alhaitham's probably done with his part, too.
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: We even managed to trick Grand Sage Azar. Alhaitham sure knows how to cook up a plan.
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: What are we doing next? Paimon has trouble remembering things when she's worked up...
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Right right~! Paimon thinks it went something like this...
(A flashback begins)
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 08a.ogg Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 08b.ogg Paimon: What!? Why do we want to get (Traveler) locked up on purpose?
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Oh, that's a super tricky plan. But, Paimon still thinks it's not really worth it...
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: So our job is to wake up Nahida! Okay, totally worth getting thrown in jail for.
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Oh~ No wonder you've been wearing your Akasha Terminal today. It's the one that Alhaitham modified.
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Paimon thought they'd take our Akasha Terminals when they locked us up in here. Hmm, were they being careless?
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Alright, so what now?
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Sounds easy enough. We can finally talk with Nahida after all this time... Let's do it!
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: There's a light flashing on your Akasha Terminal. It's almost like... the faster it blinks, the better the signal.
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Whoa, it's Mora! Ooh, Mora... No Paimon, we're not here to hunt for treasure!
Media:vo xmaq303 6 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Here? Hmm, no signal again. Is it getting jammed?
Media:vo xmaq303 7 hero 01.ogg Media:vo xmaq303 7 heroine 01.ogg (Traveler): Nahida!
Media:vo xmaq303 7 hero 02.ogg Media:vo xmaq303 7 heroine 02.ogg (Traveler): Hey, Nahida!
Media:vo xmaq303 7 hero 03.ogg Media:vo xmaq303 7 heroine 03.ogg (Traveler): Nahida!!!
Media:vo xmaq303 7 hero 04.ogg Media:vo xmaq303 7 heroine 04.ogg (Traveler): Nahida!!!
(The Traveler begins to use Palm Vortex on the barrier)
Media:vo xmaq303 7 hero 05.ogg Media:vo xmaq303 7 heroine 05.ogg (Traveler): Nahida!!!
(The barrier breaks)
Media:vo xmaq303 7 hero 06.ogg Media:vo xmaq303 7 heroine 06.ogg (Traveler): Nahida?
Media:vo xmaq303 7 hero 07.ogg Media:vo xmaq303 7 heroine 07.ogg (Traveler): We're here to rescue you... Are you all right?
Media:vo xmaq303 7 hero 08.ogg Media:vo xmaq303 7 heroine 08.ogg (Traveler): ...
Media:vo xmaq303 7 hero 09.ogg Media:vo xmaq303 7 heroine 09.ogg (Traveler): ...You should've been angry ages ago.
(The Traveler awakes from the realm of consciousness)
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 01.ogg Nahida: ...When did it first start?
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 02.ogg ...Oh, right. It started from the moment I was born.
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 03.ogg I want to become a worthy archon.
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 04.ogg So I've kept studying...
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 05.ogg Kept listening to my people and their hearts...
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 06.ogg Kept looking for a way to save Irminsul...
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 07.ogg So I can catch up...
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 08.ogg Catch up to Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 09.ogg But, I'm stuck in the Sanctuary of Surasthana...
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 10.ogg The sages are creating a god to replace me...
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 11.ogg And I'm forced to lock my consciousness in this boundless darkness.
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 12.ogg It's... so quiet here.
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 13.ogg Now that I think of it, I don't think I've ever actually listened to my own inner voice...
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 14.ogg Do archons have them?
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 15.ogg Should archons have them?
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 16.ogg Have I been... doing the right thing?
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 17.ogg Am I... really not needed?
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 18.ogg How do I... really feel about all of this?
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 19.ogg It's... so quiet here.
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 20.ogg Who... are you? Whose voice is that? It sounds familiar...
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 21.ogg ...You're right, though.
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 22.ogg I won't... I won't ignore my own voice anymore.
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 23.ogg Nahida: Ah...
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 24.ogg Nahida: (Traveler)? Did you... wake me up? Thank you. Why are you here...
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 25.ogg Nahida: I'm fine. It's just...
Media:vo xmaq303 7 nahida 26.ogg Nahida: When I think of everything that's happened to me, I feel really angry now.
Media:vo xmaq303 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Eh, is this the right spot? Are you getting anything?
Media:vo xmaq303 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Aah, please work!
(The Traveler finds themselves in a completely dark location)
Media:vo xmaq303 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Eh? Oh, you're back, (Traveler). How's everything?
Media:vo xmaq303 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: That's wonderful news! Great, we weren't locked up for nothing!
Media:vo xmaq303 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: When you went to wake up Nahida, Paimon was listening for any sounds outside.
Media:vo xmaq303 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: You were out for a long time... There are fewer and fewer scholars going about now. You think everyone's done with their Jnagarbha Day stuff?
Media:vo xmaq303 7 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Yep, so that means our next act is... Nilou's performance!
Media:vo xmaq303 7 rukkhadevata 01.ogg Since you're the God of Wisdom...
Media:vo xmaq303 7 rukkhadevata 02.ogg You've known the answers to all these questions since the very beginning, haven't you?
Media:vo xmaq303 8 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: I'm sure, and I'm going. You know that I don't like to pass up any opportunity to dance, and this one is especially important.
Media:vo xmaq303 8 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: Don't worry, they've been through worse. Everything's going to be fine!
Media:vo xmaq303 8 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: Hehe, thanks, Mr. Zubayr. You're so very kind.
Media:vo xmaq303 8 nilou 04.ogg Nilou: This isn't the way to the Akademiya. Better stick to the plan.
Media:vo xmaq303 8 sheikhzubayr 01.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: Nilou, are you sure about this? You're taking such a great risk for them...
Media:vo xmaq303 8 sheikhzubayr 02.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: *sigh* Alright. You seem to have a lot of trust in them, so I won't say more on the subject.
Media:vo xmaq303 8 sheikhzubayr 03.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: But if anything happens, the few of us here may not be able to help you.
Media:vo xmaq303 8 sheikhzubayr 04.ogg Sheikh Zubayr: Alright. You know... if you really do get arrested, we'll do everything we can to get you back. Be careful, even if it's only for our sakes.
Nahida: ...
Observe the unconscious guards...: (If they were escorting someone before being knocked out, that person must've escaped.)
Observe the unconscious guards...: (Someone has knocked these two guards out and removed their Akasha Terminals not long ago. No one seems to have noticed them yet.)
Rahman: *whistle*
Rahman: *whistle*
(More Eremites enter the Grand Bazaar)
Uday: Grand Sage, there's some commotion outside...
Uday: Grand Sage, we have finished all required preparations for Jnagarbha Day
Uday: We may begin to enter the capsules now
