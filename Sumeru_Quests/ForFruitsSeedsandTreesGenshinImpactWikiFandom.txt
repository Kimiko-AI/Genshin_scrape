(The vines obstructing the entrance to Old Vanarana shrivel)

Arama: Queen Aranyani sang here — thousands of moons ago, or perhaps even more. She had just left Valuka at the time, and the woods weren't as lush as now, so there was still lots of sand on the ground.
Arama: Her Ararakalari was more powerful than any Aranara's, since her song was the closest to the Sourcesong. So Ashvattha responded to her call and sprouted from Sarva.
Arama: Queen Aranyani told Ashvattha that there were many smart, beautiful, yet lonely Nara in the woods and that the children of the forest must increase so that they might become friends with the Nara.
Arama: Therefore, Ashvattha produced a beautiful and full pomegranate with many seeds inside, the first of which to sprout was Aramuhukunda.
Arama: That made Aramuhukunda the very first Aranara. Later, all the seeds grew and Aranara spread like leaves on a tree. We and Nara were both people of the forest.
Arama: That's why the Ashvattha Tree is very powerful and very important! Just like Nara bear Nara children, all Aranara are progeny of Ashvattha and Queen Aranyani.

Arama: The Lord of Verdure sang here — thousands of moons ago, or perhaps even more. She had just left Valuka at the time, and the woods weren't as lush as now, so there was still lots of sand on the ground.
Arama: Her Ararakalari was more powerful than any Aranara's, since her song was the closest to the Sourcesong. So Ashvattha responded to her call and sprouted from Sarva.
Arama: She told Ashvattha that there were many smart, beautiful, yet lonely Nara in the woods and that the children of the forest must increase so that they might become friends with the Nara.

Arama: That made Aramuhukunda the very first Aranara. Later, all the seeds grew and Aranara spread like leaves on a tree. We and Nara were both people of the forest.
Arama: That's why the Ashvattha Tree is very powerful and very important! Just like Nara bear Nara children, all Aranara are progeny of Ashvattha, of the Dendro Archon..
 (Reach out to the Ashvattha Tree...)
(A domain transition occurs)
 About the Bija...
 And Arama is here too.
Arama: That's right! I'm here waiting for you to go to the Fane of Ashvattha together, to get the Bija, and to make Narana feel better.
 And we still have to help Rana.
Arama: Yes, we have to go to the Fane of Ashvattha to get the Bija, and to make Narana feel better!
 Arama...?
 Don't get in your own head, Paimon. Let's go.
Arama: That's right. We've got to go to the Fane of Ashvattha to get the Bija so Narana can get better!
 Give me some time to get ready.
Arama: Sure. Let me know when you're ready. I'll go with you!
 Give me some time to ready myself.
Arama: Sure. Let me know when you're ready. I'll go with you!
 How rude of you, Paimon, calling someone's mother weird like that.
Paimon: Paimon didn't mean to! Anyway, what do we need to do now to get the Bija?
 I believe you. What do we do now?
 I understand.
Arama: So long as you understand, Nara (Traveler), it's all good.
 Maybe some more time to ready myself.
Arama: Sure. Let me know when you're ready. I'll go with you!
 No problem.
Paimon: Arama just mentioned Marana... Paimon wonders what we'll see in this dream! Oh well, it's fine! We've got (Traveler) around, after all!
 (Reach out to the Ashvattha Tree...)
(A domain transition occurs)
 Give me some time to ready myself.
Arama: Sure. Let me know when you're ready. I'll go with you!
 No problem.
Paimon: Paimon believes it won't be a problem for (Traveler)!
 (Reach out to the Ashvattha Tree...)
(A domain transition occurs)
 Maybe some more time to ready myself.
Arama: Sure. Let me know when you're ready. I'll go with you!
 Piece of cake.
Paimon: But... Will what happened here affect the Bija in any way?
 Quest DescriptionWhen you wake up, Festival Utsava is no more, and Arama is nowhere to be found. Only the faint fragrance from the garland tells you that this was not a dream.
 Step DescriptionAshvattha Tree's dream has been corroded by The Withering. It may affect the outcome of the Bija, so the danger must be averted immediately.
 Step DescriptionThe Ashvattha Tree has been corroded. But from its fruit, Arama seems to have gained new knowledge, memories, and... manners of speech. According to Arama, you should eliminate Marana's Avatar next so that the new Ashvattha Tree may be born. Only then can the Bija be formed.
 Step DescriptionThe Withering Zone in the dream has been cleared up. Now, offer the Vasoma Fruits to Ashvattha's Tree of Dreams with Arama. Perhaps it'll be of help... Hopefully...
 That's amazing.
 That's kinda spooky.
 Then the Bija...
 Well, it wasn't as easy as Paimon made it sound...
Paimon: Well, you did it regardless, right?
Paimon: But... Will what happened here affect the Bija in any way?
 What's going on?
 What's wrong, Paimon?
Paimon: B—Because Vanarana is in a dream, and the fun we had at Festival Utsava was like a dream... Paimon was afraid that everything would all go away once we woke up...
Paimon: We'd be all that's left, just like when we first started the journey...
Arama: But the things that happen in dreams are real. I have observed Nara before and found that nightmares would make them timid, and that nice dreams would make them happy, just like things that happen outside their dreams.
Arama: So when Paimon dreamed of meeting us and also dreamed of meeting Vanarana, Paimon, it was as real as doing both in reality.
 And Arama is here too.
Arama: That's right! I'm here waiting for you to go to the Fane of Ashvattha together, to get the Bija, and to make Narana feel better.
 And we still have to help Rana.
Arama: Yes, we have to go to the Fane of Ashvattha to get the Bija, and to make Narana feel better!
Arama: *sob* So scary...
Arama: ...
Arama: Am I? I learned a lot of new things, figured out lots of new words, and obtained a lot of memories.
Arama: Are you ready to enter the Ashvattha Tree's dream, Nara (Traveler)?
Arama: But rest assured, I'm still me, your friend. I will help you for sure.
Arama: But the things that happen in dreams are real. I have observed Nara before and found that nightmares would make them timid, and that nice dreams would make them happy, just like things that happen outside their dreams.
Arama: Countless black pests are corroding the roots of the Tree of Dreams in Sarva. I can feel Marana's hands, shaking the dream to its core.
Arama: Don't worry about the Bija, Nara (Traveler) and Paimon. Let's just leave the dream for now.
(A domain transition occurs)
Arama: Don't worry, the speed of a Vasara Tree's growth has to do with its seed. The Ashvattha Tree has given me all its power, and with the Vasoma Fruits and our shared memory, it will be fine.
Arama: For as long as you wear this garland, the Ashvattha Tree will recognize you as a child of the forest.
Arama: Her Ararakalari was more powerful than any Aranara's, since her song was the closest to the Sourcesong. So Ashvattha responded to her call and sprouted from Sarva.
Arama: How did this...
Arama: I see! I just learned something new. Thank you, Paimon.
Arama: I'm sorry, Nara (Traveler) and Paimon. It escaped me that Marana has also corroded the Ashvattha Tree's dream...
Arama: I'm sorry. I didn't sooner realized why something was wrong with the Ashvattha Tree...
Arama: It will imbue the land and Sarva with viper venom until everything green turns brown, every flower has withered, every brook is putrid, and every creature is dead.
Arama: Just like the clouds know that they must release rain, and the rain knows that it must fall to the ground, seeds know that they must grow into big trees and bear lots of plump fruits.
Arama: Mmm...
Arama: Nara (Traveler), Paimon, you seem fresh, like fresh Zaytun Peaches. But Paimon looks unhappy. Did you have a nightmare?
Arama: Oh, I was just speaking to the Tree of Dreams. Huh, so you couldn't hear it.
Arama: Old Vanarana is sealed deep within the Fane of Ashvattha. That's where we'll find Marana's Avatar.
Arama: Queen Aranyani sang here — thousands of moons ago, or perhaps even more. She had just left Valuka at the time, and the woods weren't as lush as now, so there was still lots of sand on the ground.
Arama: Queen Aranyani told Ashvattha that there were many smart, beautiful, yet lonely Nara in the woods and that the children of the forest must increase so that they might become friends with the Nara.
Arama: Regardless, we're going into the Ashvattha Tree's dream next, and we'll offer the Vasoma Fruits to the Tree of Dreams. That should rejuvenate it!
Arama: Right. Just like trees need earth and rain to flourish, dreams and memories are what a Vasara Tree needs. As I mentioned a moment ago, the Ashvattha Tree is the oldest of the Vasara Trees.
Arama: She told Ashvattha that there were many smart, beautiful, yet lonely Nara in the woods and that the children of the forest must increase so that they might become friends with the Nara.
Arama: So long as you understand, Nara (Traveler), it's all good.
Arama: So when Paimon dreamed of meeting us and also dreamed of meeting Vanarana, Paimon, it was as real as doing both in reality.
Arama: Something's wrong with the Ashvattha Tree. It feels a bit weak... This must be because of the Marana that's been showing up everywhere lately.
Arama: Sorry... I should have known this would've been the case when we saw Marana in Ashvattha's Concourses before.
Arama: Stand closer to the Ashvattha Tree, Nara (Traveler).
Arama: Sure. Let me know when you're ready. I'll go with you!
Arama: Thank you, the first Ashvattha Tree. Thank you, Araji, Arayama, and Aramaha. I will utilize your memories to rebuild the path between the new Ashvattha Tree and the dreams.
Arama: That made Aramuhukunda the very first Aranara. Later, all the seeds grew and Aranara spread like leaves on a tree. We and Nara were both people of the forest.
Arama: That's right! I'm here waiting for you to go to the Fane of Ashvattha together, to get the Bija, and to make Narana feel better.
Arama: That's right. We've got to go to the Fane of Ashvattha to get the Bija so Narana can get better!
Arama: That's rude, Paimon! You'll make the Ashvattha Tree mad! This is a very, very mighty tree — the oldest Vasara Tree there is. Even older than any Aranara and their stories...
Arama: That's what they are, yes.
Arama: That's why the Ashvattha Tree is very powerful and very important! Just like Nara bear Nara children, all Aranara are progeny of Ashvattha and Queen Aranyani.
Arama: That's why the Ashvattha Tree is very powerful and very important! Just like Nara bear Nara children, all Aranara are progeny of Ashvattha, of the Dendro Archon..
Arama: That's why we've brought three Vasoma Fruits from Araji, Arayama, and Aramaha as offerings for the Ashvattha Tree to bear great fruit.
Arama: The Ashvattha Tree has been corroded by Marana and cannot bear any Bija. I have to plant a new Ashvattha Tree in order to help you.
Arama: The Fane of Ashvattha is over there! This is my first time visiting it! How exciting!
Arama: The Lord of Verdure sang here — thousands of moons ago, or perhaps even more. She had just left Valuka at the time, and the woods weren't as lush as now, so there was still lots of sand on the ground.
Arama: The Vasoma Fruits should at least restore some of his power. I'm counting on you, Nara (Traveler).
Arama: The seal is over there.
Arama: Therefore, Ashvattha produced a beautiful and full pomegranate with many seeds inside, the first of which to sprout was Aramuhukunda.
Arama: We must destroy it. Only then can a tree strong enough to produce the Bija grow.
Arama: We're here. This is the Fane of Ashvattha, I can feel it.
Arama: Why would you think that? I've been here the whole time.
Arama: Wonderful, this place isn't corroded by Marana like Arayama and the others were! Nara (Traveler), Paimon, this is the Ashvattha Tree.
Arama: Yes, I understand. I didn't think it would be so soon, but I'm aware that I'll know what to do when the time comes.
Arama: Yes, all Aranara are descendants of this tree. You're now connected to all Aranara, and you bear their blessings, and so the Ashvattha Tree shall bless you too.
Arama: Yes, we have to go to the Fane of Ashvattha to get the Bija, and to make Narana feel better!
Arama: Yes. Very smart, Paimon. So if you're ready, Nara (Traveler), reach your hand out and let's enter the Ashvattha Tree's dream.
Paimon: ...That's true. Bah, (Traveler), you must have put weird mushrooms in the feast to make Paimon think about such stuff.
Paimon: Araji, Arayama, and Aramaha's Vasoma Fruits? Don't you mean the fruits of the Vasara Trees?
Paimon: Arama just mentioned Marana... Paimon wonders what we'll see in this dream! Oh well, it's fine! We've got (Traveler) around, after all!
Paimon: Arama!
Paimon: But won't it require a long time to grow from a seed to a tree?
Paimon: But... Will what happened here affect the Bija in any way?
Paimon: B—Because Vanarana is in a dream, and the fun we had at Festival Utsava was like a dream... Paimon was afraid that everything would all go away once we woke up...
Paimon: Do you get the feeling that Arama's different now...
Paimon: Finally we are here. Huh... Paimon remembers that we could see this mysterious tree in other Vasara Trees' dreams as well!
Paimon: Huh!?
Paimon: It hasn't been easy, but Rana can finally be healed!
Paimon: It's alright! We've got (Traveler) here, so it's gonna be a piece of cake!
Paimon: It's finally gone, and it's all thanks to (Traveler). Let's go check out that tree, shall we?
Paimon: It's okay! We fixed this easily with (Traveler) around, didn't we?
Paimon: Let's go, then!
Paimon: Paimon believes it won't be a problem for (Traveler)!
Paimon: Paimon didn't mean to! Anyway, what do we need to do now to get the Bija?
Paimon: Paimon was afraid you'd abandoned us!
Paimon: Paimon's seen Aranakin talking to mushrooms before... But people can't normally communicate with plants, you know?
Paimon: Regardless, we've got to get rid of The Withering as soon as possible!
Paimon: So that's how it is... Sorry, Arama. The Ashvattha Tree is super impressive!
Paimon: So we're doing this like we did back in Ashvattha's Concourses, right? (Traveler) will reach out and "Woosh," we'll be in the dream!
Paimon: Something's weird about Arama...
Paimon: The heart of the Ashvattha Tree is glowing... Is that the Bija?
Paimon: We'd be all that's left, just like when we first started the journey...
Paimon: Well, you did it regardless, right?
Paimon: Whoa, what a weird-looking tree...
Paimon: Whoa...
Paimon: Why would The Withering be in the Ashvattha Tree's dream?
