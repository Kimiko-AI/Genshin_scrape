Media:vo xmaq009 3 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: It's one of the Sabzeruz Festival's traditions. People used to set their tables with seven different foods to symbolize the seven virtues of the Dendro Archon.
Media:vo xmaq009 3 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: Understood. I'll keep that in mind.
Media:vo xmaq009 3 kimiya 01.ogg Kimiya: ...The remnants appear to be in the form of the Moon.
Media:vo xmaq009 3 kimiya 02.ogg Kimiya: Hmm... The Moon signifies... Hmm... It's escaping me for now. Wait a moment...

Media:vo xmaq009 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Actually, what is the "Haft-Mewa Feast" you mentioned just now?
Media:vo xmaq009 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Really? Paimon thought it looked like some kind of food.

Media:vo xmaq009 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Guess that was still pretty interesting. Okay, on to the next stall.
Media:vo xmaq009 4 children 01.ogg Children: Farris! Farris!
Media:vo xmaq009 4 children 02.ogg Children: Yes, Knight Farris!
Media:vo xmaq009 4 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: Farris, the Knight of Flowers, is another Sabzeruz Festival icon, and one immensely popular with children.
Media:vo xmaq009 4 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: Oh, sure.
Media:vo xmaq009 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So... where to next?
Media:vo xmaq009 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What's going on? Is this a play?
Media:vo xmaq009 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Uhh, what's to pick? Don't these boxes all look the same?
Media:vo xmaq009 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Ooh, how interesting!
Media:vo xmaq009 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Ugh! Why do those flavors even exist!?
Media:vo xmaq009 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Traveler, help Paimon pick one. Paimon wants to eat the Sunsettia flavor!

Media:vo xmaq009 4 vihar 03.ogg Vihar: Oh, do you want some Yalda Candies? I happen to have some boxes readied here. Take a look and pick whichever one you want.
Media:vo xmaq009 4 vihar 04.ogg Vihar: Haha, it's not that simple. Each box contains a random flavor — it's up to the luck of the draw. Flavors include Lavender Melon, Harra Fruit, Sunsettia...
Media:vo xmaq009 4 vihar 05.ogg Vihar: ...And there's also Lizard Tail and Onikabuto.
Media:vo xmaq009 4 vihar 06.ogg Vihar: Great. These boxes of candy are numbered one to five from left to right. Which one do you want?
Media:vo xmaq009 4 vihar 07d.ogg Vihar: Ah, excellently chosen! Number four is indeed Sunsettia.
(If box number four was chosen)

Media:vo xmaq009 4 paimon 07d.ogg Paimon: Haha, Paimon bet you had incredible luck, and Paimon was right!
 That just now... I don't think that was luck.
 I don't know why, but I knew it must have been number four.
Media:vo xmaq009 4 paimon 07d 1.ogg Paimon: Huh? How's that possible? It's obviously random...
(If any other box was chosen)

Media:vo xmaq009 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Haha, Paimon bet you had incredible luck, and Paimon was right!
 Just now... Did I really mean to choose number four?
 It felt like... my body just subconsciously reached for it?
Media:vo xmaq009 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Huh? Are you saying that you instinctively chose the right box?
Media:vo xmaq009 4 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Hmm, but now that you mention it... Paimon also had the feeling you'd choose the right one... Is that kinda like what you felt?
Media:vo xmaq009 5 lambad 01.ogg Lambad: Welcome, you two! Are you here for lunch? What would you like to eat?
Media:vo xmaq009 5 lambad 02.ogg Lambad: Got it. You don't look like you're from these parts, but I gotta say, you've got good taste. I'll give this order to the kitchen.
Media:vo xmaq009 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: A feeling of... déjà vu?
Media:vo xmaq009 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon knows what that is! It's when you feel like you've already experienced whatever is going on...
Media:vo xmaq009 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: In that case, Paimon also felt something like that today... But that's just our brains playing tricks on us, isn't it?
Media:vo xmaq009 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: So, why'd you run here in such a hurry?
Media:vo xmaq009 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So that's it! You're intentionally doing things you usually wouldn't, and seeing if you still get that same feeling of déjà vu...
Media:vo xmaq009 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cake! Isn't it that... that burned thing that didn't look tasty at all?
Media:vo xmaq009 5 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Oh... Paimon understands what you're trying to do now... You'd never normally order something like this...
Media:vo xmaq009 5 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: That... thing... Are you really gonna eat it?
Media:vo xmaq009 5 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Isn't this... going a bit too far...
Media:vo xmaq009 5 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: H—How was it? The look on your face is telling Paimon that it tasted awful...
Media:vo xmaq009 5 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Then, you mean...
Media:vo xmaq009 5 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: That's impossible! We were just talking about how gross it looked...
Media:vo xmaq009 5 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: ...So would this be a case of taste bud déjà vu?
Media:vo xmaq009 5 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Paimon also gets the impression that we've been here many times, even though we aren't regulars.
Media:vo xmaq009 5 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Umm... How about... we go out again and try something else.
Media:vo xmaq009 6 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: Oh, I ran into some kidnappers just now, but thankfully, Dehya came to my rescue. I started to feel unwell after that, so I sat down here.
Media:vo xmaq009 6 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: I'm okay. Dehya's arm got scratched, but it isn't serious.
Media:vo xmaq009 6 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: Not at all. I've always been like this. Excessive physical exertion or strong emotions tend to aggravate my illness.
Media:vo xmaq009 6 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: Besides, no matter how amazing today may be, it is but a single day. After however many more days, my time will come to an end.
Media:vo xmaq009 6 dunyarzad 05.ogg Dunyarzad: It really is fine. I don't mind.
Media:vo xmaq009 6 dunyarzad 06.ogg Dunyarzad: Huh? Did something happen?
Media:vo xmaq009 6 dunyarzad 07.ogg Dunyarzad: Déjà vu? No, but my days have been the same for years now. Even if I were feeling déjà vu, I suppose I would already be used to it.
Media:vo xmaq009 6 dunyarzad 08.ogg Dunyarzad: It's almost time.
Media:vo xmaq009 6 dunyarzad 09.ogg Dunyarzad: Nilou's Dance of Sabzeruz is about to begin. Let's go.
Media:vo xmaq009 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, Dunyarzad is sitting by herself on that bench over there...
Media:vo xmaq009 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What a coincidence, Dunyarzad! We meet again! Uh, why are you sitting here all by yourself?
Media:vo xmaq009 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Kidnappers? Oh my goodness! Are you hurt?
Media:vo xmaq009 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Phew... That's a big relief. But Dunyarzad, you seem a little down today... It's the Sabzeruz Festival, and you've been looking forward to it so much.
Media:vo xmaq009 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Paimon doesn't quite follow you, and Paimon feels like something's really got you down right now....
Media:vo xmaq009 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Dunyarzad... have you ever felt déjà vu? You know... Like when you've already experienced something that's happening right now?
Media:vo xmaq009 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon sees... Then, is it only the two of us...?
Media:vo xmaq009 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Huh? Time for what?
Media:vo xmaq009 7 azar 01.ogg Azar: ...With your lack of intellectual credentials, I do not believe you are qualified to debate with me. What you should be doing is finding workers to tear down this ridiculous eyesore.
Media:vo xmaq009 7 azar 02.ogg Azar: When we return, have the Scribe draft an ordinance before the next Jnagarbha Day that prohibits public art performances. We will to the public announce it later via the Akasha.
Media:vo xmaq009 7 azar 03.ogg Azar: ...
Media:vo xmaq009 7 azar 04.ogg Azar: The Sabzeruz Festival... Go celebrate the birth of that god to your heart's content.
Media:vo xmaq009 7 dunyarzad 01.ogg Dunyarzad: It's okay. There's nothing we can do about it.
Media:vo xmaq009 7 dunyarzad 02.ogg Dunyarzad: It truly is unfortunate, but I don't wanna cause trouble for anyone. Didn't the Grand Sage say that he might investigate the organizers?
Media:vo xmaq009 7 dunyarzad 03.ogg Dunyarzad: The next festival... I probably won't be around by then.
Media:vo xmaq009 7 dunyarzad 04.ogg Dunyarzad: No, nothing. I'll be heading back to rest. Thank you for your help, everyone.
Media:vo xmaq009 7 nilou 01.ogg Nilou: Oh, Dunyarzad, the Grand Sage ordered us to stop the performance...
Media:vo xmaq009 7 nilou 02.ogg Nilou: But you've been really looking forward to this. I don't want you to have any regrets...
Media:vo xmaq009 7 nilou 03.ogg Nilou: True, but... *sigh* Well, okay, we'll just have to try again next year, hehe...
Media:vo xmaq009 7 nilou 04.ogg Nilou: Wait... What did you just say?
Media:vo xmaq009 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Nilou, are you okay?
Media:vo xmaq009 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon can't believe what those heartless geezers did!
Media:vo xmaq009 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Did Dunyarzad already go back? We should also return and get some sleep.
Media:vo xmaq009 7 setare 01.ogg Setaria: Understood. I will inform him when I return.
Media:vo xmaq009 8 azar 01.ogg ???: Continue to monitor for variances in the data, and find the cause as soon as possible.
Media:vo xmaq009 8 khajeh 01.ogg ???: ...Observing a modest drop in the output of Jnana Energy, but values still remain within normal parameters.
Media:vo xmaq009 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So in the end, you still couldn't figure out what that déjà vu feeling was all about?
Media:vo xmaq009 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Maybe it really was because of exhaustion...
Media:vo xmaq009 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Same here! That's why Paimon stopped thinking about it halfway through the day.
Media:vo xmaq009 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Then how about we settle in and get a good night's sleep. For now, we can chalk things up to exhaustion... We can do more thinking tomorrow!
The Sabzeruz Festival was forced to come to an unfortunately abrupt end...
