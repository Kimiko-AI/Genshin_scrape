Azalai: Hm... Ordered from Rama's? Should be alright.
Azalai: Her spices are both cheap and of good quality, very popular with the people of this village. Once they arrive, selling them shouldn't be a problem.
Thanks for your help, Traveler. This is your remuneration. And this Mora, please take it along, too.
Azalai: That miser Rama though... I've ordered so many times from her, and she never gave me a discount.

Azalai: I see, the quality of Butrus' Dried Fish is always reliable, and the quantity... not bad at all.
Azalai: When the goods arrive, I'll have to send some to doctor Maruf as thanks for treating my leg injury last time.
Azalai: There's also Raef and Fodil, they helped me unload cargo...
Azalai: Ahem! Thanks for your help, Traveler. This is your remuneration. And this Mora, please take it along, too.
Azalai: Fortunately, you ordered from Butrus. Giving some Dried Fish away shouldn't be a problem considering the order quantity.

Azalai: Ordered from Jut's? Are the prices high? Well, I'll have to raise my price point to match the cost then.
Azalai: But these spices seem to be of very high quality. I should not worry about selling them...
Azalai: By the way, Traveler, this is your remuneration.

Azalai: Purchased from Jahangir? The price is... *gasp* How can it be so pricey? What spices does he use? Mora itself?
Azalai: It's nothing I can't handle. Worst case scenario, I'll cut the Dried Fish up and sell it that way.
Azalai: Ah... Um, here is your payment, Traveler. Thank you for your help.
Azalai: How many pieces can these be cut into?
 About Azalai's order...
 About Butrus' location...
 About Jahangir's location...
 About Jut's location...
Azalai: You can't find his exact location? Okay... I'll mark that spot on the map for you.
 About Rama's location...
Azalai: You can't find her exact location? Okay... I'll mark that spot on the map for you.
 And those goods are...
Azalai: They are all daily essentials. Even though I'm usually quick to source them, they sell even quicker.
Azalai: I'm running a small business, so I can't always buy large volumes.
 I did.

 I thought everyone would dry fish on their own...
Azalai: Hahaha... Trust me, Traveler. Drying fish out in the desert is not a good idea...
 I'd like to order from you.
Jut: Alright. I'll go prepare the goods then.
(Obtain Jut's Receipt)
(Proceeds to next quest step)
 I'd like to place my order here.
Butrus: Alright! Hehe... I'll go pick out some Dried Fish and get someone to deliver his order to him in a bit.
(Obtain Butrus' Receipt)
(Proceeds to next quest step)
 I'd like to place my order here.
Jahangir: Okay! I'll send one of my employees to deliver the order when I'm done making Dried Fish.
(Obtain Jahangir's Receipt)
(Proceeds to next quest step)
 I'd like to place my order here.
Rama: Oh! Thanks for your patronage! Please wait a moment while I make preparations and arrange delivery.

 I'll check out what Butrus has to offer first...
 I'll check out what Jahangir has to offer first...
 I'll check out what Jut has to offer first...
Azalai: Thank you in advance. I'll mark his location on the map for you.
 I'll check out what Rama has to offer first...
Azalai: Thank you in advance. I'll mark her location on the map for you.
 I'll try my luck elsewhere.
Butrus: Don't be too long or there won't be any Dried Fish left.
 I'll try my luck elsewhere.
Butrus: Huh? Fine... Go ahead and compare prices.
Butrus: But I can't really afford to give you another discount. I won't make any profit otherwise.
 I'll try my luck elsewhere.
Jut: All good. If you still want to order from me, feel free to come back anytime.
 I'll try my luck elsewhere.
Jut: I understand. We're talking about no small sums. Careful consideration is highly advised, indeed.
 I'll try my luck elsewhere.
Rama: Alright. But hurry up, please. If you wait too long, I may be out of stock.
 I'll try my luck elsewhere.
Rama: Okay... Come back and tell me if you change your mind.
 If only you could find a long-term business partner...
Azalai: It's not like I haven't considered that, but look around you.
Azalai: Shipping goods into the village and running business here aren't exactly easy.
 I—I'm going to look elsewhere...
Jahangir: Huh? Didn't I say you wouldn't find such tasty Dried Fish elsewhere? There's not much to think about...
 I—I'm going to look elsewhere...
Jahangir: Huh? No need to rush, the price is negotiable. Besides, you won't find such tasty Dried Fish anywhere else!
 Leave it to me.
 Quest DescriptionAzalai from Aaru Village seems to be troubled by one of his orders.
 So spices are out of stock in your store?
Azalai: I wouldn't say we've run out completely... but given how big the sales volumes are, it's always better to have some more in stock.
 So that's what troubles you?
 Why the long face?
 You'll start drying it now?
Azalai: (Just think about all the trouble I have to go through for every batch of goods... *sigh*)
Azalai: Ah... Um, here is your payment, Traveler. Thank you for your help.
Azalai: Ahem! Thanks for your help, Traveler. This is your remuneration. And this Mora, please take it along, too.
Azalai: Ahem... that's a topic for another day. Traveler, perhaps you are getting ready to leave the village?
Azalai: Alright, come back anytime if you have any additional questions
(Obtain Azalai's Payment)
Azalai: Alright, come back anytime if you have any additional questions.
(Obtain Azalai's Payment)
Azalai: But my budget for this purchase is limited, so deciding which supplier to choose isn't going to be easy...
Azalai: But these spices seem to be of very high quality. I should not worry about selling them...
Azalai: But, alas... I can't find anyone who's planning to leave the village, and Raef and his crew aren't always available...
Azalai: By the way, Traveler, this is your remuneration.
Azalai: Fortunately, you ordered from Butrus. Giving some Dried Fish away shouldn't be a problem considering the order quantity.
Azalai: Hahaha... Trust me, Traveler. Drying fish out in the desert is not a good idea...
Azalai: Her spices are both cheap and of good quality, very popular with the people of this village. Once they arrive, selling them shouldn't be a problem.
Azalai: Hm... Ordered from Rama's? Should be alright.
Azalai: How did it go? Have you placed an order yet?
Azalai: How many pieces can these be cut into?
Azalai: How's it going, Traveler? Did you place the order for me?
Azalai: I see, the quality of Butrus' Dried Fish is always reliable, and the quantity... not bad at all.
Azalai: I wouldn't say we've run out completely... but given how big the sales volumes are, it's always better to have some more in stock.
Azalai: I'd like to give them a shot, just to see if there's any demand, but I'm not sure about the price point...
Azalai: I'd like you to do the same. Please remember to look for the cheaper supplier.
Azalai: I'll have to ask Raef to find someone...
Azalai: I'm counting on you, Traveler.
Azalai: I'm running a small business, so I can't always buy large volumes.
Azalai: I've been wanting to source some Dried Fish and need someone to place an order for me... Could you assist me with this?
Azalai: I've been wanting to source some spices and need someone to place an order for me... Could you assist me with this?
Azalai: If I'm unlucky, some low-volume goods may be out of stock soon...
Azalai: It's not like I haven't considered that, but look around you.
Azalai: It's nothing I can't handle. Worst case scenario, I'll cut the Dried Fish up and sell it that way.
Azalai: Jahangir has been using a new Dried Fish recipe recently — people say that the flavor is really good thanks to all the spices.
Azalai: Jut has recently got his hands on some novelty spices — the quality's quite promising. I'd like to give them a shot, just to see if there's any demand, but I'm not sure about the price point...
Azalai: Let me see... Butrus' Dried Fish are fairly priced and the taste is... acceptable.
Azalai: Let me see... Rama's spices are fairly priced and the quality is... serviceable.
Azalai: Oh, one more thing. Whenever I commissioned someone to place an order for me in the past, I'd ask them to look for a relatively cheap price point.
Azalai: One way or another, my business costs are slowly rising. To make ends meet, I have no other choice than to increase my prices.
Azalai: Ordered from Jut's? Are the prices high? Well, I'll have to raise my price point to match the cost then.
Azalai: Purchased from Jahangir? The price is... *gasp* How can it be so pricey? What spices does he use? Mora itself?
Azalai: Shipping goods into the village and running business here aren't exactly easy.
Azalai: Thank you in advance. I'll mark her location on the map for you.
Azalai: Thank you in advance. I'll mark his location on the map for you.
Azalai: Thankfully, the people of this village understand my predicament and are willing to support my business, otherwise... I would've gone bankrupt a long time ago.
Azalai: That miser Rama though... I've ordered so many times from her, and she never gave me a discount.
Azalai: The business strategy that's been working in Aaru Village so far is "selling more at a lower profit margin."
Azalai: There's also Raef and Fodil, they helped me unload cargo...
Azalai: They are all daily essentials. Even though I'm usually quick to source them, they sell even quicker.
Azalai: Traveler, please check out both suppliers and pick one to place an order with.
Azalai: What are you looking to buy, Traveler? I'm afraid that we may be somewhat out of stock.
Azalai: When the goods arrive, I'll have to send some to doctor Maruf as thanks for treating my leg injury last time.
Azalai: Whenever I want to source some wares, I need to ask those who happen to leave the village to place an order for me, then transport it to the village together with Raef.
Azalai: Yes... This is a desert village, so shipment has always been troublesome for us.
Azalai: You can't find her exact location? Okay... I'll mark that spot on the map for you.
Azalai: You can't find his exact location? Okay... I'll mark that spot on the map for you.
Azalai: You should be good to go now. I'm counting on you, Traveler.
Butrus: (I need to make more Dried Fish.)
Butrus: Alright! Hehe... I'll go pick out some Dried Fish and get someone to deliver his order to him in a bit.
Butrus: But I can't really afford to give you another discount. I won't make any profit otherwise.
Butrus: Don't be too long or there won't be any Dried Fish left.
Butrus: Huh... Azalai is looking to source some Dried Fish from me? No worries.
Butrus: Huh? Fine... Go ahead and compare prices.
Butrus: This amount of Mora is enough to buy a large quantity of Dried Fish. It should last him for a while.
Butrus: Though my Dried Fish is... well... faithful to the original flavor! No spices or anything like that.
Butrus: Welcome! Are you looking for fish? Then you've come to the right place! There are no fish fresher than mine. Ask that cat over there if you don't believe me.
Butrus: What say you? Want to order Dried Fish from me?
Jahangir: (I'm exhausted. I need to get some rest later...)
Jahangir: Ahaha, sure! I told him my Dried Fish is famous far and wide and will definitely sell for a good price.
Jahangir: Hey, have you decided yet? One word and I'll start prepping the everything.
Jahangir: Huh? Didn't I say you wouldn't find such tasty Dried Fish elsewhere? There's not much to think about...
Jahangir: Huh? No need to rush, the price is negotiable. Besides, you won't find such tasty Dried Fish anywhere else!
Jahangir: Of course not! What I meant was going to my warehouse to take the Dried Fish out and seasoning them to elevate their flavor profile.
Jahangir: Okay! I'll send one of my employees to deliver the order when I'm done making Dried Fish.
Jahangir: This amount of Mora will get you some Dried Fish. Just say the word and I'll make a fresh batch for you.
Jahangir: Wait a minute... With the cost considered, you won't be able to buy that much Dried Fish after all.
Jahangir: Welcome! Would you like to have a bite? Everything's freshly made.
Jut: (We're having fewer customers lately...)
Jut: All good. If you still want to order from me, feel free to come back anytime.
Jut: Alright. I'll go prepare the goods then.
Jut: But this is just my opinion. It's up to him what kind of goods he decides to sell.
Jut: Conversely, if he tries to sell expensive high-quality goods in Aaru Village, the return will be slow.
Jut: For this amount... He won't be able to buy much. However, my spices are worth a lot of Mora.
Jut: From what I gathered about business in Aaru Village... I'd say that "selling more at a lower price point" is the way to go.
Jut: Hi, are you shopping for spices?
Jut: How's it going? Made up your mind yet?
Jut: I understand. We're talking about no small sums. Careful consideration is highly advised, indeed.
Jut: Simply put, it's about selling goods of passable quality for a relatively low price, and selling large quantities fast as a way to make a quick return on the invested capital.
Jut: Well... Since it's his order, I'll add my two cents. As a friend, I don't really recommend him to buy from me.
Rama: (It's difficult to do business...)
Rama: Ahem! What's his budget today? Let's see... Ooh, quite a bit.
Rama: Alright. But hurry up, please. If you wait too long, I may be out of stock.
Rama: As for the selling price... Just like before, I suggest setting a slightly lower price point. That's an easy way to boost sales.
Rama: Huh? Azalai asked you to place an order for him? No problem at all...
Rama: It's just that he used to ask the Eremites to source his goods, and this time, he commissioned an Adventurer...
Rama: Made up your mind yet? Want to place your order with me?
Rama: Oh! Thanks for your patronage! Please wait a moment while I make preparations and arrange delivery.
Rama: Okay... Come back and tell me if you change your mind.
Rama: Thanks for your patronage! Please wait a moment while I make preparations and arrange delivery.
Rama: Uh, if you place an order at my store, the spices supplied by me should last him for a long while.
Rama: Welcome! Want to buy some spices? We have all the usuals, and all at affordable prices!
Thanks for your help, Traveler. This is your remuneration. And this Mora, please take it along, too.
You bring Azalai up to speed on sourcing goods
