 Well, I've spoken to cats before...
Paimon: You mean Neko? But she can speak our language. That doesn't really count as "cat-talk"...

(If the player succeeded)

Sareh: Oh, you brought the kitten back. Thank you so much.
Sareh: Well, it looks like you are doing pretty well with cat-talk.
Sareh: Here, please take this as compensation.
Sareh: There aren't many people who can pick up cat language this fast. You know... I could even use your help in the future.
 Meow!
Paimon: Hey, you can speak normally. Ms. Sareh is not a cat!
Sareh: I can see from your face that you were trying to say "my pleasure," but your pronunciation still has room for improvement, I think.
Sareh: It's okay though. I'll keep teaching you about cat language. We'll learn together!
(If the player failed)

Sareh: Eh? You didn't find the cat?

Sareh: Eh? You didn't find the cat?

Sareh: Oh, you brought the kitten back. Thank you so much.
Sareh: Well, it looks like you are doing pretty well with cat-talk.
Sareh: Here, please take this as compensation.
Sareh: There aren't many people who can pick up cat language this fast. You know... I could even use your help in the future.
 Meow!
Paimon: Hey, you can speak normally. Ms. Sareh is not a cat!
Sareh: I can see from your face that you were trying to say "my pleasure," but your pronunciation still has room for improvement, I think.
Sareh: It's okay though. I'll keep teaching you about cat language. We'll learn together!

Sareh: The one that has slipped out for a date today is a grey and black striped cat called "Rozan."
Sareh: In cat language, you would call for it by saying... "Meow meow meow, meow meow meow."
Sareh: Both sets of meows are quick sounds, so make sure you don't drawl.
Sareh: Actually... Let me write a note for you. Wait just a moment, will you?

Sareh: The one that has slipped out for snacks today is a dark grey cat called "Nargis."
Sareh: In cat language, you should call for it like this... "Meow! Meow meow, meow."
Sareh: Remember to stress the first meow and say the following ones quickly.
Sareh: Hmm... Let me write a note for you. Wait just a moment.

Sareh: The one that has slipped out today is a black and white cat called "Lale."
Sareh: In cat language, you should call for it like this... "Meow, meow meow meow, meow—"
Sareh: Keep in mind how the tone falls and then rises again. Make sure that the last "meow" is very high.
Sareh: Hmm... Let me write a note for you. Please wait just a moment.
 Can't you just call their names?
Paimon: Yeah. Don't people usually call kittens' names when looking for them, right?
Sareh: But if you call for them in our language, they can't understand it, can they?
 Could you help me with the cat's name in their language...
Sareh: That's on the note I wrote for you. Please refer to it if your memory fails you.
 Did I pronounce something wrong?
 Leave it to me...
 Looks like each city has its unique way of looking for cats...
Paimon: Heh, that's true! If you think about it, we've helped people find cats in quite a few cities by now...
Paimon: Should we say that everyone just loves cats, or that everyone who owns a cat has the same problem?
 Meow meow meow, meow meow meow.
Lale: Meow? Meow? Meow? Meow!
 Meow meow meow, meow meow meow.
Nargis: Meow? Meow meow meow...
 Meow meow meow, meow meow meow. (Correct answer)
Rozan: Meow, meow meow.
 Meow!
 Meow! Meow meow, meow.
Lale: Meow? Meow? Meow? Meow!
 Meow! Meow meow, meow.
Rozan: Meow... Meow meow, meow.
 Meow! Meow meow, meow. (Correct answer)
Nargis: Meow! meow meow meow—
 Meow, meow meow meow, meow—
Nargis: Meow? Meow meow meow...
 Meow, meow meow meow, meow—
Rozan: Meow... Meow meow, meow.
 Meow, meow meow meow, meow— (Correct answer)
Lale: Meow, meow meow, meow meow meow.
 No problem.
 Quest DescriptionSareh seems to be concerned about her cats...
 The payment should be...
 Uh, what are you doing...?
 Well, I've spoken to cats before...
 What did you mean by "your pronunciation today" being off, anyway?
Sareh: Well, I was calling their names, actually, just in the language of cats.
Sareh: After all, they wouldn't necessarily understand if we call them in our language, right?
 What?
 You don't seem too worried about them.
Sareh: Well, people in town love the cats. They often play with them and feed them.
Sareh: I'm just hoping that they don't eat too much and get overweight.
Lale jumps into your arms.
Lale turns around and runs away.
Lale: Meow, meow meow, meow meow meow.
Lale: Meow... meow meow?
Lale: Meow? Meow? Meow? Meow!
Nargis jumps on your shoulder and... Wow, it sure is heavy!
Nargis turns around and jumps into a pile of things nearby...
Nargis: Meow! meow meow meow—
Nargis: Meow... meow... meow meow...
Nargis: Meow? Meow meow meow...
Paimon: Does it mean "I'm not the cat you're looking for"?
Paimon: Eh?
Paimon: Eh? Well, you do have a point there...
Paimon: Eh? Why did it leave? Did you pronounce its name wrong?
Paimon: Heh, that's true! If you think about it, we've helped people find cats in quite a few cities by now...
Paimon: Hey, you can speak normally. Ms. Sareh is not a cat!
Paimon: Huh? Why did the kitty leave?
Paimon: Huh? Why did the kitty leave?
 Did I pronounce something wrong?
Paimon: Does it mean "I'm not the cat you're looking for"?
Paimon: This cat sure does have a personality...
Paimon: It doesn't sound happy... Did you pronounce its name wrongly?
Paimon: It's your turn to meow, (Traveler)! Come on, you can do it!
Paimon: Listen, Paimon thinks there's a cat meowing. It must be somewhere around here. Let's take a closer look.
Paimon: Should we say that everyone just loves cats, or that everyone who owns a cat has the same problem?
Paimon: So... it's willing to go with us?
Paimon: So... it's willing to go with us?
Paimon: What a polite cat...
Paimon: This cat sure does have a personality...
Paimon: This cat's pretty agile for a glutton...
Paimon: What a polite cat...
Paimon: Wow! That was quick! Looks like it worked...
Paimon: Yeah. Don't people usually call kittens' names when looking for them, right?
Paimon: You mean Neko? But she can speak our language. That doesn't really count as "cat-talk"...
Paimon: You mean you're gonna teach us how to talk to cats?
(If the player has met Neko)

 Well, I've spoken to cats before...
Paimon: You mean Neko? But she can speak our language. That doesn't really count as "cat-talk"...
Rozan nods gently...
Rozan shakes its head indifferently and leaves...
Rozan: Meow, meow meow.
Rozan: Meow... Meow meow, meow.
Rozan: Meow?
Sareh starts to write some notes...
Sareh: (Meow, meow...No, it should be, meow meow meow.)
Sareh: ...Would you like to learn the language of cats?
Sareh: Actually... Let me write a note for you. Wait just a moment, will you?
Sareh: After all, they wouldn't necessarily understand if we call them in our language, right?
Sareh: Ahem... Now, listen carefully. This is the outline of cat language that I've been working on for a long time.
(If the player receives the Lale Version)

Sareh: The one that has slipped out today is a black and white cat called "Lale."
Sareh: In cat language, you should call for it like this... "Meow, meow meow meow, meow—"

Sareh: But if you call for them in our language, they can't understand it, can they?
Sareh: Do you have any further questions, Traveler?
Sareh: Eh? You didn't find the cat?
Sareh: Here, please take this as compensation.
Sareh: Hmm... Let me write a note for you. Please wait just a moment.
Sareh: Hmm... Let me write a note for you. Wait just a moment.
Sareh: I can see from your face that you were trying to say "my pleasure," but your pronunciation still has room for improvement, I think.
Sareh: I hope that your talk with the cat goes well.
(Obtain Sareh's Note)
Sareh: I'll go find them myself later. Still, thank you for the trouble. Please take these as your payment, Traveler.
Sareh: I'm just hoping that they don't eat too much and get overweight.
Sareh: I'm looking for my kittens. Normally, they respond to my call.
Sareh: In cat language, you should call for it like this... "Meow! Meow meow, meow."
Sareh: In cat language, you should call for it like this... "Meow, meow meow meow, meow—"
Sareh: In cat language, you would call for it by saying... "Meow meow meow, meow meow meow."
Sareh: Indeed. Still, in exchange, you will need to help me find a cat.
Sareh: Is my pronunciation off today somehow? I've been calling them for ages, and none of them have answered. How strange...
Sareh: Is that so? Well, it's okay. Cat language is not easy for beginners, after all.
Sareh: Is that so? Well, it's okay. Cat language is not easy for beginners, after all.

Sareh: Oh, you brought the kitten back. Thank you so much.
Sareh: Remember to stress the first meow and say the following ones quickly.
Sareh: So you agree? Why, thank you so much!
Sareh: Still, I'm getting nowhere shouting myself hoarse like this.
Sareh: Thank you very much, Traveler. I'll be waiting for you here.
Sareh: That's on the note I wrote for you. Please refer to it if your memory fails you.

Sareh: There aren't many people who can pick up cat language this fast. You know... I could even use your help in the future.
Sareh: Traveler, I'd like to ask you a serious question.
Sareh: Well, I was calling their names, actually, just in the language of cats.
Sareh: Well, it looks like you are doing pretty well with cat-talk.
Sareh: Well, people in town love the cats. They often play with them and feed them.
You tell Sareh what happened...
