Kamisato Ayaka - Frostflake Heron
The lady of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, Kamisato Ayaka. Dignified and elegant, intelligent and tenacious.
All know that her character is unimpeachable, and that she is a gentle and approachable soul deeply loved by the people.
This is because she often represents the Yashiro Commission as it conducts affairs among the common folk.
But while she is often viewed as a restrained, collected individual, few understand that beneath the fame and the name, the young girl's heart is still filled with an unknown tenderness and loveliness.
 A vote?
 Actually, I didn't get much sleep.
Media:vo yweq001 6 hiiragichisato 01b 1.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: And yet, you're still just as composed as always.
 But we don't know anything about the competition...
 But we have other things to do...
 Calm down, Paimon!
 I understand how you feel.
 I'd be happy to help however I can.
 I'm used to it already...
 Isn't this a little sudden?
 Maybe start by explaining the letter... What was that about?
 No worries, he'll see what I'm made of.
 Not at all.
 Now that that's been cleared up...
 Oh, of course.
 Okay, I'll consider it.
 Quest DescriptionYou and Paimon were having a stroll across the Byakko Plain, intending to enjoy some hard-come-by peace and quiet, but you come across an unexpected conflict nonetheless...
 Step DescriptionNow that you've been unexpectedly challenged to a fight, it's time to pick up your blade and face your foes.
 We're friends, you can have my advice anytime.
 Yeah, what's all this about a chance to compete?
 Yes, I did, thanks.
Media:vo yweq001 6 hiiragichisato 01a 1.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: That's the Traveler, composed as always.
 You may continue your duel.
After having a look around, the two of you leave the arena...
All know that her character is unimpeachable, and that she is a gentle and approachable soul deeply loved by the people.
But while she is often viewed as a restrained, collected individual, few understand that beneath the fame and the name, the young girl's heart is still filled with an unknown tenderness and loveliness.
Kamisato Ayaka - Frostflake Heron
Media:vo dialog yweq001 hirotatsu 01.ogg Hirotatsu: Are you really going to enter the competition? Heh, in that case, see you in the arena.
Media:vo dialog yweq001 madaramehyakubei 01.ogg Madarame Hyakubei: Miss Kamisato should have arrived on Ritou by now. She went to discuss competition matters with Miss Hiiragi Chisato of the Kanjou Commission.
Media:vo dialog yweq001 madaramehyakubei 02.ogg Madarame Hyakubei: Miss Kamisato also has an important responsibility in the competition. Since you're going to see her, she can fill you in on the details.
Media:vo yweq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, do you hear that? Sounds like someone's arguing over there. Let's go see what's happening!
Media:vo yweq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh, why are those two fighting on the road?
Media:vo yweq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Whoa, come on now... You're the ones fighting in the middle of the road.
Media:vo yweq001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: And what do you mean we "know nothing of the sword arts"? When it comes to wielding a sword, the Traveler here is super strong.
Media:vo yweq001 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh, what's up with these guys? Now they're suddenly charging at us!? Ahh, watch out, (Traveler)!
Media:vo yweq001 1 tadaaki 01.ogg Tadaaki: Cut out that weak-sounding nonsense. C'mon, it's between you and me! There can be only one victor.
Media:vo yweq001 1 tadaaki 02.ogg Tadaaki: Yeah, we're disciples of the Kono Ittou Art, and are about to settle things with a duel. We don't want anyone getting in the way, especially outsiders like you who know nothing of the sword arts.
Media:vo yweq001 1 tadaaki 03.ogg Tadaaki: Sounds like a plan to me.
Media:vo yweq001 1 tadaaki 04.ogg Tadaaki: This single chance belongs to the Kono Ittou Art.
Media:vo yweq001 1 tadatsune 01.ogg Tadatsune: After all these years, senpai... I was hoping it would never come to settling this with real swords...
Media:vo yweq001 1 tadatsune 02.ogg Tadatsune: Hmm? Someone else is here? Hey, get away from here, you two!
Media:vo yweq001 1 tadatsune 03.ogg Tadatsune: Eh? So you're just another person looking to steal our chance to compete. In that case, we'd better team up and deal with this outsider first. What say you, senpai?
Media:vo yweq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whew... you finally got them to stop. Hey you two, this is all just a big misunderstanding! We're just passing through here. We didn't want to steal anything.
Media:vo yweq001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wait, what are you two mumbling about? You guys were at each other's throats just a moment ago.
Media:vo yweq001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wait wait wait, you mean you want (Traveler) to compete instead of you?
Media:vo yweq001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: And there they go, just like that... Ugh, so what do we do about this entry ticket they left us?
Media:vo yweq001 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Let Paimon see here... "Warrior's Spirit Swordfighting Competition... hosted by the Yashiro Commission." Hmm, since it's being held by the Yashiro Commission, why don't we go to the Kamisato Estate and ask about it?
(Obtain Warrior's Spirit Swordfighting Arena Ticket)
Media:vo yweq001 2 tadaaki 01.ogg Tadaaki: No need to say any more... What happened here only proves that we're out of our depth.
Media:vo yweq001 2 tadaaki 02.ogg Tadaaki: *sigh* Master did always tell us that no matter how strong you may become, there is always someone stronger. But we didn't listen...
Media:vo yweq001 2 tadaaki 03.ogg Tadaaki: As for this entry ticket, I'm afraid that no matter which of us use it, the results would be the same.
Media:vo yweq001 2 tadaaki 04.ogg Tadaaki: I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. We're disciples of the Kono Ittou Art. Just now, we were about to duel to see who would enter the Warrior's Spirit Swordfighting Exhibition.
Media:vo yweq001 2 tadaaki 05.ogg Tadaaki: This competition is very important to any practitioner of the sword arts, and since we rarely see anyone pass through here, we mistook you for a competitor trying to steal our entry ticket. Again, I apologize.
Media:vo yweq001 2 tadaaki 06.ogg Tadaaki: Ah, just a moment, please! If it wasn't for you, I would have never realized my own inadequacy.
Media:vo yweq001 2 tadaaki 07.ogg Tadaaki: Fine by me. Only a real swordsman is qualified to stand in the Warrior's Spirit arena. We still require more training.
Media:vo yweq001 2 tadatsune 01.ogg Tadatsune & Tadaaki: ...
Media:vo yweq001 2 tadatsune 02.ogg Tadatsune: Ugh... senpai, how could this happen? This youngster completely overwhelmed us with only a few moves!
Media:vo yweq001 2 tadatsune 03.ogg Tadatsune: I thought this would be our chance to show the power of the Kono Ittou Art to the world. Who knew we would be defeated before we even set foot in the arena...
Media:vo yweq001 2 tadatsune 04.ogg Tadatsune: Right, our fight just now was a real eye-opener. I know now that I must further cultivate both my mind and swordsmanship.
Media:vo yweq001 2 tadatsune 05a.ogg Media:vo yweq001 2 tadatsune 05b.ogg Tadaaki: Senpai, I have an idea. Why don't we give the entry ticket to (him?/her?)
Media:vo yweq001 2 tadatsune 06.ogg Tadatsune: It's up to you if you want to join. Either way, this entry ticket is useless to us now. We bid you two farewell.
Media:vo yweq001 3 hirotatsu 01.ogg Hirotatsu: Why hesitate when faced with such a great opportunity?
Media:vo yweq001 3 hirotatsu 02.ogg Hirotatsu: If you're not honored to be a part of Warrior's Spirit, there's no need for you to hold on to that entry ticket. There are plenty of others who are eager to enter.
Media:vo yweq001 3 hirotatsu 03a.ogg Hirotatsu: I don't mean any insult, Madarame. On the contrary, I would love to see the Traveler in action.
Media:vo yweq001 3 hirotatsu 04.ogg Hirotatsu: Everyone here has heard of you, even Miss Kamisato thinks highly of you. I always assumed you'd be someone we'd all look up to.
Media:vo yweq001 3 hirotatsu 05.ogg Hirotatsu: But now it seems everything we heard were nothing more than rumors. You lack spirit, and as for your swordsmanship... Well, I'm sure it's mediocre at best. Otherwise, you wouldn't hesitate even for a second about joining the competition.
Media:vo yweq001 3 hirotatsu 06.ogg Hirotatsu: You can run your mouth all you like, but this isn't something that can be proven with words. I, Hirotatsu, am a true warrior, and don't need to go around bragging to make a name for myself. I'll take my leave now.
Media:vo yweq001 3 madaramehyakubei 01.ogg Madarame Hyakubei: Traveler, Paimon, good to see you. Unfortunately, both the Commissioner and Miss Kamisato are out on business for the day. They are not here at the estate.
Media:vo yweq001 3 madaramehyakubei 02.ogg Madarame Hyakubei: Ahh, so the Traveler wants to enter the competition, too? I'm terribly sorry, but we were flooded with applicants, and all the entry tickets were already issued last week.
Media:vo yweq001 3 madaramehyakubei 03.ogg Madarame Hyakubei: But if you want tickets to see the final exhibition match, I'll see what I can do. Perhaps I can get you some...
Media:vo yweq001 3 madaramehyakubei 04.ogg Madarame Hyakubei: Indeed, Warrior's Spirit is a competition with a rich history in Inazuma. Not only is it a good opportunity for martial artists to test their strength, but it is also a form of honor.
Media:vo yweq001 3 madaramehyakubei 05.ogg Madarame Hyakubei: The Almighty Shogun hopes to use this opportunity to spread the elegance of the art of the sword to more people. The upcoming competition has introduced many new formats to appeal to a wide variety of spectators.
Media:vo yweq001 3 madaramehyakubei 06.ogg Madarame Hyakubei: Traveler, since you already have an entry ticket, you should enter the competition. It is a rare opportunity, after all.
Media:vo yweq001 3 madaramehyakubei 07.ogg Madarame Hyakubei: By the way, given you've only heard about the competition today, you probably don't know yet, but Miss Kamisato just...
Media:vo yweq001 3 madaramehyakubei 08.ogg Madarame Hyakubei: What are you saying, Hirotatsu? That's not how we speak to our guests.
Media:vo yweq001 3 madaramehyakubei 09.ogg Madarame Hyakubei: Hey c'mon, Hirotatsu, the Traveler isn't from a martial family. Besides, spirit and swordsmanship can also be displayed other ways besides competitions...
Media:vo yweq001 3 madaramehyakubei 10.ogg Madarame Hyakubei: Ah, I apologize about Hirotatsu. He's the type of person that tends to just say whatever comes to his mind.
Media:vo yweq001 3 madaramehyakubei 11.ogg Madarame Hyakubei: The competition starts on Ritou in two days. I didn't get a chance to tell you just now, but Miss Kamisato left for Ritou today to discuss competition matters with Miss Hiiragi Chisato.
Media:vo yweq001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh, we're not here to see them today. Actually, we were hoping to ask about the Warrior's Spirit Swordfighting Exhibition. You know, the event being hosted by the Yashiro Commission.
Media:vo yweq001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, no, no, let us explain! We were able to get our hands on an entry ticket today, but we haven't decided whether or not to participate. We wanted to get some info about it first.
Media:vo yweq001 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: From the sound of it, this competition is really popular.
Media:vo yweq001 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Agh, can you believe this guy!? That makes two groups of people talking down to us on the same day!
Media:vo yweq001 3 paimon 05a.ogg Media:vo yweq001 3 paimon 05b.ogg Paimon: Ugh, there's nothing Paimon hates more than people underestimating (Traveler) when they don't even know (him.../her...) Well, maybe feeling hungry is worse, but still!
Media:vo yweq001 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: But this Hirotatsu guy doesn't even know you! How can he say that you lack spirit and ability!? Oh, that's it, Paimon's mad now!
Media:vo yweq001 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: He deserves an ugly nickname, like... Umm, like... oh! "Not the Sharpest Samurai"!
Media:vo yweq001 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Does that mean you're entering the competition? Great, Paimon approves! Show "Not the Sharpest Samurai" that you're the real deal!
Media:vo yweq001 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Oh really? In that case, let's go meet Ayaka on Ritou. We can ask her for more details about the competition.
Media:vo yweq001 4 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, Paimon, nice to see you again. Welcome back to Inazuma.
Media:vo yweq001 4 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Ah, never mind that now. Paimon, you were asking about the Archon's Emissary?
Media:vo yweq001 4 ayaka 03.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: The Archon's Emissary has a special responsibility in the Warrior's Spirit event. However, it's hard to describe without touching on the origins of this event.
Media:vo yweq001 4 ayaka 04.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Warrior's Spirit originated from ancient Inazuman legends. It is said that a long time ago, the martial artist who was crowned champion would be granted the special honor of meeting and engaging in a sword duel with the Almighty Shogun.
Media:vo yweq001 4 ayaka 05.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: However, the Almighty Shogun was far more powerful than any human being. In a direct confrontation, the duel would be over in an instant.
Media:vo yweq001 4 ayaka 06.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Therefore, the Almighty Shogun would send one of her familiars as an emissary to the martial artist, who would then provide assistance and protection in the fight against the Shogun.
Media:vo yweq001 4 ayaka 07.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Because the Almighty Shogun decided to convey her skills and the will to protect the citizens of Inazuma through the form of martial arts, the duel was then aptly named Warrior's Spirit.
Media:vo yweq001 4 ayaka 08.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Later, the event evolved into a competition that focused on the art of swordsmanship, and the tradition of a duel with the divine has been retained as the final "exhibition match" of the competition.
Media:vo yweq001 4 ayaka 09.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: This final match allows later generations to understand the origin of Warrior's Spirit and the meaning of martial arts.
Media:vo yweq001 4 ayaka 10.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Yes. Nowadays, the Almighty Shogun won't attend the exhibition match in person, but she will still send a special envoy to fight on her behalf to display her divine strength.
Media:vo yweq001 4 ayaka 11.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Of course, the role of the "Martial Artist" goes to the winner of the competition, and the "Divine Familiar" will be fulfilled by a true swordsman, a role also known as the "Archon's Emissary."
Media:vo yweq001 4 ayaka 12.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: This time, I will be fulfilling the role of the Archon's Emissary.
Media:vo yweq001 4 ayaka 13.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: No, not at all. It's an honor for me to have an opportunity to promote the sword arts. If anything, it's your dedication to the event that everyone will appreciate.
Media:vo yweq001 4 ayaka 14.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, Paimon, now that you're here, Miss Chisato and I can show you around the competition venue.
Media:vo yweq001 4 hiiragichisato 01.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: What a coincidence. We just finished talking about the Archon's Emissary and whether the Traveler would be interested in the exhibition. And now here you are!
Media:vo yweq001 4 hiiragichisato 02.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: Oh, you've never heard of it? Didn't you come rushing back to Inazuma because of Miss Ayaka's letter?
Media:vo yweq001 4 hiiragichisato 03.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: Paimon's right. Though the Shirasagi Himegimi attends some festival ceremonies from time to time, it's not often that we get to see her excellent swordsmanship up close.
Media:vo yweq001 4 hiiragichisato 04.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: The Almighty Shogun said that this time, we need to host a competition aimed at the public and recruit a powerful ambassador to promote it. With that in mind, Ayaka was appointed as the Archon's Emissary.
Media:vo yweq001 4 hiiragichisato 05.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: Oh, and by the way, this is Onodera from Yae Publishing House. He specializes in organizing events and was sent to assist us. He was the one who suggested that Ayaka be the Archon's Emissary.
Media:vo yweq001 4 hiiragichisato 06.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: In addition, he proposed two strategies to increase the popularity of the competition... expanding the target audience and increasing word of mouth. His ideas have been most effective.
Media:vo yweq001 4 hiiragichisato 07.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: Although voting won't begin until the day of the competition, my retainers have already been speculating on which theme will win.
Media:vo yweq001 4 onodera 01.ogg Onodera: Well, "expanding the target audience" means getting more people involved in the competition.
Media:vo yweq001 4 onodera 02.ogg Onodera: Previously, competitors were required to be practitioners of one of Inazuma's schools of swordsmanship. However, this time, the requirements are different. Anyone who has a passion for martial arts can participate, regardless of nationality or status.
Media:vo yweq001 4 onodera 03.ogg Onodera: Some combat regulations have similarly been adjusted, weapons are no longer limited to one-handed swords. Any close-range weapon that meets the length and weight requirements can be used.
Media:vo yweq001 4 onodera 04.ogg Onodera: As for "increasing word of mouth," in my personal experience, the most effective method is to hold a vote.
Media:vo yweq001 4 onodera 05.ogg Onodera: That's right. In the past, it was the Almighty Shogun who decided what the Archon's Emissary would wear in the exhibition match. But this time, with support from the Almighty Shogun, we'll be giving that choice to the audience.
Media:vo yweq001 4 onodera 06.ogg Onodera: People can vote on one of the four seasonal styles, such as cherry blossoms or autumn leaves. Miss Kamisato will wear whichever outfit receives the most votes.
Media:vo yweq001 4 onodera 07.ogg Onodera: These plans are only possible because Miss Kamisato agreed to be the Archon's Emissary. I know this must be a lot of pressure for you, Miss Kamisato.
Media:vo yweq001 4 onodera 08.ogg Onodera: You flatter me, Miss Kamisato. Now then, I must get back to preparing some final details regarding the vote, so please excuse me.
Media:vo yweq001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ayaka, Chisato~!
Media:vo yweq001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Nice to see you too, Ayaka! Actually, we've decided to enter the Warrior's Spirit Swordfighting Exhibition. We heard you two were making preparations on Ritou, so we thought we'd come and check things out.
Media:vo yweq001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: The Archon's Emissary? What's that?
Media:vo yweq001 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Letter? What letter?
Media:vo yweq001 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Yeah! What's that?
Media:vo yweq001 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Whoa, sounds like a pretty important event.
Media:vo yweq001 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Oh, so that's what this is all about! Paimon gets why this competition is so popular now! After all, Ayaka is popular among the citizens of Inazuma.
Media:vo yweq001 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Wow, those ideas sound pretty professional! But, uh, what do they actually mean?
Media:vo yweq001 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: That'd be great! Let's go!
Media:vo yweq001 5 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: This is the indoor training area for the Kanjou Commission. It's thanks to Miss Chisato that we were able to use this venue.
Media:vo yweq001 5 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Ahem. Traveler, do you have a moment... to talk?
Media:vo yweq001 5 ayaka 03.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Hmm, where should I begin...
Media:vo yweq001 5 ayaka 04.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Ah yes, that... Nothing slips by you. To be honest, I felt a little apprehensive when I first heard that everyone wanted me to be the Archon's Emissary.
Media:vo yweq001 5 ayaka 05.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I've been making public appearances ever since I was a child, but this is the first time I've ever acted as the ambassador for such an event, not to mention wearing an extravagant outfit while participating in combat.
Media:vo yweq001 5 ayaka 06.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: In the past, only the most skilled swordsmen of a reputable clan in Inazuma were qualified to be the Archon's Emissary. I'm afraid my skills can't even begin to compare to theirs.
Media:vo yweq001 5 ayaka 07.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I was worried that I might not be up to the task, so I wanted to write to you and ask for your advice at that time.
Media:vo yweq001 5 ayaka 08.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, I know. But that's probably why I didn't send the letter in the end.
Media:vo yweq001 5 ayaka 09.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: You've helped me many times before, and you've always lent me your ear when I speak about my troubles. But if I'm always turning to you for help, it almost feels like you're somehow besting me.
Media:vo yweq001 5 ayaka 10.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Hehe, is it strange for a friend to think that way?
Media:vo yweq001 5 ayaka 11.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you. I was really delighted to learn that you also entered the competition...
Media:vo yweq001 5 ayaka 12a.ogg Media:vo yweq001 5 ayaka 12b.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I was just saying that it's delightful to have the Traveler join the competition. Given (his/her) reputation in Inazuma, the competition is sure to be even more exciting.
Media:vo yweq001 5 ayaka 13.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: It's getting late and Miss Chisato and I must return now. The two of you should have a good rest for the next couple days. We'll see you on the day of the competition.
Media:vo yweq001 5 hiiragichisato 01.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: You're very welcome, Miss Ayaka. I'm only happy I could help.
Media:vo yweq001 5 hiiragichisato 02.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: Oh, that? Well, it's...
(Paimon and Chisato walk away)
Media:vo yweq001 5 hiiragichisato 03.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: Paimon's right, I look forward to seeing you perform.
Media:vo yweq001 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa, now this is an arena... Paimon had no idea the Outlander Affairs Agency would have a place like this.
Media:vo yweq001 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Chisato, what's that over there?
Media:vo yweq001 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hey Ayaka... Huh? What were you two chatting about?
Media:vo yweq001 5 paimon 04a.ogg Paimon: Heehee, yep! Having the Traveler join will definitely heat things up a little!
Media:vo yweq001 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Thanks, you two! Will do! See you on the day of the competition!
Media:vo yweq001 6 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Ah Traveler, Paimon, you made it. Did you rest well yesterday?
Media:vo yweq001 6 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Good luck, Traveler. I hope you'll do well in the competition.
Media:vo yweq001 6 hiiragichisato 01a 1.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: That's the Traveler, composed as always.
Media:vo yweq001 6 hiiragichisato 01b 1.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: And yet, you're still just as composed as always.
Media:vo yweq001 6 hiiragichisato 02.ogg Hiiragi Chisato: Well, Miss Ayaka and I should go watch the matches. See you later.
Media:vo yweq001 6 mizuta 01.ogg Mizuta: Mr. Onodera, we'll start with the box for Warrior's Spirit then!
Media:vo yweq001 6 onodera 01.ogg Onodera: Looks like you all are in good spirits today. Everything should be set to go for the opening match...
Media:vo yweq001 6 onodera 02.ogg Onodera: That's right, I've arranged everything. The box on the left contains the ballots for Warrior's Spirit, while the box on the right is for the other events. The results will be revealed in the third round of the competition.
Media:vo yweq001 6 onodera 03.ogg Onodera: And given how strong the Traveler is, you're practically guaranteed to make the third round, right?
Media:vo yweq001 6 onodera 04.ogg Onodera: Alright, thank you!
Media:vo yweq001 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Today's the opening ceremony for the Warrior's Spirit Swordfighting Exhibition. C'mon, let's head to the arena.
Media:vo yweq001 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh look, there's Ayaka and Chisato.
Media:vo yweq001 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Mhm, it's important to keep a good mood before a competition. We're in it to win it!
Media:vo yweq001 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Speaking of which, are these two boxes for voting?
Media:vo yweq001 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: You bet!
Media:vo yweq001 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Things are about to start soon. Let's head to the arena.
The lady of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, Kamisato Ayaka. Dignified and elegant, intelligent and tenacious.
This is because she often represents the Yashiro Commission as it conducts affairs among the common folk.
