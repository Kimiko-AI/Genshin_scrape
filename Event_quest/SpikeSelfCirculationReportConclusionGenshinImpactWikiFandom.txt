 I'll be waiting eagerly for that day to come.
 Most of the dark mud is gone.
 Quest DescriptionThe Spike is gradually sealing the Ley Line rupture up. Inform Hosseini of this result.
 Yes. It went well.
Hosseini: Good, good. Though the Pursina's Spike cannot seal the opening in one go, as long as it is successful once, continued operation should not be an issue.
Hosseini: Haha! Well, I fear I'm not hardly as good at writing stories as I am at reports.
Hosseini: How did it go? Did you manage to operate the Spike successfully?
Hosseini: I can only hope that you'll forgive any flaws in my work.
Hosseini: I might even write it into my future memoirs. I can see it now: "My Experiments With the Preternaturally Skilled (Traveler) at The Chasm..."
Hosseini: I must record this... For all I know, I may yet become a figure of some influence in the Akademiya once the full research report on the Pursina's Spikes is submitted.
Hosseini: Our problem is, therefore, solved.
Hosseini: This means that it's really just a matter of time before the opening closes completely.
