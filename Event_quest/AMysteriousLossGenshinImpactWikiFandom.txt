(Obtain Viktor's Lost Box)
 And as for our "deal"?
 Bit hard to search without leads, don't you think?
Viktor: Um, alright, one moment. Let me try to remember...
Viktor: No, nothing comes to mind: There's nothing special about the box, either...
 Then if I may ask you something...
Viktor: Sure. What would you like to know?
 What were you doing out there?
Viktor: Oh, come on... What's with that look of suspicion?
Viktor: I just went out for a stroll, really! I legged it back here the moment those meteorites started falling.
Viktor: Well, whatever. Go out there and have a look. Come back and look for me if you really can't find it.
Viktor: I'll give it a bit more thought. Maybe I'll remember something...
 What's in the box?
Viktor: That's, uh, none of your business. Just a few odds and ends...
Viktor: Come on! Don't look at me like that. I'm not some kind of villain!
 But you're with the Fatui.
Viktor: Fatui this, Fatui that... So all of us are the bad guys now? What sort of logic is that?
Viktor: Well, whatever. Go out there and have a look. Come back and look for me if you really can't find it.
Viktor: I'll give it a bit more thought. Maybe I'll remember something...
 What happened while you were running back here?
Viktor: While I was running back? Hmm, let's see... No, I can't recall any details.
Viktor: Ah, yes! I did encounter large group of Electro Slimes near the Thousand Winds Temple on the way back. They gave me a few hard knocks, causing the box to fall out!
Viktor: Now, I did manage to grab it back, but... I wound up losing it again in my haste.
Viktor: Still, since the box was touched by those Electro Slimes, it should have some elemental traces on it.
Viktor: In any case, try following the trail of Electro traces and see what you can find.
Viktor: Once you've found the box, bring it back to me.
 But you're with the Fatui.
 Got it right here.
 I'll help you out.
Viktor: That's great. Now, let me think... While I can't remember the details, I was wandering around the Thousand Winds Temple earlier...
Viktor: But as I was running back, I encountered a large group of Electro Slimes. I got careless and took a few hits from them, and the box fell out...
Viktor: Now, I did manage to grab it back, but... I wound up losing it again in my haste.
Viktor: Still, since the box was touched by those Electro Slimes, it should have some elemental traces on it.
Viktor: In any case, try following the trail of Electro traces and see what you can find.
Viktor: Once you've found the box, bring it back to me.
Viktor: Well... you can also come back and look for me if you really can't find it.
Viktor: I'll give it a bit more thought. Maybe I'll remember something...
 It's a little hard to search without any clues, you know...
Same as "Bit hard to search without leads, don't you think?" above
 Quest DescriptionMany meteorites have landed outside the city of Mondstadt, wreaking havoc everywhere. Viktor appears to have lost something important, and is talking to himself, flummoxed...
 So, what do you know about the meteorites?
Viktor: The meteorites... Well, not that I don't want to tell you, but I have no clue either.
Viktor: All I do is stand here in Mondstadt, unable to leave or move. What do I know?
Viktor: But my gut feeling tells me that those meteorites don't bode well...
Viktor: I'd stay out of this one if I were you. It can only mean trouble.
 Something wrong?
 Stop saying such suspicious stuff.
 Then if I may ask you something...
 What about the other Fatui in the city?
Viktor: Oh, them? They're probably spinning their wheels here, just like me.
Viktor: *sigh* I wonder when these days will finally end...

Paimon: Huh? This box is...
Paimon: Let's keep looking.
Paimon: Maybe it's the one Viktor lost. Let's bring it back and let him have a look at it.
Paimon: The area around the Thousand Winds Temple... We should pretty close.
Paimon: These electro traces... Maybe they come from that box.
Paimon: Use your Elemental Sight and have a look around!
Viktor: *sigh* I wonder when these days will finally end...
Viktor: Ah, yes! I did encounter large group of Electro Slimes near the Thousand Winds Temple on the way back. They gave me a few hard knocks, causing the box to fall out!
Viktor: All I do is stand here in Mondstadt, unable to leave or move. What do I know?
Viktor: And, well... I'm Fatui. If I were to make any sudden moves, I'd be suspected of doing something untoward for sure...
Viktor: Bah, enough nonsense. Could you help me look for that thing?
Viktor: But as I was running back, I encountered a large group of Electro Slimes. I got careless and took a few hits from them, and the box fell out...
Viktor: But just as I left the city, thinking to go to the Thousand Winds Temple for a stroll... all these meteorites started raining down from the sky.
Viktor: But my gut feeling tells me that those meteorites don't bode well...
Viktor: Come on! Don't look at me like that. I'm not some kind of villain!
Viktor: Fatui this, Fatui that... So all of us are the bad guys now? What sort of logic is that?
Viktor: Gah! Staying here was just too boring, what with the weird looks the nuns give me and all, so I decided to get out, get some fresh air...
Viktor: Given all the chaos out there, I didn't dare to go out to look for it, either.
Viktor: Have you found that box?
Viktor: I just went out for a stroll, really! I legged it back here the moment those meteorites started falling.
Viktor: I'd stay out of this one if I were you. It can only mean trouble.
Viktor: I'll give it a bit more thought. Maybe I'll remember something...
Viktor: If you can't, well... then I'm done for...
Viktor: In any case, try following the trail of Electro traces and see what you can find.
Viktor: No, nothing comes to mind: There's nothing special about the box, either...
Viktor: Now, I did manage to grab it back, but... I wound up losing it again in my haste.
Viktor: Oh, come on... What's with that look of suspicion?
Viktor: Oh, them? They're probably spinning their wheels here, just like me.
Viktor: Oh, this is terrible. I'm finished for sure...
Viktor: Once you've found the box, bring it back to me.
Viktor: Our transactions have been quite amiable so far, and I plan to continue doing good business with you...
Viktor: Still, since the box was touched by those Electro Slimes, it should have some elemental traces on it.
Viktor: Sure. What would you like to know?
Viktor: That's all I can remember. Find me that box, and quickly.
Viktor: That's great. Now, let me think... While I can't remember the details, I was wandering around the Thousand Winds Temple earlier...
Viktor: That's, uh, none of your business. Just a few odds and ends...
Viktor: The meteorites... Well, not that I don't want to tell you, but I have no clue either.
Viktor: There was no way I was staying out there, so I ran back into the city... And that's when I realized that I left a box behind...
Viktor: Uh, fine... Fine, I get it. Out with it, then. What do you want to know this time?
Viktor: Um, alright, one moment. Let me try to remember...
Viktor: Well, how about it? Will you help me out, or won't you?
Viktor: Well, whatever. Go out there and have a look. Come back and look for me if you really can't find it.
Viktor: Well... you can also come back and look for me if you really can't find it.
Viktor: What? Come now, there was nothing suspicious about the stories I told you...
Viktor: What? Did you need something else?
Viktor: While I was running back? Hmm, let's see... No, I can't recall any details.
Viktor: You... actually managed to find it! Phew... That's good... That's good.
