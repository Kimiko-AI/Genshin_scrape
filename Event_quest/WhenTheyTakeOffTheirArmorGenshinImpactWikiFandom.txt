 Got it. Coming right up.
 I can make you another one...
 I think I know who he's talking about...
 No.
 Please come again.
 Quest Description"Has anyone seen Captain Kaeya?" "Kaeya? you'll find him in the tavern. Hehe... You must be new here, no? Well, good luck!"
 What about you, Kaeya? How's your drink?
Another familiar face has arrived at the tavern.
Media:Vo eqtj002 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh, this doesn't look like the drink they ordered. Just give this one to Paimon and try making another.
Media:vo eqtj002 1 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Well, well. This is a surprise. I didn't expect to see you two behind the counter today.
Media:vo eqtj002 1 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: In that case, I'd like a Death After Noon...
Media:vo eqtj002 1 kaeya 03a.ogg Media:vo eqtj002 1 kaeya 03b.ogg Kaeya: Come now, I just wanted to see how (he'd/she'd) react. I admit I didn't expect to see you here today, Sister Rosaria.
Media:vo eqtj002 1 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: With so many demanding customers that frequent the tavern, I only thought I'd help the Traveler gain some experience.
Media:vo eqtj002 1 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Don't get me wrong, I was only trying to be helpful! If anything, you should be thanking me. Now, how about we start with something simple like a Moonlit Alley, for instance.
Media:vo eqtj002 1 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Oh, and make it a large, please.
Media:vo eqtj002 1 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Please, take your time. Waiting in anticipation is half the fun.
Media:vo eqtj002 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: There he goes with that smooth talk again!
Media:vo eqtj002 1 rosaria 01.ogg Rosaria: Leave it to Kaeya to make things difficult right from the start...
Media:vo eqtj002 1 rosaria 02.ogg Rosaria: I'll leave my drink up to you. Just make it a tea of some kind, and not too big.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Ah, I presume you're referring to the church?
Media:vo eqtj002 2 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Sounds to me like Mondstadt's just gained another black tea lover.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: That depends. If I point out a few flaws, will you make me another one?
Media:vo eqtj002 2 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Hahaha, I'm just kidding. I'd never subject you to such treatment.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Hey! How could you divulge so much about your dear old drinking buddy, hmm?
Media:vo eqtj002 2 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Ooh, are we gossiping about people who take themselves too seriously, now?
Media:vo eqtj002 2 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Speaking of which, I know someone who could easily place in the "Top Three Most Serious People in Mondstadt."
Media:vo eqtj002 2 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: As to their level of seriousness... Well, let me put it this way, they probably wouldn't even flinch if I said that to their face.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Of course. Just off the top of my head, there's a running list for the most consistent drinkers, hardest workers, worst cooks, or even... biggest hoarders of dark secrets.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: Why, of course. How about, "Best Bartenders"?
Media:vo eqtj002 2 kaeya 11a.ogg Kaeya: You can say that again. Just looking at these two brings a smile to my face.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Good bartenders create a nice atmosphere and get people in a good mood. You know, like a mascot... so I guess there's really no contest for the title of "Best Bartenders."
Media:vo eqtj002 2 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: Heh, nothing. Thanks for your hospitality.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: Until next time.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What is it, Rosaria? You don't like the drink?
Media:vo eqtj002 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Boy, you're in rare form today, Rosaria.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Gosh, Kaeya sure is a tough nut to crack, you never know what he'll say next. How can you stand to drink with this guy, Rosaria?
Media:vo eqtj002 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Are there really rankings for people like that?
Media:vo eqtj002 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Sounds to Paimon like Mondstadters have way too much time on their hands!
Media:vo eqtj002 2 paimon 06a.ogg Media:vo eqtj002 2 paimon 06b.ogg Paimon: Aww, but what about Paimon? Is there a category that Paimon can be ranked as high as (him/her)?
Media:vo eqtj002 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Râ€”Really!?
Media:vo eqtj002 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: That's great, (Traveler)! Our names will be remembered together forever!
Media:vo eqtj002 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Huh?
Media:vo eqtj002 2 rosaria 01.ogg Rosaria: Hmm...
Media:vo eqtj002 2 rosaria 02.ogg Rosaria: No, the drink you made me is fine. It's just that I rarely ever drink tea. The taste always reminds me of certain... things.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 rosaria 03.ogg Rosaria: Yes. The church once held an event that I couldn't attend, but Sister Barbara still saved some tea and dessert for me...
Media:vo eqtj002 2 rosaria 04.ogg Rosaria: The dessert had already gone stale, so she whisked it away when I wasn't looking, but the tea tasted just like this drink you made me.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 rosaria 05.ogg Rosaria: Heh, I'd prefer something a little stiffer.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 rosaria 06.ogg Rosaria: Hmm? I don't really care what's going through his mind, as long as we only talk about drinks.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 rosaria 07.ogg Rosaria: Besides, Kaeya's only interested in people or things that intrigue him, whether that's you, the innkeeper here, or anybody else...
Media:vo eqtj002 2 rosaria 08.ogg Rosaria: You think I'm saying too much? Heh, get over yourself, it's no big deal.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 rosaria 09.ogg Rosaria: Ugh, I'm constantly surrounded by uptight folks day-to-day. I prefer the easygoing atmosphere in the tavern.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 rosaria 10.ogg Rosaria: Are there really that many people who don't need to work?
Media:vo eqtj002 2 rosaria 11.ogg Rosaria: Heh...
Media:vo eqtj002 2 rosaria 12.ogg Rosaria: Well, I must admit, the atmosphere you bring isn't half bad.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 rosaria 13.ogg Rosaria: Yeah, I should be going, too.
Media:vo eqtj002 2 rosaria 14.ogg Rosaria: By the way, that black tea tasted great. I'll try to make some for myself in the future... if I can manage to get up early enough in the morning, that is.
Traveler: (Alright, this drink is looking good.)
Traveler: (Done. Let's get started on the next drink.)
