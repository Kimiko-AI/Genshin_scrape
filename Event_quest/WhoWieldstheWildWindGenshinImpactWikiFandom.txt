 Quest DescriptionNo one knows why, but this island seems to be forever affected by strange weather conditions...
Paimon: ...Samachurls? And so many other monsters too. What are they doing on this mountain?
Paimon: Does that sealed chest and the weird weather around here have something to do with them?
Paimon: Hmm, these three mountains are kinda bothering Paimon...
Paimon: Huh. Well, let's go back and check that chest out.
Paimon: Let's climb them and see what we can find out.
Paimon: Looks like that sealed chest and the weather on this island really do have something to do with these monsters...
Paimon: Phew... finally got the chest open.
Paimon: That was quite a load of work just to open one chest...
Paimon: The weather here's so weird. It doesn't seem natural.
Paimon: The weather looks fine too, now that we've beaten those monsters...
Paimon: There's a chest here? Looks like it's locked.
Paimon: Wait, where did this guy come from? Kâ€”Keep it back!
