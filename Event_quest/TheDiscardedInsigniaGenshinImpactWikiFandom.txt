Chevka: That's all I know. I made arrangements with the other team members that we'd go back to our base camp in the center of the sea once we finished testing...
Paimon: Ah, you must be referring to the Fatui we met earlier!
Chevka: Oh, so you've met them, have you...
Chevka: *sigh*... Agafya would be crazy mad at me if she saw Yakov like this... But I've got to bring Yakov back no matter what!

Electrohammer Vanguard: I gotta find the insignia... That's the only way...

Electrohammer Vanguard: It's all my fault... I'm the reason he became like that...
Electrohammer Vanguard: No, I need to... bring the insignia back to him... I've got to find it...
Paimon: Hey! What are you doing here?
Electrohammer Vanguard: The insignia... The insignia...
Paimon: Gah, he's completely ignoring us...
 A little louder, Paimon!
Paimon: It's pretty clear that he can't hear us. Speaking louder won't help at all...
Paimon: He acts exactly like Agafya earlier, remember? She came to reason as soon as we gave her the pocket watch with a picture.
Paimon: Maybe there is also something that can wake the Electrohammer Vanguard from the impact of the machine?
Paimon: Seems like he's looking for some kind of insignia... Guess we need to find it for him, (Traveler).

Electrohammer Vanguard: It's all my fault... I'm the reason he became like that...
Electrohammer Vanguard: No, I need to... bring the insignia back to him... I've got to find it...
Paimon: What's that Fatui guy muttering about?
Paimon: Hey, what are you doing here?
Electrohammer Vanguard: The insignia... The insignia...
 He doesn't look quite all there.
 I don't think we're getting through to him...
Paimon: Well... this does worry Paimon a little. Why is this Electrohammer Vanguard here? He isn't up to something bad, is he?
Paimon: (Traveler), how should we deal with this guy?
 Eh, only his charging attack is any threat...
Paimon: Right, Electrohammer Vanguards are pretty dangerous when they sprint at full tilt... Wait, no, that's not what Paimon was talking about!
Paimon: What Paimon meant is... Shouldn't we, y'know, wake him up and ask him what he's doing here...?
 It is quite the curious thing, indeed...
Paimon: Yeah. It's not every day we have a Fatuus here muttering about some insignia or whatever... It seems like he's looking for something.
Paimon: This really isn't something that happens every day.
Paimon: Still, Paimon wonders what happened to leave him in this state...
 It must've been that machine's fault...
Paimon: Right, the Fatui were also affected by the machine. But isn't there anything we can do to bring him back to his senses?
Electrohammer Vanguard: I gotta find the insignia... That's the only way...
Paimon: Seems like he's looking for some kind of insignia... Guess we need to find it for him, (Traveler).
 (He still doesn't seem to be in his right mind...)
 (Let's leave him alone for now...)
 (Let's talk to him after we find the insignia...)
 (We aren't getting through to him...)
 A good father would never say something like that!
 A little louder, Paimon!
 About Yakov...
Chevka: *sigh* It seems that Yakov is still delirious...
 Can't believe your old man actually said that...
 Eh, only his charging attack is any threat...
 Harsh indeed...
 He doesn't look quite all there.
 I don't think we're getting through to him...
 It is quite the curious thing, indeed...
 It must've been that machine's fault...
 It's nothing.
 Quest DescriptionYou meet a Fatui Electrohammer Vanguard on Minacious Isle who keeps going on about an insignia. It seems that you won't be able to get through to him... But if you find some way to bring him back to his senses, perhaps you might be able to figure out why he is here.
 See you...
 Some amorphous man-eating monster?
 Some kind of horrifyingly warped trap?
 That insignia...
Chevka: You mean you think it's strange that I'm so familiar with an insignia that is not even mine...?
Chevka: Well, that badge belongs to Yakov. He went on this mission once together with his father, but he came back alone.
Chevka: He got that insignia after that mission... I envied the honor he won so much that I wound up borrowing it many times. Just to have a look.
 That's right. That's (Traveler) to you!
 The experiment is kaput, duh.
 Why did you all come to the Archipelago...
Chevka: We came here to complete our glorious mission, of course. But as for the details... I'll tell you more after we find Yakov...
 Why did you join the Fatui?
Chevka: Why... I joined the Fatui?
Chevka: Well, I did it to help realize the long-cherished wish of Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa... and to bring more honor to my family. I was raised to fight for the Tsaritsa.
 Yeah, let's show him that insignia...
 You're a Fatuus, you know...
(Approach the Mirror Maiden)
Paimon: Huh, there's Fatui on this island too. Could these people be "the other team" that Chevka was talking about earlier?
Paimon: Let's go check it out, (Traveler).
(Talk to Chevka at the base camp) (Optional)
Chevka: *sigh*, what am I gonna do about Yakov... What, is there anything else, (Traveler)?
 Why did you join the Fatui?
Chevka: Why... I joined the Fatui?
Chevka: Well, I did it to help realize the long-cherished wish of Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa... and to bring more honor to my family. I was raised to fight for the Tsaritsa.
 About Yakov...
Chevka: *sigh* It seems that Yakov is still delirious...
 It's nothing.
(Talk to Yakov at the base camp) (Optional)
Yakov: Why... Why did you leave me alone, Father... Why...
 (He still doesn't seem to be in his right mind...)
Chevka: *sigh* It seems that Yakov is still delirious...
Chevka: *sigh*, what am I gonna do about Yakov... What, is there anything else, (Traveler)?
Chevka: *sigh*... Agafya would be crazy mad at me if she saw Yakov like this... But I've got to bring Yakov back no matter what!
Chevka: *sigh*... Though he's younger than me, he'd earned more honors than I. Maybe I was... I guess I was jealous of him. I didn't even know how to get along with him. The only example I could draw from...
Chevka: And... Oh yes. We... we were part of the team assigned by Researcher Persikov to conduct signal tests here.
Chevka: Have you found a way to open the device? I mean, I'm not rushing you or anything, but... Why, is there something wrong?
Chevka: He got that insignia after that mission... I envied the honor he won so much that I wound up borrowing it many times. Just to have a look.
Chevka: He got this badge for completing an emergency mission together with his father, but his father never returned...
Chevka: His mother passed away when he was born... So after losing his father, he was then all alone in the world.
Chevka: Hmm... No, it's nothing, really.
Chevka: How did it go? Have you found Yakov?
Chevka: Huh, so there was an island like this there. How strange...
Chevka: I don't remember this being here the last time when we were investigating earlier...
Chevka: I've heard that one of the Lord Harbingers has learned in Sumeru that we can connect people's minds with the help of certain technologies, and that the impact of such technologies could cover an entire region...
Chevka: I... I always thought that honors were all that mattered to him. But no, I was wrong. That was just "what I thought he valued"...
Chevka: If this won't bring him back to us, then what in the world does he want...
Chevka: If you can open it and help me find Yakov, I will tell you anything you want... Well, I will not speak ill of the Lord Harbingers regardless.
Chevka: It was my fault in the first place that Yakov was... And some things are more important than so-called principles or instructions... That's what I think, anyway.
Chevka: It's an honor you earned together with your father, and now it's back in your hands... What do you say, Yakov? C'mon, man, wake up already...
Chevka: My name is Chevka. I was carrying out signal testing work for the machine... Huh, my memory about it is a bit blurry. Anyway, I remember that we came all the way to this island...
Chevka: Oh right, that insignia...
Chevka: Oh, so you've met them, have you...
Chevka: Oh, yeah, and I was with Yakov. We got into a fight, and that's why he threw the insignia away.
Chevka: Oh. Um. Sorry.
Chevka: Our base camp is on an island in the center of the sea. Yakov is still delirious, so I must send him there first.
Chevka: Speaking of which, I wonder how those experiments are going...
Chevka: That how it is? Haha, then I guess Researcher Persikov's gonna have to pay that toll.
Chevka: That's all I know. I made arrangements with the other team members that we'd go back to our base camp in the center of the sea once we finished testing...
Chevka: That's all I know. I made arrangements with the other team members that we'd go back to our base camp in the center of the sea once we finished testing...
Chevka: They should be somewhere on the two islands in the north... According to our mission progress, they're probably on the northwestern island...
Chevka: *sigh*... Agafya would be crazy mad at me if she saw Yakov like this... But I've got to bring Yakov back no matter what!
Chevka: That's right. I've got to find Yakov. I've got to! Yakovâ€”!
Chevka: That's what I hoped, anyway, and that's how I wound up looking for a way to reunite with him here. But then there was a buzzing sound, and my mind suddenly went blank. That's how I got into the state you saw me in earlier.
Chevka: Then... I saw him walking into something really abnormal and disappear along with... whatever that abnormality was. Um, this doesn't mean that I'll never see him again, right?
Chevka: They should be somewhere on the two islands in the north... According to our mission progress, they're probably on the northwestern island...
Chevka: Things weren't looking all that promising, but Researcher Persikov decided to go ahead with these experiments anyway, and we were assigned to go out to sea and carry out signal tests in various places for this machine of ours...
Chevka: Wait. You... You can open those...?
Chevka: We came here to complete our glorious mission, of course. But as for the details... I'll tell you more after we find Yakov...
Chevka: Well, I did it to help realize the long-cherished wish of Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa... and to bring more honor to my family. I was raised to fight for the Tsaritsa.
Chevka: Well, that badge belongs to Yakov. He went on this mission once together with his father, but he came back alone.
Chevka: Well, this is kind of embarrassing... But you guessed it.
Chevka: What happened back there? I... don't really understand.
Chevka: Why... I joined the Fatui?
Chevka: Yakov, Yakov, wake up! What happened to you...
Chevka: Yakov, look! This is your insignia. You threw it away earlier, but it's been found...
Chevka: You mean you think it's strange that I'm so familiar with an insignia that is not even mine...?
Electrohammer Vanguard: ...
Electrohammer Vanguard: ...No, wait. You're (Traveler) and Paimon!
Electrohammer Vanguard: I gotta find the insignia... That's the only way...
Electrohammer Vanguard: I see. So you found it on the beach, eh... Heh, so it was found at last. Thank you both so much. I'm lucky to have met people as kind as you are.
Electrohammer Vanguard: I... I see. Now that I'm at your mercy, there's not much I can do.
Electrohammer Vanguard: It's all my fault... I'm the reason he became like that...
Electrohammer Vanguard: Just do what I wish and tell you everything!
Electrohammer Vanguard: My father once told me that "giving information to the enemy is no different from betrayal. Our family raises no traitors!"
Electrohammer Vanguard: My father once told me that "if you have fallen into enemy hands, it is a better option to sacrifice yourself for the honor of your family."
Electrohammer Vanguard: No, I need to... bring the insignia back to him... I've got to find it...
Electrohammer Vanguard: Oh right. Yakov threw it down back then, didn't he...
Electrohammer Vanguard: So I have decided to...
Electrohammer Vanguard: The insignia... The insignia...
Electrohammer Vanguard: This is... Yeah, this is the one. I remember every scratch on this insignia. Huh, there's a new dent here. Why's that?
Electrohammer Vanguard: To be honest, I'm so ashamed now that I want to cry!
Electrohammer Vanguard: To be honest, it is truly shameful that I have fallen into your hands and even had to accept your help. That's what my father's teachings say.
Electrohammer Vanguard: Yet, my father also told me that "When you receive a favor, you should return it." His words seem to contradict themselves in this situation.
Paimon: (Traveler), how should we deal with this guy?
Paimon: A thing that disappears with you once you walk into it? Is this some kind of Golden Apple Archipelago urban legend?
Paimon: Ah, you must be referring to the Fatui we met earlier!
Paimon: And Paimon's Paimon!
Paimon: Another group... and the other Fatui working alongside them, huh?
Paimon: Another group... and the other Fatui working alongside them, huh?
Paimon: This is kinda concerning. According to Chevka, we can find 'em near Broken Isle, so let's start our search there...
Paimon: Gah, he's completely ignoring us...
Paimon: Have decided to do what?
Paimon: He acts exactly like Agafya earlier, remember? She came to reason as soon as we gave her the pocket watch with a picture.
Paimon: Hey! What are you doing here?
Paimon: Hey, hey, didn't we tell you to relax? Stop yelling so loudly!
Paimon: Hey, what are you doing here?
Paimon: Huh, there's Fatui on this island too. Could these people be "the other team" that Chevka was talking about earlier?
Paimon: In which case, there might just be a way to re-open the way through them!
Paimon: It doesn't seem to have helped...
Paimon: It's pretty clear that he can't hear us. Speaking louder won't help at all...
Paimon: Let's go check it out, (Traveler).
Paimon: Maybe there is also something that can wake the Electrohammer Vanguard from the impact of the machine?
Paimon: Oh, so that's why that insignia was in such a weird spot.
Paimon: Oh, so this is where we've gone? Heh, Paimon was worried there for a moment.
Paimon: Okay, okay, we got it. Still, this isn't something to be proud of. You don't have to say it so loud.
Paimon: Right, Electrohammer Vanguards are pretty dangerous when they sprint at full tilt... Wait, no, that's not what Paimon was talking about!
Paimon: Right, the Fatui were also affected by the machine. But isn't there anything we can do to bring him back to his senses?
Paimon: Seems like he's looking for some kind of insignia... Guess we need to find it for him, (Traveler).
Paimon: Still, Paimon wonders what happened to leave him in this state...
Paimon: That's way too harsh.
Paimon: There's no need to be so nervous. This place is very safe. Now, (Traveler), let's go look for Yakov...
Paimon: This is kinda concerning. According to Chevka, we can find 'em near Broken Isle, so let's start our search there...
Paimon: This really isn't something that happens every day.
Paimon: To be honest, though, we were just curious about why you're here...
Paimon: Uh, Paimon thinks those might be a bit off the mark. But it might just be like those strange mechanized paths we've seen before.
Paimon: Wait, is the insignia we picked up on the beach the one he's muttering about? You know, the one that looks kinda shabby?
Paimon: We might as well show it to him, huh?
Paimon: Well, alright then. Let's give it a go, (Traveler)!
Paimon: Well, we are here, so the Fatui experiment...
Paimon: Well, you sure became easygoing super quick!
Paimon: Well... this does worry Paimon a little. Why is this Electrohammer Vanguard here? He isn't up to something bad, is he?
Paimon: What Paimon meant is... Shouldn't we, y'know, wake him up and ask him what he's doing here...?
Paimon: What is it, Chevka?
Paimon: What's that Fatui guy muttering about?
Paimon: What? That sounds horrible...
Paimon: Whoa, that was a quick decision. You almost made us feel like the villains here... Also, hang on, did you just forget your father's teachings altogether?
Paimon: Y'know, it somehow doesn't surprise Paimon that the two of you have problems...
Paimon: Yeah, we can, sure. But hey, why should we help you?
Paimon: Yeah. It's not every day we have a Fatuus here muttering about some insignia or whatever... It seems like he's looking for something.
Paimon: Yes, it seems that Yakov definitely came to this island as well.
Paimon: You don't know what he's looking for? Aren't you guys teammates?
Paimon: You got this from how your father treats you, didn't you...
Paimon: You were just like him earlier, you know, muttering on about that insignia!
Phonograph: (The gramophone is playing songs that bring back warm memories of the past...)
The Fatuus' clarity returns upon obtaining the insignia...
Yakov: Oh... why...
Yakov: Why... Why did you leave me alone, Father... Why...
Yakov: Why... Why... Why did you leave me alone...
