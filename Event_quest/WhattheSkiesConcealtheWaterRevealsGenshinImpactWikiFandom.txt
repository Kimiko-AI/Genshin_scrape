 A Harbinger? Goodness...
 Does the power to summon a meteorite strike really exist?
 Fischl, you're a good person
Media:vo eqast003 12 fischl 04b.ogg Fischl: Naturally!
 How can they all be having the same dream?
 I should be used to this by now, but...
 I take it Qingce Village has been affected, then.
 I'll cook a meal for you.
 It is the same ice-capped mountain in everyone's dream.
 Let's take a closer look.
(Quest completes)
 Mona, you're a good person.
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 11a.ogg Mona: ...Huh? Wh—What're you saying that for?
 Quest DescriptionApart from the spate of unconsciousness caused by the meteorites, the appearance of the Fatui has also aroused your suspicions. Fortunately, the arrival of the astrologist Mona has given your efforts a much-needed boost. With the help of her mystical scrying techniques, you begin to delve into these mysteries...
 Scaramouche, Balladeer — The Sixth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers 
 So it wasn't "you" who wanted to climb the mountain?
 The previous victims have said they were cold, too.
 The things you two say are not even remotely similar...
 Were you on a mountain?
Media:vo eqast003 9 gaothesix 04a.ogg Gao the Sixth: Yes... how did you know? Way up in the mountains, the highest mountain I have ever seen... It was freezing up there.
 Were you outside in the snow?
Media:vo eqast003 9 gaothesix 04b.ogg Gao the Sixth: Well, sort of. Up a snowy mountain, to be precise. It was huge, and it was freezing cold... The moment I fell asleep, I was standing at the foot of the mountain.
 What are your hungry for? Any dish you like.
(Talk to the Millelith soldier Jinglun)
Bro Huang: This has been a long shift... I'm getting hungry.
Check victim: The victim is still in deep sleep.
Gao the Sixth: Thanks to you, I didn't starve to death in my sleep!
Huaqing: Hey, who's that! ...Oh, you're the adventurers here to help out. Sorry. Your help is greatly appreciated.
Jinglun: I really hope you can help us deal with the meteorites.
Jinglun: Meteorites, can you believe it... First time for everything, I guess!
Media:vo eqast003 1 mona 01.ogg Mona: Ah, good timing! There's something i need you to do.
Media:vo eqast003 1 mona 02.ogg Mona: Remember how I was saying that the meteorites belonged to someone's constellation?
Media:vo eqast003 1 mona 03.ogg Mona: Theoretically, it's not possible for stars that are goodness knows how many light-years away to suddenly turn into meteors and fall out of the sky. But, however paradoxical it may be, this is the reality.
Media:vo eqast003 1 mona 04.ogg Mona: If we want to get to the bottom of this, the best way is to find out whose constellation it was.
Media:vo eqast003 1 mona 05.ogg Mona: Based on what you've told me, it seems that all victims of the meteorites fell into a deep sleep, and all of them dreamed of a snowy mountain.
Media:vo eqast003 1 mona 06.ogg Mona: Now, we may not know which mountain this was — but we can safely assume that it's not Dragonspine. Otherwise, someone would have recognized it, right?
Media:vo eqast003 1 mona 07.ogg Mona: Did everyone definitely have the same dream? And where exactly were they in the dream? These are the questions we need answers to.
Media:vo eqast003 1 mona 08.ogg Mona: I need you to find out more detailed about the sleepers' dreams. The more information we have, the closer we can get to the truth.
Media:vo eqast003 1 mona 09.ogg Mona: I need to stay in an undisturbed environment. So, I will leave the investigating to you.
Media:vo eqast003 1 oz 01.ogg Oz: There is Qingce Village, in Liyue... Although, it does not usually match your suggestion of "somewhere with lots of people around."
Media:vo eqast003 1 oz 02.ogg Oz: That said, I suspect that the Millelith will have turned that area into a site where victims can receive medical attention, much as they did at Wangshu Inn.
Media:vo eqast003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hi Mona! Thanks to you, we've managed to get rid of loads and loads of meteorites!
Media:vo eqast003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Seems we should head somewhere with lots of people around.
Media:vo eqast003 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: That way, we should be able to find more victims to question.
Media:vo eqast003 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Is there anywhere we haven't been to yet?
Media:vo eqast003 10 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: An ice-capped mountain looms over the world from far above the clouds... That is the place from which this burgeoning darkness proceeds.
Media:vo eqast003 10 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: Perchance some poor soul lies there, buried in the snow, hounded to death on the mountain?
Media:vo eqast003 10 mona 01.ogg Mona: Ice-capped mountain? Is that all?
Media:vo eqast003 10 mona 02.ogg Mona: Climb the mountain? To the summit?
Media:vo eqast003 10 mona 03.ogg Mona: What sort of person would wish to reach the summit of that mountain? And how is their desire strong enough to exert an influence on others?
Media:vo eqast003 10 mona 04.ogg Mona: I'll do another reading!
(Mona's idle animation plays)
Media:vo eqast003 10 mona 05.ogg Mona: Aha! I see something here... It's a little vague but I think I can get his name... Ah, yes! "Leonard"!
Media:vo eqast003 10 mona 06.ogg Mona: Well, in case you'd forgotten... I am a genius!
Media:vo eqast003 10 oz 01.ogg Oz: Or... Some intrepid explorer was exceptionally keen to conquer that particular mountain.
Media:vo eqast003 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Mona! We found some stuff out!
Media:vo eqast003 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's a really really high mountain that no one's ever seen before, and it's super cold up there. The sleepers are forced to try and climb to the summit, but they don't know why.
Media:vo eqast003 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wow, that was fast!
Media:vo eqast003 10 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: "Leonard..." Paimon's never heard that name before.
(Cutscene, the vagrant from Inazuma walks in on the scene)
Media:vo eqast003 12 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Ozvaldo Hrafnavines, what is thy opinion?
Media:vo eqast003 12 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: So long as they can afford to pay the price, they will never stop sowing their seeds of destruction across the land... Fatui, your sins shall not go unremembered.
Media:vo eqast003 12 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: Astral emissary, you have performed admirably as a member of my retinue. I will dispatch my forces to protect you, and they will ensure that the encroaching darkness shall bring you no harm.
Media:vo eqast003 12 fischl 04b.ogg Fischl: Naturally!
Media:vo eqast003 12 fischl 05.ogg Fischl: The very heart of darkness descends upon the world.
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 01.ogg Mona: Any junior fortune-teller could have told you this, but... That man was a Fatui Harbinger! That was too close, how did you manage to get caught up with a guy like him?
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 02.ogg Mona: Whatever he was planning to do... He was heading straight for you.
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 03.ogg Mona: And he is an extremely powerful individual! I sensed it the moment I looked at him. He's far more powerful than you'd imagine.
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 04.ogg Mona: As much as it pains me to admit it...
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 05.ogg Mona: I never said that...! His strength may exceed mine by a hair's breadth... But in astrology alone, he doesn't come close!
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 06.ogg Mona: They must be plotting something.
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 07.ogg Mona: Hmm.. Maybe, just maybe...
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 08.ogg Mona: Paimon, that was my line! Get your own!
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 09.ogg Mona: You underestimate me, Fischl! I'm far stronger than you seem to think.
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 10.ogg Mona: There's really no need. In any case, you're in a much more perilous position than I am. If anything, you need my protection.
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 11a.ogg Mona: ...Huh? Wh—What're you saying that for?
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 12.ogg Mona: For now, we must deal with the new threat. My astrolabe tells me that a new meteorite has landed, and it's the biggest one yet.
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 13.ogg Mona: Looks like we made it here before the Fatui. There's no time to lose!
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 14.ogg Mona: This is the one.
Media:vo eqast003 12 mona 15.ogg Mona: It's possible... But if that were the case, other life forms would surely be drawn to the meteorites' energy too.
Media:vo eqast003 12 oz 01.ogg Oz: A Fatui Harbinger? Why, their wickedness knows no bounds!
Media:vo eqast003 12 oz 02.ogg Oz: Surely his power cannot match that of the astrological genius of the century?
Media:vo eqast003 12 oz 03.ogg Oz: I think that anything is possible, mein Fräulein.
Media:vo eqast003 12 oz 04.ogg Oz: I also believe that miracles can happen.
Media:vo eqast003 12 oz 05.ogg Oz: She means me.
Media:vo eqast003 12 oz 06.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein trusts no one more than yourself, my lady, she is simply concerned for your well-being.
Media:vo eqast003 12 oz 07.ogg Oz: I sense an unprecedented amount of elemental energy within.
Media:vo eqast003 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: This reminds Paimon of something... We ran into some Fatui at Wangshu Inn, too!
Media:vo eqast003 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What interest could the Fatui have in the meteorites?
Media:vo eqast003 12 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh! The Fatui are the ones who caused the meteor shower in the first place! Was that it?
Media:vo eqast003 12 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Sorry... Paimon's mouth just works so much faster than everyone else's.
Media:vo eqast003 12 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Yeah... Where'd they get the power to pull stars out of the sky!?
Media:vo eqast003 12 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: No need! Paimon thinks that our current lineup works just fine.. No need to fix it if it ain't broke!
Media:vo eqast003 12 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: What do the Fatui want with this? Is it the elemental power?
Media:vo eqast003 3 jinglun 01.ogg Jinglun: Adventurers! Perfect! I was beginning to despair at the lack of helpers.
Media:vo eqast003 3 jinglun 02.ogg Jinglun: These meteorites have been going on for days now. Don't even get me started on how much trouble it's caused.
Media:vo eqast003 3 jinglun 03.ogg Jinglun: If one lands in a field, no one dares to go and harvest the crops, and if one lands at the entrance, access is a complete nightmare.
Media:vo eqast003 3 jinglun 04.ogg Jinglun: Do you have any ideas on how to safely dispose of them? They're just making everything impossible!
Media:vo eqast003 3 jinglun 05.ogg Jinglun: Wonderful! What a huge help!
Media:vo eqast003 3 jinglun 06.ogg Jinglun: Oh, I wouldn't know... You're better off just taking a look for yourself.
Media:vo eqast003 3 oz 01.ogg Oz: Have any of the victims woken since the start of the incident?
Media:vo eqast003 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hello, we're from the Adventurers' Guild. Can you tell us if Qingce Village has been affected by the meteorite strike?
Media:vo eqast003 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Guess we'd better help this guy out.
Media:vo eqast003 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Done and dusted!
Media:vo eqast003 6 brotherhuang 01.ogg Bro Huang: Funny you ask! Gao the Sixth literally just woke up.
Media:vo eqast003 6 brotherhuang 02.ogg Bro Huang: That's fine, but he's only just awoken and is still very weak. If you must question him, please be gentle.
(Cutscene to talking to Gao the Sixth)
Media:vo eqast003 6 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Mortal! Art thou also descended into the realm of suffering?
Media:vo eqast003 6 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: A wicked mountain, its frozen peak looming high, home to a malevolent power...
Media:vo eqast003 6 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: Greetings, you who have suffered and lived to tell the tale. Your sovereign shall question you now.
Media:vo eqast003 6 gaothesix 01.ogg Gao the Sixth: Food... Need food...
Media:vo eqast003 6 gaothesix 02.ogg Gao the Sixth: Ugh... Oof...
Media:vo eqast003 6 gaothesix 03.ogg Gao the Sixth: I need... home... home cooking...
Media:vo eqast003 6 huaqing 01.ogg Huaqing: No, he has said a few things in his sleep, though.
Media:vo eqast003 6 huaqing 02.ogg Huaqing: "So cold," "Can't go on," ...Things like that.
Media:vo eqast003 6 oz 01.ogg Oz: Somewhere cold, up in the mountains... Where could it be?
Media:vo eqast003 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Same situation that we've seen in other places, too.
Media:vo eqast003 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hey there. Has this guy woken up at any point?
Media:vo eqast003 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What kind of things?
Media:vo eqast003 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hey, has this guy woken up at any point?
Media:vo eqast003 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Okay... Um, has he said anything in his sleep?
Media:vo eqast003 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: How high? High as a snowy mountain peak, maybe?
Media:vo eqast003 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Let's talk to that guy over there next.
Media:vo eqast003 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Hello, have any of the victims woken up?
Media:vo eqast003 6 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Alright! We're gonna go talk to him.
Media:vo eqast003 6 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Are you okay? Sounds like you're starving.
Media:vo eqast003 6 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Home cooking from Qingce Village? Well that can only mean one thing: farmer food!
Media:vo eqast003 6 yang 01.ogg Yang: Not so far.
Media:vo eqast003 6 yang 02.ogg Yang: Now that you mention it... Yesterday, he suddenly cried out "So high!" Who knows what he was dreaming about.
Media:vo eqast003 9 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: An intruder trespassed in the dark recesses of your soul!?
Media:vo eqast003 9 gaothesix 01.ogg Gao the Sixth: Food... Need food...
(Opens food menu, can offer Qingce Stir Fry or Delicious Qingce Stir Fry)
Media:vo eqast003 9 gaothesix 02.ogg Gao the Sixth: Phwoar! That's brought me back from the brink, that has!
Media:vo eqast003 9 gaothesix 03.ogg Gao the Sixth: Only the most exhausting dream of my whole life!
Media:vo eqast003 9 gaothesix 04a.ogg Gao the Sixth: Yes... how did you know? Way up in the mountains, the highest mountain I have ever seen... It was freezing up there.
Media:vo eqast003 9 gaothesix 04b.ogg Gao the Sixth: Well, sort of. Up a snowy mountain, to be precise. It was huge, and it was freezing cold... The moment I fell asleep, I was standing at the foot of the mountain.
Media:vo eqast003 9 gaothesix 05.ogg Gao the Sixth: I'm not sure. It's like I was... possessed. I was consumed by the idea of climbing up the mountain and trying to reach the summit.
Media:vo eqast003 9 gaothesix 06.ogg Gao the Sixth: Who knows? Honestly, it's like I became a completely different person in my dream. Don't ask me why, I have no idea...
Media:vo eqast003 9 gaothesix 07.ogg Gao the Sixth: It's hard to describe.... It's like I was being controlled, as if somebody else put the idea of climbing the mountain into my head. I know how crazy that sounds, but...
Media:vo eqast003 9 oz 01.ogg Oz: An idea not autonomously generated by the individual, but that appeared within the subconscious... Yes, the signs do indeed point towards mind control.
Media:vo eqast003 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Darn it! We must've cooked it wrong...
Media:vo eqast003 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Did you have a dream while you were sleeping?
Media:vo eqast003 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Really? Why, what happened?
Media:vo eqast003 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: What were you doing there?
Media:vo eqast003 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Was there something special at the summit, or?
Media:vo eqast003 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: All the other victims we've met have talked about being cold, and needing to rest... Were they all climbing the mountain, too?
Media:vo eqast003 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Paimon doesn't even wanna think about it... We need to update Mona on all of this!
Media:vo eqast003 cs agent walla 01.ogg Media:vo eqast003 cs fatuusa walla 01.ogg Media:vo eqast003 cs summoner walla 01.ogg Fatui Soldiers: Sir!
Media:vo eqast003 cs fatuusa 01.ogg Male Fatui Soldier: My Lord!

Media:vo eqast003 cs fischl 01.ogg Fischl: What ho! We meet again, vagrant of Inazuma.
(Mona realizes something)
Media:vo eqast003 cs fischl 02.ogg Fischl: My retinue and I were just—
(Mona creates a Hydro bubble and teleports the team away)
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 01.ogg ???: Hi!
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 02.ogg ???: Sounds interesting... Mind if I join you?
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 03.ogg ???: The first time, the Millelith were present
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 04.ogg ???: I had to forego the chance to strike down Mondstadt's savior.
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 05.ogg ???: This time was the perfect moment... I was mere seconds away...
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 06.ogg Scaramouche: (But who was that mage? She could not have known who I am)
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 07.ogg Scaramouche: (Perhaps her powers reveal to her things unseen?)
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 08.ogg Scaramouche: Soldiers!
(Fatui soldiers are summoned, kneeling)
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 09.ogg Scaramouche: Find them. And when you do...
(A large meteorite passes by)
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 10.ogg Scaramouche: Another one?
(A female Fatui soldier enters the scene)
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 11.ogg Scaramouche: They just keep coming
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 12.ogg Scaramouche: But so be it
(Scaramouche addresses the soldiers)
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 13.ogg Scaramouche: Move out! Change of plan, your prior objective remains in force
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 14.ogg Scaramouche: Continue to research the meteorites
(A male Fatui soldier stands up)
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 15.ogg Scaramouche: Are you deaf, or just stupid?
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 16.ogg Scaramouche: When did I give you the right... to issue your own orders?
(Scaramouche gets visibly angry, the Fatui soldier stands down)
Media:vo eqast003 cs scaramouche 17.ogg Scaramouche: Now, move out, and complete your objectives as assigned.
(The Fatui soldiers leave the scene, Scaramouche looks back at the meteorite)
Yang: Something about watching these people sleeping is making me sleepy, too... Ahem! No, I would never sleep on the job!
