Aratani's Message: "When I first heard that someone wanted to rent Ms. Hina's advertising board, I refused. But the offer was very generous, so I thought I'd at least pay a visit to the site first."
Aratani's Message: "The moment I arrived at the venue, I was deeply touched. Even with such a tight budget and a miserable venue..."
Aratani's Message: "...the organizers still managed to reserve enough budget for Ms. Hina. Surely, this is true love? I signed the rental contract immediately."
 Hold on, I'm not ready yet...
Media:vo tips dialog mug003 genta 03d.ogg Genta: No problem. Just let me know when you're ready.
 Hold on, about Arataki Itto...
Media:vo tips dialog mug003 genta 03c 1.ogg Genta: You wanna know when Boss is getting back? Sorry, I have no idea.
Media:vo tips dialog mug003 genta 03c 2.ogg Genta: What I do know is that the boss and Shinobu both see this festival as a major event, so they hope to get as many people to come as possible. That's why they're out there working hard to promote it.
Media:vo tips dialog mug003 genta 03c 3.ogg Genta: They said this will improve the image of the Arataki Gang, but I wouldn't know anything about that kind of thing.
Media:vo tips dialog mug003 genta 03c 4.ogg Genta: Still, I think he'll be back to see you before it's over.
Media:vo tips dialog mug003 genta 03c 5.ogg Genta: After all, he respects you a lot.
 Hold on, about that drum...
Media:vo tips dialog mug003 genta 03b 1.ogg Genta: You noticed it too, huh? Yeah, I noticed almost straight away that something wasn't quite right.
Media:vo tips dialog mug003 genta 03b 2.ogg Genta: It looks exactly like the kind of toy drum I'd buy from street peddlers as a kid! I remember they only cost around 800 Mora back then.
Media:vo tips dialog mug003 genta 03b 3.ogg Genta: Times change, I guess, but still. 80 grand is way too expensive.
Media:vo tips dialog mug003 genta 03b 4.ogg Genta: The boss definitely got scammed, no question.
Media:vo tips dialog mug003 genta 03b 5.ogg Genta: But whaddya gonna do? He's still the boss.

Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14b 2.ogg Arataki Itto: Yeah, I hesitated, but... I sent her an invitation.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14b 3.ogg Arataki Itto: I cannot believe how ungrateful she is. Get this — she came all the way out here just to put up a bulletin board and write a load of baloney on it, claiming that visitors need to be cautioned.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14b 4.ogg Arataki Itto: She even warned us not to change it. It's blatant bullying of the gang, that's what it is...
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14b 5.ogg Arataki Itto: One day, I'm gonna defeat that tengu fair and square, in broad daylight, in the middle of the street! She'll get what's coming to her!

Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14c 1.ogg Arataki Itto: The owner of Naganohara Fireworks?
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14c 2.ogg Arataki Itto: Chatting with her is a real blast. She only found out about our festival because she happened to be delivering some fireworks to Amakane Island.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14c 3.ogg Arataki Itto: She really liked what we're trying to do here, and came to pass on her best wishes. She even said she'll provide some fireworks for us next time.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14c 4.ogg Arataki Itto: Looks like the Arataki Gang should make sure to keep good ties with Naganohara Fireworks in the future.

Media:vo tips dialog mug003 mamoru 09b 2.ogg Mamoru: You can punch me in the gut, but I won't give up! Just like the boss says!
 Isn't there supposed to be a festival soon?
 It's alright, nothing special.
 It's not that great.
 It's okay, I'm just passing by.
Media:vo tips dialog mug003 genta 05b.ogg Genta: *sigh* What a pity. I wanted to see your performance again.

 What's this festival got in store for us?
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 1.ogg Arataki Itto: Hahahaha! A ton of totally awesome stuff!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 2.ogg Arataki Itto: See that hill over there? That's Singalong Hill. Stand at the top, look out over the sea, and sing your heart out.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 3.ogg Arataki Itto: And this bonfire, it's perfect for roasting Lavender Melons, the regular kind or the ones of the annoying little floating variety.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 4.ogg Arataki Itto: And these boxes. Plenty of space whether you wanna play Genius Invokation TCG or a-battle some beetles.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 06a 1.ogg Paimon: Wow, you really pulled out all the stops.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 5.ogg Arataki Itto: But of course, the highlight of this festival is the Drumalong. Here, feast your eyes on this.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 6.ogg Arataki Itto: Just between you and me, this little treasure was sourced through a top-secret channel. They said it's a prized hand drum that once belonged to a renowned onmyouji, and it's worth 8 million Mora!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 7.ogg Arataki Itto: Thanks to my strapping good looks and the fact that the vendor and I kinda had a connection — her words, not mine — she gave me a generous discount, and only asked for 800 thousand Mora.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 06a 2.ogg Paimon: She went from 8 million to 800 thousand just like that? Uh... sounds suspiciously like a scam to Paimon.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 8.ogg Arataki Itto: Duh, haha! Oldest trick in the book, right? Which is why it didn't work on me.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 9.ogg Arataki Itto: I spotted the damage on the edge right away. Practically screamed "defective product alert"! "Ooh, we have a connection"... Gimme a break!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 10.ogg Arataki Itto: So I haggled hard and took her down to 80 G's, hahahaha! Practically a steal!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 06a 3.ogg Paimon: Yeah... more specifically, daylight robbery...
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 06a 4.ogg Paimon: Still, it's pretty impressive that you could actually afford something worth 80 thousand Mora. Good for you, Bull-Chucker.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 11.ogg Arataki Itto: Pfft, it's only 80 thousand Mora. What do you take me for!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 genta 04a.ogg Genta: I put in 20 grand...
Media:vo tips mug003 6 mamoru 04a.ogg Mamoru: Me too...
Media:vo tips mug003 6 akira 04a.ogg Akira: Huh? Boss, how come I had to pay 30 grand?
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 06a 5.ogg Paimon: 20 grand plus 20 grand plus 30 grand...
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 06a 6.ogg Paimon: Ugh, you really are a bull-chucker! You extorted 80 grand from your gang members and didn't pay a single Mora yourself!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 12.ogg Arataki Itto: Ahem, you might wanna check your mathematics there! I paid my share... y'know, I paid the last 10 grand!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 15.ogg Arataki Itto: Alright, good chat, but we should wrap things up. It's getting late, I should go rendezvous with Shinobu.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 16.ogg Arataki Itto: This festival's just getting started. We need to keep plugging it to get a bigger crowd!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 17.ogg Arataki Itto: Take care of the hand drum, alright? Oh, and if you wanna try out the Drumalong at any point, Genta's your guy.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 18.ogg Arataki Itto: Laters, compadre!

Media:vo tips dialog mug003 genta 05a 2.ogg Genta: Ooh, I know! Since it's you, we can say we're friends hanging out and having fun.
Media:vo tips dialog mug003 genta 05a 3.ogg Genta: The Tenryou Commission won't be able to say anything against that, hahahaha!
Media:vo tips dialog mug003 genta 05a 4.ogg Genta: This is a pretty genius idea, isn't it? I mean, at least half as genius as Boss's ideas?

Media:vo tips mug003 3 kimura 09.ogg Kimura: Their leader claimed to be hosting a grand event, big enough to rival the Irodori Festival. I think that must be the one you're talking about.
Media:vo tips mug003 3 kimura 10.ogg Kimura: I asked them a couple of questions and it quickly became clear that they had no permit to host the event, no proof of venue hire, and — surprise, surprise — no record of having registered the event with the Police Station.
Media:vo tips mug003 3 kimura 11.ogg Kimura: Pff. If that isn't the definition of an unauthorized, unprofessional, and unofficial festival, I don't know what is. According to the rules, we had to force them to shut down the event.
Media:vo tips mug003 3 kimura 12.ogg Kimura: No, actually. Seeing that they had no prior experience organizing events, and they'd at least gone to the trouble of preparing a safety plan, we just gave them a warning.
Media:vo tips mug003 3 kimura 13.ogg Kimura: Anyway, if you are looking for the Arataki Gang, you could try going to Amakane Island.
Media:vo tips mug003 3 kimura 14.ogg Kimura: Which is a venue designated by the Yashiro Commission for use in all kinds of festivals, big and small. It was established to try and encourage community cultural events. The application process is much simpler there, and less expensive, too.
Media:vo tips mug003 3 kimura 15.ogg Kimura: We told the Arataki Gang about that.
Media:vo tips mug003 3 kimura 16.ogg Kimura: If they still want to host their event, that's gonna be their best option.
Media:vo tips mug003 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's the Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival, organized by the Arataki Gang!
Media:vo tips mug003 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What? No, no, no, it's not un-anything! It's the Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival!
Media:vo tips mug003 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What? You shut it down!? ...Let Paimon guess, then you arrested them, hmm?
Media:vo tips mug003 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Safety plan? Huh, that's pretty responsible...
Media:vo tips mug003 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hmm... this whole thing is starting to sound like a non-starter, (Traveler)...
Media:vo tips mug003 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: But, since we've come this far... we might as well go and take a look at Amakane Island, right?
Media:vo tips mug003 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Same situation as earlier. The Arataki Gang is nowhere in sight.
Media:vo tips mug003 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: There should be a Yashiro Commission representative here. Let's go and ask him.
Media:vo tips mug003 5 hirohiko 01.ogg Hirohiko: How can I help?
Media:vo tips mug003 5 hirohiko 02.ogg Hirohiko: Ah yes, you must be here for the Almighty Arataki Whatchamacallit Festival, too?
Media:vo tips mug003 5 hirohiko 03.ogg Hirohiko: Yep, Madam Kujou Sara of the Tenryou Commission and Yoimiya of Naganohara Fireworks have both been here so far.
Media:vo tips mug003 5 hirohiko 04.ogg Hirohiko: Yoimiya noticed them getting the venue ready when she was here to deliver some fireworks. I guess she got curious and went to go check it out.
Media:vo tips mug003 5 hirohiko 05.ogg Hirohiko: As to what Madam Kujou Sara was here for, I'm not quite sure.
Media:vo tips mug003 5 hirohiko 06.ogg Hirohiko: Unfortunately, since there's no space available at any official venues at the moment...
Media:vo tips mug003 5 hirohiko 07.ogg Hirohiko: ...we had to allocate them to a tiny beach at the northwest part of the island.
Media:vo tips mug003 5 hirohiko 08.ogg Hirohiko: If only they'd applied earlier, we could've given them a better location.
Media:vo tips mug003 5 hirohiko 09.ogg Hirohiko: Head northwest, you'll see them.
Media:vo tips mug003 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa, so other people got here before us? That's a good sign, (Traveler), hehe.
Media:vo tips mug003 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So where's the Arataki Gang now?
Media:vo tips mug003 6 akira 01.ogg Akira: The venue is situated against the backdrop of Amakane Island, where you can enjoy exclusive access to the Festival and Culture Center's first-rate equipment.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 akira 02.ogg Akira: And last but not least, it makes up for all the previous team building events that were canceled due to insufficient funding.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 akira 03.ogg Akira: Until then, he was out there with Shinobu working hard to bring more people to the festival.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 akira 04a.ogg Akira: Huh? Boss, how come I had to pay 30 grand?
Media:vo tips mug003 6 genta 01.ogg Genta: With excellent transport links by sea and lands, getting where you need to be is highly convenient — whether you're traveling by foot or by boat.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 genta 02.ogg Genta: Yeah, Boss said the first goal of the festival is to promote the Arataki Gang and recruit new members.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 genta 03.ogg Genta: Boss actually just got back.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 genta 04a.ogg Genta: I put in 20 grand...
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Hahahahaha! Hey there, compadres! You finally made it!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 02.ogg Arataki Itto: I was just wondering when you'd be showing up, next thing I know, boom. There you are. Hahaha, boy, am I happy to see you.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 03.ogg Arataki Itto: Look at this venue. What do you think? Is this a prime location or what?
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 04.ogg Arataki Itto: The moment I set eyes on this venue, I knew this was the one!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 05.ogg Arataki Itto: It was the moment that changed the world.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 06.ogg Arataki Itto: Ahem... alright, let's get down to business.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 07.ogg Arataki Itto: I invited you all here to attend the Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival! A highly important festival, I might add.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 08.ogg Arataki Itto: Akira... we can leave that last point out from now on.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 09.ogg Arataki Itto: The thing with festivals is, you gotta get out there and promote them far and wide if you want to get a good crowd. So Shinobu's handing out flyers.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 10.ogg Arataki Itto: Hey, I'm hard at work too! I'm, uh... entertaining guests!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 11.ogg Arataki Itto: Just—Just doin' my duty. Nothin' more, nothin' less.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 12.ogg Arataki Itto: Hmph, trust a puny little flying Lavender Melon to stoop to the level of childish name-calling!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 13.ogg Arataki Itto: Anyway, so, compadre — you got any questions about this festival?
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 1.ogg Arataki Itto: Hahahaha! A ton of totally awesome stuff!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 10.ogg Arataki Itto: So I haggled hard and took her down to 80 G's, hahahaha! Practically a steal!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 11.ogg Arataki Itto: Pfft, it's only 80 thousand Mora. What do you take me for!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 12.ogg Arataki Itto: Ahem, you might wanna check your mathematics there! I paid my share... y'know, I paid the last 10 grand!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 2.ogg Arataki Itto: See that hill over there? That's Singalong Hill. Stand at the top, look out over the sea, and sing your heart out.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 3.ogg Arataki Itto: And this bonfire, it's perfect for roasting Lavender Melons, the regular kind or the ones of the annoying little floating variety.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 4.ogg Arataki Itto: And these boxes. Plenty of space whether you wanna play Genius Invokation TCG or a-battle some beetles.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 5.ogg Arataki Itto: But of course, the highlight of this festival is the Drumalong. Here, feast your eyes on this.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 6.ogg Arataki Itto: Just between you and me, this little treasure was sourced through a top-secret channel. They said it's a prized hand drum that once belonged to a renowned onmyouji, and it's worth 8 million Mora!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 7.ogg Arataki Itto: Thanks to my strapping good looks and the fact that the vendor and I kinda had a connection — her words, not mine — she gave me a generous discount, and only asked for 800 thousand Mora.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 8.ogg Arataki Itto: Duh, haha! Oldest trick in the book, right? Which is why it didn't work on me.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14a 9.ogg Arataki Itto: I spotted the damage on the edge right away. Practically screamed "defective product alert"! "Ooh, we have a connection"... Gimme a break!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14b 1.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh, you mean that stupid tengu?
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14b 2.ogg Arataki Itto: Yeah, I hesitated, but... I sent her an invitation.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14b 3.ogg Arataki Itto: I cannot believe how ungrateful she is. Get this — she came all the way out here just to put up a bulletin board and write a load of baloney on it, claiming that visitors need to be cautioned.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14b 4.ogg Arataki Itto: She even warned us not to change it. It's blatant bullying of the gang, that's what it is...
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14b 5.ogg Arataki Itto: One day, I'm gonna defeat that tengu fair and square, in broad daylight, in the middle of the street! She'll get what's coming to her!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14c 1.ogg Arataki Itto: The owner of Naganohara Fireworks?
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14c 2.ogg Arataki Itto: Chatting with her is a real blast. She only found out about our festival because she happened to be delivering some fireworks to Amakane Island.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14c 3.ogg Arataki Itto: She really liked what we're trying to do here, and came to pass on her best wishes. She even said she'll provide some fireworks for us next time.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 14c 4.ogg Arataki Itto: Looks like the Arataki Gang should make sure to keep good ties with Naganohara Fireworks in the future.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 15.ogg Arataki Itto: Alright, good chat, but we should wrap things up. It's getting late, I should go rendezvous with Shinobu.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 16.ogg Arataki Itto: This festival's just getting started. We need to keep plugging it to get a bigger crowd!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 17.ogg Arataki Itto: Take care of the hand drum, alright? Oh, and if you wanna try out the Drumalong at any point, Genta's your guy.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 itto 18.ogg Arataki Itto: Laters, compadre!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 mamoru 01.ogg Mamoru: It's surrounded by sea, the air is as fresh as it gets, there's no noise pollution from the city, and the views are simply spectacular.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 mamoru 02.ogg Mamoru: Secondly, it's to celebrate Shinobu's graduation!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 mamoru 03.ogg Mamoru: He said he was expecting you to arrive any second, so he came back specially to welcome you.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 mamoru 04a.ogg Mamoru: Me too...
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Clearly, you're only here because the Tenryou Commission sent you away.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Three festivals in one, wow.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hey! Shinobu's supposed to be the star of the show, isn't she?
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: How come she's out there working her butt off while you're hanging around here doing nothing?
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Wow, this bull-chucker actually did some serious work for once. Paimon's pleasantly surprised.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 06a 1.ogg Paimon: Wow, you really pulled out all the stops.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 06a 2.ogg Paimon: She went from 8 million to 800 thousand just like that? Uh... sounds suspiciously like a scam to Paimon.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 06a 3.ogg Paimon: Yeah... more specifically, daylight robbery...
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 06a 4.ogg Paimon: Still, it's pretty impressive that you could actually afford something worth 80 thousand Mora. Good for you, Bull-Chucker.
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 06a 5.ogg Paimon: 20 grand plus 20 grand plus 30 grand...
Media:vo tips mug003 6 paimon 06a 6.ogg Paimon: Ugh, you really are a bull-chucker! You extorted 80 grand from your gang members and didn't pay a single Mora yourself!
Media:vo tips mug003 6 together 01.ogg Arataki Gang Members: Give it up for the boss!
Media:vo tips mug003 7 genta 01.ogg Genta: I'm Genta, the Arataki Drumalong Festival Welcome Ambassador. Are you ready for your Drumalong performance?
Media:vo tips mug003 7 genta 02.ogg Genta: Oh, I almost forgot, there's something that Boss forgot to mention to you about this hand drum.
Media:vo tips mug003 7 genta 03.ogg Genta: Since none of us really know if it's in tune or not, please test it out first.
Media:vo tips mug003 7 genta 04.ogg Genta: That way, it'll sound better when you deliver your final performance.
Media:vo tips mug003 7 genta 05.ogg Genta: Go on, give it a try.
