 About the title though...
 And like how we also call the best travel buddy "emergency food"...
 And like how we have a cavalry captain without a single horse...
 And now no one is going to save the kingdom.
 But she only wielded the sword for a brief moment towards the end?
 I can't believe someone would call himself world-famous.
 It was pretty interesting.
Media:vo xhwq001 2 leaderoftroupenocturnus 02a.ogg Twilight Theater Head: Terrific!
 Quest DescriptionThe great Prinzessin's loyal subjects are pleased to perform for you, our guests, a performance most special: a tale of love and valor...
 There's room for improvement.
Media:vo xhwq001 2 leaderoftroupenocturnus 02b.ogg Twilight Theater Head: Ah! Room for improvement... Let me write that down...
 They need to find someone to replace the guard who ran away.
 What...?
???: ...
Actor Playing Servant A: *cough* Wow, acting is pretty harsh on the throat. I barely speak this loudly ever as it is...
Actor Playing Servant B: You really saved me, (Traveler)! If you hadn't found a replacement, I'd have been done for!
Actor Playing Servant C: Well, so that's curtains, huh? Shame. I haven't had quite enough fun yet. It would be nice if we have the chance to do this again.
Actor Playing the "Princess": I didn't drag everyone down, did I?
Actor Playing the "Princess": I never thought I would have a chance to play the leading role...
Actor Playing the "Wicked Dragon": Hahaha! How was my acting? Pretty great, eh?
Actor Playing the "Wicked Dragon": What? I flubbed a line? Hah, impossible, you must have heard it wrong! I mean, that was all part of the act y'know?
Announcement Board: The much-awaited "Tale of the Sword-Wielding Princess" shall soon be staged. Please be patient!
Arnold: Ah, the stage seems so very lively. I wish I could go there, too...
Leon: I had quite a sizeable role this time. Honestly, I was worried that I would forget a line at some point the entire time!
Leon: There were some small incidents along the way, but all's well that ends well!

Media:vo xhwq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: You are...?
Media:vo xhwq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You say you're world-famous, but we've never heard of you.
Media:vo xhwq001 2 leaderoftroupenocturnus 01.ogg Twilight Theater Head: Paimon, (Traveler), what did you think? Please tell me your thoughts!
Media:vo xhwq001 2 leaderoftroupenocturnus 02a.ogg Twilight Theater Head: Terrific!

Media:vo xhwq001 4 leaderoftroupenocturnus 01.ogg Twilight Theater Head: *sob, sniff* ... The show was a resounding success...
Media:vo xhwq001 4 leaderoftroupenocturnus 02.ogg Twilight Theater Head: Our thanks to all of the actors and actresses, and our thanks to everyone who came to support us! Of course, we must thank you as well, (Traveler) and Paimon!
Media:vo xhwq001 4 leaderoftroupenocturnus 03.ogg Twilight Theater Head: I really appreciated your undivided attention... *sob*... It felt just like the relentlessly piercing gaze of the evil dragon...
Media:vo xhwq001 4 leaderoftroupenocturnus 04.ogg Twilight Theater Head: Oh yes, the title is 'Tale of the Sword-Wielding Princess'!
Media:vo xhwq001 4 leaderoftroupenocturnus 05.ogg Twilight Theater Head: Well... It's just like how The Five Kasen are usually portrayed in four poems...
Media:vo xhwq001 4 leaderoftroupenocturnus 06.ogg Twilight Theater Head: Well, anyway, the important thing is not the sword in the hand, but the courage in the heart!
Media:vo xhwq001 4 leaderoftroupenocturnus 07.ogg Twilight Theater Head: Back to business! Now that the curtains have closed, I would like to take this rare opportunity to invite (Traveler) and Paimon to take a photo with the crew!
Media:vo xhwq001 4 leaderoftroupenocturnus 08.ogg Twilight Theater Head: Please don't refuse! Come on!
Media:vo xhwq001 5 leaderoftroupenocturnus 01.ogg Twilight Theater Head: Is everyone ready? Three, two...
Media:vo xhwq001 5 leaderoftroupenocturnus 02.ogg Twilight Theater Head: One! Yay!
Media:vo xhwq001 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa! Tone down the excitement buddy!
Media:vo xhwq001 6 leaderoftroupenocturnus 01.ogg Twilight Theater Head: It's totally fine! A commemoration picture could always benefit from a dose of quirkiness!
Media:vo xhwq001 6 leaderoftroupenocturnus 02.ogg Twilight Theater Head: Thank you again, (Traveler) and Paimon!
Media:vo xhwq001 6 leaderoftroupenocturnus 03.ogg Twilight Theater Head: Ah! Summer! Wonderful summer! The good times never last... I wish times like this would be like a show that never ends...
Media:vo xhwq001 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Are you sure that... the photo is fine?
Media:vo xhwq001 7 arnold 01.ogg Arnold: Of course! How ridiculous! How could he waste such a great opportunity?
Media:vo xhwq001 7 arnold 02.ogg Arnold: If only it was me! I've always wanted to perform in a show, but I never got the chance...
Media:vo xhwq001 7 arnold 03.ogg Arnold: Well... I've seen them rehearse, but I'm still not a real actor...
Media:vo xhwq001 7 arnold 04.ogg Arnold: That's true... But...
Media:vo xhwq001 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What? Why did the guard run away? The show hasn't finished yet!
Media:vo xhwq001 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: The narrator said they'll have to find a replacement... shall we go look for one, (Traveler)?
Media:vo xhwq001 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ah! There is a real guard over there. Let's go and ask him.
Media:vo xhwq001 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Excuse me, did you see an actor running away...
Media:vo xhwq001 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Wait, isn't this just perfect?
Media:vo xhwq001 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: But you are a real guard!
Media:vo xhwq001 7 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: The other guy suddenly disappeared just as he got to "I am the last line of defense!"
Media:vo xhwq001 7 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: We can't let that stand!
Media:vo xhwq001 7 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: As a guard, isn't it also your duty to protect the audience's wish to enjoy the play?
Media:vo xhwq001 7 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: It's always been your dream to perform on a stage! People are waiting! There's no time to hesitate!
Media:vo xhwq001 7 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Let's bring him over, (Traveler)!
Media:vo yywq001 1 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: Upon hearing of human dreams precious as gold, an insatiable evil dragon descended upon the kingdom.
Media:vo yywq001 1 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: Oblivious to this ill, the king and his princess continued to debate the content of their meal.
Media:vo yywq001 1 narrator 03.ogg Narrator: Meat or vegetable — though the princess's most loyal servant would have proposed both to end the squabble.
Media:vo yywq001 1 narrator 04.ogg Narrator: But few knew his name, and fewer still cared for his counsel.
Media:vo yywq001 1 narrator 05.ogg Narrator: And then, the evil dragon appeared.
Media:vo yywq001 2 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: Dreams like gold... I wonder if they will be flavorful?
Media:vo yywq001 2 dragon 02.ogg Wicked Dragon: Phew. These uneven tiles on the ground knocked the wind out of my sails.
Media:vo yywq001 2 dragon 03.ogg Wicked Dragon: Ah! Good, very good! Though you are puny, you harbor dreams grand enough for myself!
Media:vo yywq001 2 dragon 04.ogg Wicked Dragon: "Evil dragon"? How laughable.
Media:vo yywq001 2 dragon 05.ogg Wicked Dragon: A dragon as illustrated and thoughtful as myself should surely be granted "enlightened" as a title.
Media:vo yywq001 2 dragon 06.ogg Wicked Dragon: My kin are known to covet treasure, yet I have found the dreams of puny man more enticing than jewels.
Media:vo yywq001 2 dragon 07.ogg Wicked Dragon: It is most spectacular how man can stuff their minds with dreams, whether they be starving or full.
Media:vo yywq001 2 dragon 08.ogg Wicked Dragon: Human dreams are more precious than gold, or so they say.
Media:vo yywq001 2 dragon 09.ogg Wicked Dragon: Today, I will see for myself if your dreams are indeed as filling as they are valuable.
Media:vo yywq001 2 dragon 10.ogg Wicked Dragon: My hunger wears away at my control, I must feast as soon as possible.
Media:vo yywq001 2 dragon 11.ogg Wicked Dragon: Puny king, if you value your own life and those of your kin, then offer up thy sacrifice thereupon!
Media:vo yywq001 2 dragon 12.ogg Wicked Dragon: I must urge that you reconsider, though courage fills your measly soul.
Media:vo yywq001 2 dragon 13.ogg Wicked Dragon: Which choice is more favorable between sacrifice and annihilation, some time will surely show.
Media:vo yywq001 2 dragon 14.ogg Wicked Dragon: Huff, I will find some rest in your city outskirts. But before nightfall, I will return for my fill.
Media:vo yywq001 2 dragon 15.ogg Wicked Dragon: If you fail to give, then I will take for myself. Your palace shall be my hunting grounds, and your halls my stove.
Media:vo yywq001 2 king 01.ogg King: Begone, evil dragon!
Media:vo yywq001 2 king 02.ogg King: To see me as a coward — are your vile eyes mere reflective stones?
Media:vo yywq001 2 king 03.ogg King: Dreams and nobility are my lifelong pursuits, I will not give them up for you.
Media:vo yywq001 2 king 04.ogg King: Be gone, evil dragon! The kingdom won't cower before you!
Media:vo yywq001 3 king 01.ogg King: My child! You forget yourself!
Media:vo yywq001 3 king 02.ogg King: A princess cannot march.
Media:vo yywq001 3 king 03.ogg King: Your place is not in battle, but within the boudoir.
Media:vo yywq001 3 king 04.ogg King: You are a princess first.
Media:vo yywq001 3 king 05.ogg King: Moreover, I cannot bear to see you step into danger.
Media:vo yywq001 3 king 06.ogg King: Furthermore, you...
Media:vo yywq001 3 king 07.ogg King: With no name or honor, how do you propose to protect her?
Media:vo yywq001 3 king 08.ogg King: Alas, say no more — I will summon the bravest warriors of the land to ride beside her.
Media:vo yywq001 3 loyalequerry 01.ogg Loyal Servant: Ahem! Rest assured, your Majesty, by my side, her safety will be secure.
Media:vo yywq001 3 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: Convinced that the king will in time provide a delicious meal, the hubristic dragon departed the castle for a short break.
Media:vo yywq001 3 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: The righteous King had no intention to yield, and planned to call upon his banners to conquer evil.
Media:vo yywq001 3 princess 01.ogg Princess: I will defeat the dragon to protect our kingdom.
Media:vo yywq001 3 princess 02.ogg Princess: I have not forgotten your teachings; I cannot give up dreams and nobility.
Media:vo yywq001 3 princess 03.ogg Princess: I should walk freely among our people, as a princess, but also as a warrior.
Media:vo yywq001 3 princess 04.ogg Princess: With the dragon outside, I cannot just sit still.
Media:vo yywq001 4 equerrya 01.ogg Servant A: You say you didn't know? Here, I'll tell you all about my name!
Media:vo yywq001 4 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: There were three celebrated warriors in the realm, each endowed with great gifts, and known for skills spectacular.
Media:vo yywq001 4 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: All waited patiently outside the palace, eager to step into the throne room.
Media:vo yywq001 4 narrator 03.ogg Narrator: The forger of great legacies, the world famous fighter, Attendant A.
Media:vo yywq001 4 narrator 04.ogg Narrator: His glory is resplendent, and his travels the epics of the day.
Media:vo yywq001 4 narrator 05.ogg Narrator: Within the realm, only the most ignorant have not heard of the hero, or given him acclaim.
Media:vo yywq001 5 equerryb 01.ogg Servant B: A phenomenal plan takes time to formulate. Use your brain, not your fists.
Media:vo yywq001 5 equerryb 02.ogg Servant B: You think I'm afraid? D—Don't discount my field expertise!
Media:vo yywq001 5 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: The often indecisive and over-cautious tactician, Attendant B.
Media:vo yywq001 5 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: Specialist in surviving any and everything in one piece.
Media:vo yywq001 5 narrator 03.ogg Narrator: Is he paranoid, or simply meticulous? No consensus exists.
Media:vo yywq001 6 equerryc 01.ogg Servant C: "See, this cloak has a very colorful history. Please listen very carefully..."
Media:vo yywq001 6 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: And finally, our preeminent dragon-slayer, Attendant C.
Media:vo yywq001 6 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: "Dragonslaying is a piece of cake, if you must ask me."
Media:vo yywq001 6 narrator 03.ogg Narrator: The slayer recounted his many legends, showcasing spoils for all to see.
Media:vo yywq001 7 equerrya 01.ogg Servant A: I swear upon all my past glory, a triumph for our princess is at hand!
Media:vo yywq001 7 equerrya 02.ogg Servant A: The princess need not fear with me by her side. The dragon will fall in no time.
Media:vo yywq001 7 equerryb 01.ogg Servant B: ...A—A dragon poses no threat!
Media:vo yywq001 7 equerryb 02.ogg Servant B: My plan will make it flee with its tail between its legs.
Media:vo yywq001 7 equerryc 01.ogg Servant C: Friends, you make fair points, but you may not even have to fight.
Media:vo yywq001 7 equerryc 02.ogg Servant C: My slaying prowess is acclaimed throughout our land. The dragon will tremble and scram.
Media:vo yywq001 7 king 01.ogg King: Welcome, brave warriors! May you persevere, and prevail against the obstacles ahead.
Media:vo yywq001 7 loyalequerry 01.ogg Loyal Servant: To project shock and awe, people often exaggerate their deeds.
Media:vo yywq001 7 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: The warriors have arrived, they are ready to fight.
Media:vo yywq001 7 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: So, accompanied by her loyal servant...
Media:vo yywq001 7 narrator 03.ogg Narrator: As well as the three famed warriors, the princess set out on her quest.
Media:vo yywq001 7 princess 01.ogg Princess: Their names are so long and complicated. Why is that?
Media:vo yywq001 7 princess 02.ogg Princess: Oh! I must be ignorant. I've never heard of such a trend.
Media:vo yywq002 1 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: Outside of the city gates, there lies a blessed stretch of prairie by the lake, with lush vegetation and a gentle, pleasant breeze.
Media:vo yywq002 1 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: Seeking some time to rest, the wicked dragon landed with ease.
Media:vo yywq002 2 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: A lake across and so far away, the castle as if a bird in a cage. Have the humans finished preparing my meal, or do they yet believe they can defy their fate?
Media:vo yywq002 2 dragon 02.ogg Wicked Dragon: The sun is high, and the land scorching. In the interest of comfort, I will seek a more accommodating base.
Media:vo yywq002 2 dragon 03.ogg Wicked Dragon: For one promised moment of unrivaled taste, I have traveled for hundreds of miles, and hungered over dozens of days.
Media:vo yywq002 2 dragon 04.ogg Wicked Dragon: The humans better not exhaust my patience, for even I have never had unlimited grace.
Media:vo yywq002 2 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: Having spoken thus, the dragon sought relief in the shade, yet forthwith, from the other direction a merchant came...
Media:vo yywq002 3 merchant 01.ogg Merchant: What rotten luck, to get scammed before even concluding a single sale!
Media:vo yywq002 3 merchant 02.ogg Merchant: I am a merchant who has traveled a very long way. Is this how this kingdom deals with trades?
Media:vo yywq002 3 merchant 03.ogg Merchant: Throughout my entire career, I've never encountered a customer as loud or strange as this man today.
Media:vo yywq002 3 merchant 04.ogg Merchant: To him, everything I have for sale is either a manipulative scheme for money, or undeserving trifles of heinous quality.
Media:vo yywq002 3 merchant 05.ogg Merchant: To think I even mistook him for some kind of connoisseur, when at the end of it all, he only made a fool of me!
Media:vo yywq002 3 merchant 06.ogg Merchant: He never cared to close a sale, he just saw me as a "challenge" and refused to be "defeated"!
Media:vo yywq002 3 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: As the merchant stewed over his anger, yet another irritated soul came onto the scene.
Media:vo yywq002 4 adventurer 01.ogg Adventurer: Darn it! Why is this guy getting in my way? My quest is to track the dragon, I don't have time to waste!
Media:vo yywq002 4 adventurer 02.ogg Adventurer: As an adventurer, defeating evil is my calling! Just the thought of him makes me enraged!
Media:vo yywq002 4 adventurer 03.ogg Adventurer: All I said was that I've never heard of him, and he's treating that like the biggest mistake.
Media:vo yywq002 4 adventurer 04.ogg Adventurer: Insulting me, claiming I want to steal his glory, and suggesting my quest is just a ploy...
Media:vo yywq002 4 adventurer 05.ogg Adventurer: That must be him!
Media:vo yywq002 4 equerrya 01.ogg Servant A: Evil dragon! Show yourself! Resistance is futile!
Media:vo yywq002 4 merchant 01.ogg Merchant: That's him!
Media:vo yywq002 5 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: Humans are truly a rude and rowdy lot. To think they can cause such a ruckus without even showing their faces...
Media:vo yywq002 5 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: The man in pursuit is the kingdom's famed fighter. Though the sun continues to blaze, he continues spiritedly with his chase.
Media:vo yywq002 6 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: As an enlightened dragon, one cannot tolerate such deranged words.
Media:vo yywq002 6 dragon 02.ogg Wicked Dragon: The puny human talks big and employs an aggressive tone. Yet, does the substance of his dream back up his claim?
Media:vo yywq002 6 dragon 03.ogg Wicked Dragon: Oh... hmm.
Media:vo yywq002 6 equerrya 01.ogg Servant A: Hahahaha! It would seem that my boundless fame has caused even the evil dragon to lose its nerve.
Media:vo yywq002 6 equerrya 02.ogg Servant A: Ah! Evil dragon! I didn't believe you would actually come out and face me.
Media:vo yywq002 6 equerrya 03.ogg Servant A: Oh! And the beast is silent! Is my dream so grand that even a dragon finds it difficult to consume?
Media:vo yywq002 6 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: As the noble warrior faced off against the evil dragon, the anxious princess and her entourage arrived at last.
Media:vo yywq002 6 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: The nameless servant kept his eyes on the field. The warrior's words have ignited a fire within his heart.
Media:vo yywq002 7 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: I care not for those who are lesser. Your dream is massive, yet hollow in nature. For now, this wi— enlightened dragon still cannot decide if it's fit to eat...
Media:vo yywq002 7 equerrya 01.ogg Servant A: Evil dragon! Why do you not speak? Have you finally realized you should cower in fear?
Media:vo yywq002 7 equerrya 02.ogg Servant A: How vile of you to humiliate me, just because I am an enemy!
Media:vo yywq002 7 equerrya 03.ogg Servant A: I regarded you as a worthy opponent, yet you use such insidious tactics!
Media:vo yywq002 7 equerrya 04.ogg Servant A: I, the world-famous fighter, will never fall before your degradation and trickery. You disgust me!
Media:vo yywq002 7 loyalequerry 01.ogg Loyal Servant: I admire his fearless figure. It would be a dream to also one day prove my character.
Media:vo yywq002 7 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: The fighter's animated speech kindled a burning flame within even the oft-dispassionate heart of the royal lady.
Media:vo yywq002 8 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: Though one sees little reason to teach a lesson, perhaps no choice is left in the matter.
Media:vo yywq002 8 dragon 02.ogg Wicked Dragon: Too many appetizers before the dish ruins the mood, but just for today, I can entertain an early platter.
Media:vo yywq002 8 dragon 03.ogg Wicked Dragon: It is just as I thought. Thin and crunchy, though empty under its shell. A most marvelous texture.
Media:vo yywq002 8 loyalequerry 01.ogg Loyal Servant: Conceit became his downfall. His power did not match his stature.
Media:vo yywq002 8 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: To everyone's shock, the evil dragon then swallowed the fighter's dream in one big gulp.
Media:vo yywq002 8 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: The dragon remained unsatiated. Under everyone's gaze, it flew away to parts unfamiliar.
Media:vo yywq002 8 princess 01.ogg Princess: I am long tired of my peaceful boudoir, I wish to fight alongside my soldiers!
Media:vo yywq002 8 princess 02.ogg Princess: The warrior was handily defeated! So he was a gifted orator, but never a true fighter.
Media:vo yywq002 9 passerby 01.ogg Bystander: Hey! It's been all talk and no fighting. Give us a fight!
Media:vo yywq002 9 passerby 02.ogg Bystander: Huh? Why am I on stage? Why is everyone staring at me? Ahhh!
Media:vo yywq003 1 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: Where are the guards? Are they too terrified to face their fate?
Media:vo yywq003 1 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: The dragon flew off, and briefly rested at the gate.
Media:vo yywq003 1 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: As the evil dragon made no attempts to move or hide, the princess and her entourage quickly arrived.
Media:vo yywq003 1 narrator 03.ogg Narrator: The princess's loyal knight was the first to spot the creature, for he always rode far ahead.
Media:vo yywq003 2 loyalequerry 01.ogg Loyal Servant: How dare the dragon be insolent as such! I pledged before the king, to not let the princess come to harm.
Media:vo yywq003 2 loyalequerry 02.ogg Loyal Servant: Mayhap our tactician can succeed with his wits and charm.
Media:vo yywq003 2 loyalequerry 03.ogg Loyal Servant: Legends have it that he's the ultimate survivor.
Media:vo yywq003 2 loyalequerry 04.ogg Loyal Servant: If he can ward against dangers with fastidious care, we need not recklessly suffer.
Media:vo yywq003 2 loyalequerry 05.ogg Loyal Servant: Without a plan, we should not pull the trigger.
Media:vo yywq003 2 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: The loyal servant passed the message in a voice barely higher than a whisper.
Media:vo yywq003 2 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: "While the evil dragon rests, we will draw up a plan."
Media:vo yywq003 2 narrator 03.ogg Narrator: Upon those words she approached carefully, so the dragon would ignore her steps.
Media:vo yywq003 3 loyalequerry 01.ogg Loyal Servant: Your highness honors me, I was simply doing my duty.
Media:vo yywq003 3 loyalequerry 02.ogg Loyal Servant: He promised to quell all draconic cataclysms. Perhaps he is torn between myriad schemes.
Media:vo yywq003 3 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: Through all faith and cynicism, the cautious tactician remained silent, his face one of dismay and gloom.
Media:vo yywq003 3 princess 01.ogg Princess: The tactician is correct. We require a plan before we fight.
Media:vo yywq003 3 princess 02.ogg Princess: Thanks to my servant's far-sighted work, we have seized the initiative.
Media:vo yywq003 3 princess 03.ogg Princess: Placing the saddle on the right horse is the way of the world. Take your praise with pride.
Media:vo yywq003 3 princess 04.ogg Princess: The tactician has fallen behind. Why does he falter? Did he get entangled in a struggle?
Media:vo yywq003 4 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: Haha, this merciful enlightened one shall grant thee all the time in the world. Only at dusk will I call the dust to settle.
Media:vo yywq003 4 equerryb 02.ogg Servant B: S—Stratagem? No stratagem can be perfected so quickly for a situation this grave. More time is vital...
Media:vo yywq003 4 equerryb 03.ogg Servant B: Aah!
Media:vo yywq003 4 loyalequerry 01.ogg Loyal Servant: O tactician, the dragon beckons. Please enlighten us about the stratagem.
Media:vo yywq003 4 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: Attendant B shook where he stood, stopping just short from falling to his knees.
Media:vo yywq003 4 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: He muttered and apologized, then ran away to the gate without hesitation.
Media:vo yywq003 4 princess 01.ogg Princess: Hark, the evil dragon speaks! It was simply feigning sleep to lure us into peril!
Media:vo yywq003 5 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: If the king had chosen to appease me, I wouldn't have been able to enjoy such a scene!
Media:vo yywq003 5 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: The princess and her loyal servant rushed off to find him, while the dragon broke into laughter.
Media:vo yywq003 5 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: Leaving behind her tactician-seeking servant, the princess returned alone to keep the dragon under guard.
Media:vo yywq003 6 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: An old guard arrived. Though he was quite visibly drunk, his footsteps were surprisingly steady.
Media:vo yywq003 6 princess 01.ogg Princess: If a mirage belies the tactician's wisdom, what may I call on to keep my kingdom safe?
Media:vo yywq003 6 princess 02.ogg Princess: The element of surprise fades; the dragon now lies calmly in wait.
Media:vo yywq003 6 princess 03.ogg Princess: The tactician has lost his nerve, yet my servant followed in pursuit.
Media:vo yywq003 6 princess 04.ogg Princess: Shockingly, open city gates greet me where guards should have stood.
Media:vo yywq003 7 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: Though the young guard learned much from his senior, he hasn't forgotten his wish to defend the kingdom.
Media:vo yywq003 7 veteranguard 01.ogg Old Guard: *Hic* If you ask me, this time of peace is truly fantastic, what with food, wine and beauties!
Media:vo yywq003 7 veteranguard 02.ogg Old Guard: The aristocrats have never known our hardships, the searing sun and the chilling wind!
Media:vo yywq003 7 veteranguard 03.ogg Old Guard: Dragons? Tacticians? What a boatload of nonsense!
Media:vo yywq003 7 veteranguard 04.ogg Old Guard: My eyes are dim now, and my ears ring. Why did they send me out to the front lines to take on a dragon?
Media:vo yywq003 8 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: Haha, very well, very well! Let this enlightened one see if you have any battle prowess to back up that shout!
Media:vo yywq003 8 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: Huh? Did he just run off!? It must have been the food!
Media:vo yywq003 8 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: The show must go on! Should I find someone to take his place?
Media:vo yywq003 8 narrator 03.ogg Narrator: The loyal servant finally returned just as the terrible fight was about to break out.
Media:vo yywq003 8 youngguard 01.ogg Young Guard: F—For the princess, I must fight!
Media:vo yywq003 8 youngguard 02.ogg Young Guard: With everyone gone, I am the last line of defense!
Media:vo yywq003 8 youngguard 03.ogg Young Guard: I must save the kingdom from... from...
Media:vo yywq003 8 youngguard 04.ogg Young Guard: Um... my belly... could it be...?! No! Not right now!
Media:vo yywq003 8 youngguarda 01.ogg "Young Guard": Uhh, my line should be...
Media:vo yywq003 8 youngguarda 02.ogg "Young Guard": Look here, dragon!!
Media:vo yywq003 9 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: Though my appetite remains healthy, you did well to quench my cravings.
Media:vo yywq003 9 dragon 02.ogg Wicked Dragon: The portions were modest, yet the taste remained rather satisfying.
Media:vo yywq003 9 dragon 03.ogg Wicked Dragon: If the appetizers had already entertained me so, surely the main dish would cast a spell.
Media:vo yywq003 9 loyalequerry 01.ogg Loyal Servant: The tactician's trail fades, but the guard should carry his weight.
Media:vo yywq003 9 loyalequerry 02.ogg Loyal Servant: No, I should have led him into battle, I was still way too late!
Media:vo yywq003 9 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: The late arrival let out a resigned sigh even as the dragon raised the stakes.
Media:vo yywq003 9 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: Though the young guard fought with valor, the cunning dragon still snapped up the prize in one take.
Media:vo yywq003 9 narrator 03.ogg Narrator: Thus again satisfied, the proud dragon licked its mouth and leisurely flew off.
Media:vo yywq003 9 youngguarda 01.ogg "Young Guard": *sob* If I had worked harder during training, I wouldn't feel so helpless today...
Media:vo yywq004 1 loyalequerry 01.ogg Loyal Servant: If I bore his tools and freed his mind, perhaps a victory he shall find.
Media:vo yywq004 1 loyalequerry 02.ogg Loyal Servant: He bears the sword of destiny, the blade of the chosen one.
Media:vo yywq004 1 loyalequerry 03.ogg Loyal Servant: He will raise it before the dragon, and victory will follow in time.
Media:vo yywq004 1 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: Still vowing to defeat the dragon, the princess followed the trail.
Media:vo yywq004 1 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: The servant continued at his pace, shouldering all burdens without fail.
Media:vo yywq004 1 narrator 03.ogg Narrator: Though the slayer scorned the servant, the loyal man paid it no mind.
Media:vo yywq004 1 narrator 04.ogg Narrator: As if hearing his thoughts, the dragon descended upon a village.
Media:vo yywq004 2 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: Let me see, let me find. Is my golden dream right at hand?
Media:vo yywq004 2 dragon 02.ogg Wicked Dragon: The human realizes not how comical he and his words appear.
Media:vo yywq004 2 dragon 03.ogg Wicked Dragon: Haha, for a dull human, you sure have a sharp tongue.
Media:vo yywq004 2 dragon 04.ogg Wicked Dragon: Let's see it, then, if among heroes you truly belong.
Media:vo yywq004 2 equerryc 01.ogg Servant C: O dragon, no one would laugh at you if you were to flee in fear!
Media:vo yywq004 2 equerryc 02.ogg Servant C: Wise and merciful as I am, I will refrain from taking the bait.
Media:vo yywq004 2 equerryc 03.ogg Servant C: However, I pray you will live to regret what you say.
Media:vo yywq004 2 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: The princess has also finally caught up with her attendants.
Media:vo yywq004 3 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: Ah, and here I thought you were privy to some special art.
Media:vo yywq004 3 dragon 02.ogg Wicked Dragon: Did you plan to flee all along, and have only been waiting for a chance to depart? Hmm?
Media:vo yywq004 3 equerryc 01.ogg Servant C: Your Highness, your permission to charge.
Media:vo yywq004 3 equerryc 02.ogg Servant C: With my blade and extensive experience, I will take this dragon apart.
Media:vo yywq004 3 equerryc 03.ogg Servant C: I once slew a poisonous dragon, and took this most precious reward.
Media:vo yywq004 3 equerryc 04.ogg Servant C: This cloak lets me evade any type of regard.
Media:vo yywq004 3 equerryc 05.ogg Servant C: I will bide my time, and find the moment to strike the heart.
Media:vo yywq004 3 narrator 01.ogg Narrator:  If the slayer put on his cloak and walked into the crowd, who would be able to tell him apart?
Media:vo yywq004 3 princess 01.ogg Princess: It should be my duty to banish the dragon.
Media:vo yywq004 3 princess 02.ogg Princess: Permission granted. Be on your guard.
Media:vo yywq004 4 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: By all means, please go on. This enlightened one cannot wait to play your game.
Media:vo yywq004 4 equerryc 01.ogg Servant C: Dragon, how dare you slander my name?
Media:vo yywq004 4 equerryc 02.ogg Servant C: Despite my patience and mercy, you have shown no shame.
Media:vo yywq004 4 equerryc 03.ogg Servant C: Bitter regret will be yours after I take aim.
Media:vo yywq004 4 equerryc 04.ogg Servant C: L—Let's take it over there!
Media:vo yywq004 4 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: Silently acknowledging the request, the dragon twisted its features into a benevolent smile.
Media:vo yywq004 5 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: In a flash, the dragon landed at the promised place.
Media:vo yywq004 5 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: The princess and her loyal servant immediately followed apace.
Media:vo yywq004 5 narrator 03.ogg Narrator: But the slayer remained rooted in place. Has he somehow lost his faith?
Media:vo yywq004 6 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: Hahaha. What must be a shining myth to you is but trivial babble to me.
Media:vo yywq004 6 dragon 02.ogg Wicked Dragon: I will settle and not even move two feet. Attack as you please.
Media:vo yywq004 6 equerryc 01.ogg Servant C: ...Evil dragon, you'll see what I'm made of!
Media:vo yywq004 6 equerryc 02.ogg Servant C: I've climbed mountains, crossed lakes, traversed dungeons, and defeated your kin...
Media:vo yywq004 6 equerryc 03.ogg Servant C: To finally obtain this sword, the blade of fate.
Media:vo yywq004 6 equerryc 04.ogg Servant C: Leave now, otherwise this razor-sharp blade will cut you into pieces!
Media:vo yywq004 6 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: Simple villagers gathered to witness the scene. Many were fascinated by the blade's myth.
Media:vo yywq004 6 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: A farmer came forward to try out the blade, but others wondered if hands that had only held a pitchfork could even grasp the hilt.
Media:vo yywq004 7 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: Alas, I've grown tired of words and charades. When will a puny human finally save the day?
Media:vo yywq004 7 dragon 02.ogg Wicked Dragon: Take the blade and strike me down, if you mean what you say!
Media:vo yywq004 7 dragon 03.ogg Wicked Dragon: A dragon slayer? You are but a charlatan.
Media:vo yywq004 7 dragon 04.ogg Wicked Dragon: Drop your pretense and ask the child. Even he can see through you.
Media:vo yywq004 7 equerryc 01.ogg Servant C: A—A mighty dragon slayer shan't do your bidding!
Media:vo yywq004 7 farmer 01.ogg Farmer: I consider myself a fit man, a match for knights from the palace.
Media:vo yywq004 7 farmer 02.ogg Farmer: Uh! I thought I was strong enough, but I couldn't even shake it.
Media:vo yywq004 7 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: The farmer used all his strength, but the sword remained in place.
Media:vo yywq004 7 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: As for the princess and her servant, they also declined to try their faith.
Media:vo yywq004 7 narrator 03.ogg Narrator: The dragon observed intently, but its patience finally wore away.
Media:vo yywq004 7 narrator 04.ogg Narrator: Could the dragon's words be true, and there is no true dream under those layers of armor?
Media:vo yywq004 8 child 01.ogg Child: A dragon, bigger than those from the rhymes! But I won't be scared!
Media:vo yywq004 8 child 02.ogg Child: That shiny armor, why does it click? His mouth is open, why does he not speak?
Media:vo yywq004 8 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: Though I'm not hungry, this snack's been delivered straight to my door!
Media:vo yywq004 8 dragon 02.ogg Wicked Dragon: *chews* Hmph, it's just as I expected. Long rotten dreams make for terrible food.
Media:vo yywq004 8 dragon 03.ogg Wicked Dragon: This bad apple taste... what a disgrace.
Media:vo yywq004 8 loyalequerry 01.ogg Loyal Servant: The slayer was also defeated!
Media:vo yywq004 8 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: The dragon's huge mouth instantly swallowed the slayer's dream.
Media:vo yywq004 8 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: The dragon again departed the scene, leaving only the bewildered slayer in his wake.
Media:vo yywq004 8 princess 01.ogg Princess: So the tales of past battles did not hold up.
Media:vo yywq004 9 passerby 01.ogg Bystander: Huh? Is there a show on? Well, whatever. I need to get home.
Media:vo yywq004 9 passerby 02.ogg Bystander: How did I get here? Oh no, my wife's waiting for me to cook dinner!
Media:vo yywq005 1 loyalequerry 01.ogg Loyal Servant: As her most loyal servant, I should share her worries.
Media:vo yywq005 1 loyalequerry 02.ogg Loyal Servant: I am a nobody, but thanks to her, I was given a place.
Media:vo yywq005 1 loyalequerry 03.ogg Loyal Servant: Nevertheless, I admire the princess's diligence and kindness.
Media:vo yywq005 1 loyalequerry 04.ogg Loyal Servant: Please, don't dwell in sadness. We can reflect on the trio's mistakes.
Media:vo yywq005 1 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: An inflated ego, yet falling at the first hurdle... the princess remembered what she'd seen.
Media:vo yywq005 1 princess 01.ogg Princess: The sun's about to set, and the moon soon to rise.
Media:vo yywq005 1 princess 02.ogg Princess: Our time is almost up, but evil survives.
Media:vo yywq005 1 princess 03.ogg Princess: The famed attendants all took on the dragon, but they fell one by one.
Media:vo yywq005 1 princess 04.ogg Princess: I made a vow, when all of this began...
Media:vo yywq005 1 princess 05.ogg Princess: But now I fear, my vow has become a farce...
Media:vo yywq005 1 princess 06.ogg Princess: Your counsel is valid. Let me recall their words and deeds.
Media:vo yywq005 2 equerrya 01.ogg Servant A: I fancied myself a fighter, but my enemy saw right through me. I overestimated my ability.
Media:vo yywq005 2 equerrya 02.ogg Servant A: I couldn't win against a strong enemy, but I also clung hard to my conceit.
Media:vo yywq005 2 equerrya 03.ogg Servant A: I lacked respect, because I feared others wouldn't respect me.
Media:vo yywq005 2 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: A supposedly foolproof plan, yet with no one to see it through... the princess remembered again.
Media:vo yywq005 2 princess 01.ogg Princess: A dream that was massive in size, yet hollow inside.
Media:vo yywq005 2 princess 02.ogg Princess: Lots of guts, but no ability.
Media:vo yywq005 3 equerryb 01.ogg Servant B: To protect myself, I ran away and let others take my place.
Media:vo yywq005 3 equerryb 02.ogg Servant B: All my plans evaporated when I saw the dragon in front of me.
Media:vo yywq005 3 equerryb 03.ogg Servant B: I did survive everything, but every time, I did so by abandoning those standing next to me.
Media:vo yywq005 3 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: Avoiding the present, and only speaking endlessly of past glories... the princess remembered one last time.
Media:vo yywq005 3 princess 01.ogg Princess: He was a tactician with neither morals nor strategy.
Media:vo yywq005 3 princess 02.ogg Princess: It's natural to be cautious, but one who abandons their comrades is no hero.
Media:vo yywq005 4 equerryc 01.ogg Servant C: My past has proved my deeds, my laurels should now be able to speak for me.
Media:vo yywq005 4 equerryc 02.ogg Servant C: To give my life now would be foolish. It's elementary to balance risk and benefits.
Media:vo yywq005 4 loyalequerry 01.ogg Loyal Servant: Though I am but a lowly bystander in the palace...
Media:vo yywq005 4 loyalequerry 02.ogg Loyal Servant: I know you to be humble and grounded.
Media:vo yywq005 4 loyalequerry 03.ogg Loyal Servant: You are never selfish or merciless.
Media:vo yywq005 4 loyalequerry 04.ogg Loyal Servant: All know you for your eagerness and diligence, your dreams that are no less than gold.
Media:vo yywq005 4 loyalequerry 05.ogg Loyal Servant: Your Highness, please don't underestimate yourself. Believe in your golden ideals...
Media:vo yywq005 4 loyalequerry 06.ogg Loyal Servant: And that you will slay that dream-devouring dragon for good!
Media:vo yywq005 4 princess 01.ogg Princess: His past has faded, all he has now is his former glory.
Media:vo yywq005 4 princess 02.ogg Princess: The spirit has decayed. He has long forgotten the taste of his dream.
Media:vo yywq005 4 princess 03.ogg Princess: Ah, if they all failed to defeat the dragon, then I...
Media:vo yywq005 4 princess 04.ogg Princess: With only my dream and my rapier, how can I possibly defeat the dragon?
Media:vo yywq005 5 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: I've had snack after snack, but dinner still eludes me.
Media:vo yywq005 5 dragon 02.ogg Wicked Dragon: Snacks are distractions; in the end, they have no true substance.
Media:vo yywq005 5 dragon 03.ogg Wicked Dragon: What's more, some of these just made me feel sick.
Media:vo yywq005 5 dragon 04.ogg Wicked Dragon: I'm afraid only a true golden dream can sufficiently quench my cravings.
Media:vo yywq005 5 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: It is almost night. The dragon has changed its name to "the starving one."
Media:vo yywq005 5 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: The loyal servant approached quietly to observe the dragon. For the princess, he will do any and everything.
Media:vo yywq005 6 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: I shouldn't have underestimated the humans, or been so gluttonous...
Media:vo yywq005 6 dragon 02.ogg Wicked Dragon: Now that my stomach is churning, I have no strength left to face off against the king.
Media:vo yywq005 6 loyalequerry 01.ogg Loyal Servant: ...For my promise to the king...
Media:vo yywq005 6 loyalequerry 02.ogg Loyal Servant: ...But also, to make her happy. Even if it seems impossible..
Media:vo yywq005 6 loyalequerry 03.ogg Loyal Servant: Huh? The dragon looks strange, why is it covering its chest? Let's hear what it's mumbling...
Media:vo yywq005 6 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: Overjoyed, the loyal servant rushed back to share the news.
Media:vo yywq005 7 dragon 01.ogg Wicked Dragon: Ahhh! Filthy human!
Media:vo yywq005 7 loyalequerry 01.ogg Loyal Servant: Look! There's a spot above its heart that isn't covered by scales!
Media:vo yywq005 7 loyalequerry 02.ogg Loyal Servant: Take it down, while it's still weak!
Media:vo yywq005 7 narrator 01.ogg Narrator: With a fearless thrust, the princess fulfilled her pledge.
Media:vo yywq005 7 narrator 02.ogg Narrator: The Shatterer of Despair, Flügel der Dunkelheit, Servant of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung!
Media:vo yywq005 7 narrator 03.ogg Narrator: Finally, the princess personally defeated the dragon, and peace returned to the kingdom.
Media:vo yywq005 7 narrator 04.ogg Narrator: All praise, all praise.
Media:vo yywq005 7 princess 01.ogg Princess: My heart is full of courage. I will wield my rapier with pride.
Media:vo yywq005 7 princess 02.ogg Princess: Evil dragon! I challenge thee to protect my kingdom!
Media:vo yywq005 7 princess 03.ogg Princess: The world opens itself before those who do not forget their dreams and nobility.
Media:vo yywq005 7 princess 04.ogg Princess: Thank you as well, my loyal servant. You deserve a fitting reward.
Media:vo yywq005 7 princess 05.ogg Princess: In light of our recent trials, I will name you...
Message: "Huh, I didn't think that Arnold would actually take the stage. Congratulations! Well, you had very few lines, though."
Message: "Servant A's voice is so loud. Gave me a real fright, and no mistake! We could hear that voice loud and clear even sitting at the back..."
Message: "Since the wicked dragon is here, why didn't it start feasting on the spot?"
Message: "The hungry dragon was super weak. One's got to wonder if one could beat him with a single strike too, eh?"
Message: "This was a real gut-buster. Still, why is the loyal servant's title so long?"
Message: "Why can't I draw the sword in the stone?"
Narrator: But nothing happened at all.
Narrator: Phew, the scene-to-scene proceedings were honestly harder than I imagined...
Narrator: We almost had a big mess in the middle, too... But I guess it all worked out in the end, huh?
Reply: "...Ah, then would the taste of those dreams not be splendid beyond compare?"
Reply: "...And you know, to take care of one's health!"
Reply: "Congratulations, Arnold!"
Reply: "Hey there, that prop is the property of our troupe, so please do not attempt to make off with it."
Reply: "Instant gratification has no place in the aesthetics of a wicked dragon! First comes expectation, and then comes patience! Once a dragon's yearning for golden dreams has reached its peak..."
Reply: "Please take care of what you eat as well, dear audience! May you and your appetites stay healthy!"
Reply: "Thanks for your concern for our actors. Don't you worry, the troupe head has already prepared some hot water for him!"
Reply: "The important thing is to take the first step forward boldly!"
Reply: "Well, this is a recent fad within the kingdom. Perhaps you, too, might like to grant yourself a title of suitable vibrance. [sic] such as..."
Reply: "Witness to Phantasmagoria, Grandmaster Fan of the Twilight Theater!"
Theater Staff Member: The thearter has yet to open. If you have any questions, please direct them to our Troupe Head. Our Head often goes to the palace in the highest place, so if you need any help, you can go and look for him.
