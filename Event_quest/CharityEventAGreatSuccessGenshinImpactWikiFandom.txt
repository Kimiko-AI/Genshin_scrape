Eula - Dance of the Shimmering Wave
Eula is a member of the Lawrence Clan by birth.
The Lawrence Clan's oppressive rule plunged Mondstadt into one of the darkest periods of its history. Today, they have long since fallen from grace, but their present-day descendants still find themselves held in contempt for the transgressions of their forefathers.
Not content to accept her fate, Eula has chosen to face the hostility of others head-on, and to prove with her blade that the noble spirit forsaken by her predecessors is alive and well in her.
Should you meet this bold knight, be sure to cast aside your reservations and greet her courteously. She, in turn, will be sure to extend the utmost courtesy to you.
 But he seemed scared of us.
 Captain Eula, you are an inspiration to us all.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 10b 1.ogg Eula: Enough. Both of you. The festive spirit is turning you into giddy little children.
 Great work, everyone.
 He barely said two words before running away...
 I'll remember that.
 I'm sure we'll get along just fine.
 It's all thanks to our customers.
 Quest DescriptionThe charity event is coming to an end. Hope all the effort has paid off...
 Quite the glowing review, Outrider.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 ambor 05a 1.ogg Amber: Hehehe, that's not the half of it. When you've got the time, I should tell you the story of when Eula got made captain. Now that's a good one.
 Thank you for your generous contribution!
 We owe everything to them.
 You did great as well, Bernhard.
 You don't get any time off during the festival?
 You got stuck with the holiday shift, huh?

Media:vo jyeq004 1 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Of course! Do you have any idea how popular your charity stall is? Everyone's been talking about it...
Media:vo jyeq004 1 ambor 02.ogg Amber: "Favonian Goodies and Buddies, run by the Honorary Knight and their sidekick, is selling all kinds of fantastic treasures — and even giving away some wonderful others for FREE! Don't miss out!"
Media:vo jyeq004 1 ambor 03.ogg Amber: Haha, that's because we're still working.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 ambor 04.ogg Amber: Eula's such an experienced captain. She arranged everything this way so that the Reconnaissance Company can meet the intense demand during the festival, while still giving everyone a chance to take some time off. Gotta say, great organizing, Eula!
Media:vo jyeq004 1 ambor 05a 1.ogg Amber: Hehehe, that's not the half of it. When you've got the time, I should tell you the story of when Eula got made captain. Now that's a good one.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 ambor 06.ogg Amber: Ahem... Anyway, we didn't come here just to chit-chat... I'll let Eula do the honors.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 ambor 07.ogg Amber: Haha, nothing quite as glamorous as all that. Captain Eula wants some supplies to reward her team members with.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 ambor 08.ogg Amber: Mika's not afraid of you guys. That was his way of showing respect to you... although admittedly it is kind of a roundabout way of doing it.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 ambor 09.ogg Amber: He thinks all mighty people have unique personalities, and prefers to understand what makes them tick and the way they think before properly interacting with them.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 ambor 10.ogg Amber: He says it makes it easier to communicate that way.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 ambor 11.ogg Amber: Wait! Eula, did you just pay for my portion, too?
Media:vo jyeq004 1 ambor 12.ogg Amber: I was supposed to pay for mine separately... I'm not an official member of the Reconnaissance Company.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 bernhard 01.ogg Bernhard: Honorary Knight, Paimon! I have the most wonderful news—
Media:vo jyeq004 1 bernhard 02.ogg Bernhard: Thanks to your sterling efforts, the funds we've raised in this charity sale have blown our original predictions right out of the water! It's a phenomenal success!
Media:vo jyeq004 1 bernhard 03.ogg Bernhard: Ah, but you two deserve all the credit. It's your expert management that made this event what it was.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 bernhard 04.ogg Bernhard: I've handed over all the revenue to the person responsible for managing our charitable funds. And with that, the event finally comes to a close.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 bernhard 05.ogg Bernhard: As a gesture of our appreciation, we'd like to give you both a fee for all your hard work. You've more than earned it!
Media:vo jyeq004 1 bernhard 06.ogg Bernhard: After this, I feel like I could even run a shop of my own in the future! Haha, maybe we'll get the chance to work together one day!
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 01.ogg Eula: Ah. Found you.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 02.ogg Eula: Technically, Amber and I are on a "vacation schedule."
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 03.ogg Eula: There are more merchant caravans than usual traveling the route between Dornman Port and Mondstadt City during the festival. Extra traffic means extra security is required.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 04.ogg Eula: Yes. The Reconnaissance Company is tasked with patrolling this route during the festive period...
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 05.ogg Eula: As well as traveling with the caravans to ensure essential goods are delivered without incident, we have to investigate suspicious locations to eliminate any emerging threats.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 06.ogg Eula: Of course not. We take shifts.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 07.ogg Eula: While one team is on duty, another is resting, and a third team is on standby in case of emergencies.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 08.ogg Eula: These three teams rotate periodically.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 09.ogg Eula: Yes, alright, Amber. I did my job, like I always do. I really don't see what the fuss is all about...
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 10b 1.ogg Eula: Enough. Both of you. The festive spirit is turning you into giddy little children.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 11.ogg Eula: Okay. I need 40 portions of Knights' Special Northern Smoked Chicken, and 40 of Favonius-Favored Pile 'Em Up...
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 12.ogg Eula: Correct. Scouts use up an enormous amount of energy in a single day. Each meal, they eat enough to feed, hmm... 4–5 normal people.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 13.ogg Eula: Plus, a long-standing member has recently returned to our ranks after a long absence. I thought it would be fitting to celebrate the occasion.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 14.ogg Eula: Of all the things I could have bought, I thought it would be best to have the money go to you. That way, I can support a charitable cause while I'm at it.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 15.ogg Eula: Mika, the front-line land surveyor. He was a vital member of our team before the Grand Master borrowed him for the expedition.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 16.ogg Eula: He was the same way toward me and Amber at first. As we gradually got to know each other, he started acting more naturally.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 17.ogg Eula: Mm-hmm. It'll just take a little time, that's all.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 18.ogg Eula: You are a high-profile figure within the Knights of Favonius. As his commanding officer, I have a duty to make sure no misunderstandings arise between you.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 eula 19.ogg Eula: If you want to get official about it, then fine: it's officially my treat. There, now stop worrying.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Eula, Amber, you're here!
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? Wait, you came here looking for us?
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Ugh, so after all that, Paimon's back to being the sidekick? Hmm... Still, Paimon's really happy to hear that people are giving good reviews!
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Anyway, what have you two been up to these days? Did you go off on a trip or something? We haven't seen you around all festival.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Huh? You still have to work?
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Because of monsters and bandits and stuff?
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Whew, that seems like a lot of work... sounds like you'll be working non-stop around the clock right up until the end of the Weinlesefest!
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: That's such a huge order! What's the occasion?
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Wait... are the Knights of Favonius having an official feast? How come nobody told us about it...
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Paimon agrees! You made the right decision, Eula! It's what we business owners call a win-win situation!
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Also, about this "long-standing member" you mentioned... Is it that guy we met recently...?
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Mika, yeah, that's the one! Paimon never would've thought that shy little guy was such a strong knight!
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Interesting... sounds like Mika's the one with the unique personality.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Heh, it's alright, Eula, we get it. You're just looking after him.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Ooh, thanks to Eula and Amber, we made a whole day's worth of Mora in one fell swoop!
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Paimon told you so! We're good at this stuff.
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: It feels like we accomplished a lot together!
Media:vo jyeq004 1 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: If the chance ever comes up, let's do it again!

You hand Eula and Amber the meals they purchased. They thank you and leave.
