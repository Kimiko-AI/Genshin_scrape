Paimon: "Though the front half was lost, we've somehow managed to stay afloat on the remaining back half for some time now... Now that's what I call a ship, haha! Unfortunately, most of the ship's load is probably sitting at the bottom of the sea by now..."
Paimon: "...It seems like... we floated here on the southeast currents? Well, that doesn't matter. The problem that we need to solve right now is how to leave this place..."

Paimon: "...It seems like... we floated here on the southeast currents? Well, that doesn't matter. The problem that we need to solve right now is how to leave this place..."
Paimon: Looks to Paimon like they were a group of people who were stranded at sea. It says the "front half was lost"...
Paimon: Oh, so that must mean this is the "remaining back half"! Whew, what could have possibly caused their ship to break into two like that?
Paimon: Hmm, it also said that they ended up here by floating on the "southeast currents."
Paimon: If we follow the way that they came and look for the front half of the ship, maybe we'll find something.

Paimon: "We have no idea where we are, but it looks like we've left Inazuma far behind. Ha, I wish I could see the looks on the faces of those Shogunate lackeys!"
Paimon: "However, there doesn't appear to be a speck of dry land in sight. I'm afraid the boat won't hold up unless we find a place to make anchor soon... We need to think of a way soon."

Paimon: "We have no idea where we are, but it looks like we've left Inazuma far behind. Ha, I wish I could see the looks on the faces of those Shogunate lackeys!"
Paimon: "However, there doesn't appear to be a speck of dry land in sight. I'm afraid the boat won't hold up unless we find a place to make anchor soon... We need to think of a way soon."
Paimon: It seems the boat was full of people that left Inazuma, but then encountered some problems at sea... All they could do is drift with the currents.
Paimon: It seems that their boat was still intact at that time. Let's keep searching the area for more clues.
 Anything that's been in the water that long is probably ruined by now.
Paimon: Hey! Don't dampen our treasure hunting spirit! I'm sure any treasure we find will be nice and shiny.
 Let's bring the carved wood plank we just read with us, too.
 Maybe they found a way to survive the incident?
Paimon: Paimon sure hopes so... But the situation sounds like it was pretty dire...
 Or more monsters...
Paimon: No way, we're at sea now! All we have out here is water and big fish.
 Quest DescriptionYou discovered a strange wrecked ship on a nameless island. But the question is, where did this ship come from?
 Seems like quite the disaster.
Paimon: No kidding, the boat even broke in half...
 The words from each half of the ship are connected.
Paimon: "...It seems like... we floated here on the southeast currents? Well, that doesn't matter. The problem that we need to solve right now is how to leave this place..."
Paimon: "However, there doesn't appear to be a speck of dry land in sight. I'm afraid the boat won't hold up unless we find a place to make anchor soon... We need to think of a way soon."

Paimon: "We have no idea where we are, but it looks like we've left Inazuma far behind. Ha, I wish I could see the looks on the faces of those Shogunate lackeys!"
Paimon: According to the words carved on that wooden plank, this boat drifted here before being broken up.
Paimon: After it was broken up, half of it drifted off to the "southeast."
Paimon: Ahhh! Bring it down, bring it down, quick!
Paimon: Alright, let's snap off that plank and go search for the other half of the ship!
Paimon: Anyway, let's get moving. We've got a lot of sea to cover!
Paimon: Argh, what is this? Why are there such things in the ocean!?
Paimon: Aw, there's nothing here...
Paimon: But what would half a ship be doing in a place like this? Oh, look! There are some words carved on it. Let's see what they say...
Paimon: Hah! Look, there's something... after... all...
(A Defense Mechanism rises from the water)
Paimon: Hey! Don't dampen our treasure hunting spirit! I'm sure any treasure we find will be nice and shiny.
Paimon: Hey, this must be the other half of the ship. Let's see... Oh, there's some more words carved here!
Paimon: Hmm, but the real question is... what were they carrying on the ship?
Paimon: Hmm, it also said that they ended up here by floating on the "southeast currents."
Paimon: If we follow the way that they came and look for the front half of the ship, maybe we'll find something.
Paimon: If we place them together, it reads...
Paimon: Is that the thing that those people carried with them on the boat? How strange...
Paimon: It seems that their boat was still intact at that time. Let's keep searching the area for more clues.
Paimon: It seems the boat was full of people that left Inazuma, but then encountered some problems at sea... All they could do is drift with the currents.
Paimon: Let's get back to the shore. Who knows what else we'll meet if we stay here...
Paimon: Let's go look somewhere else.
Paimon: Let's see if we really do find something...
Paimon: Looks to Paimon like they were a group of people who were stranded at sea. It says the "front half was lost"...
Paimon: Makes sense to Paimon! Most of the ship's wood has already started to rot, the carved plank will probably break right off.
Paimon: No kidding, the boat even broke in half...
Paimon: No way, we're at sea now! All we have out here is water and big fish.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it. You think these carved words might be some sort of clue.
Paimon: Oh, so that must mean this is the "remaining back half"! Whew, what could have possibly caused their ship to break into two like that?
Paimon: Oh, this seems to be a ship... Uh, well, more like half a ship...
Paimon: Paimon gets it now. These people were transporting something on the boat when they encountered some trouble at sea and ended up drifting here.
Paimon: Paimon sure hopes so... But the situation sounds like it was pretty dire...
Paimon: Well, might as well try our luck in the area between the two broken bits of the ship.
Paimon: Well... we seem to have defeated it either way.
Paimon: Whole loada nothing here too...
Paimon: Why don't we look around some more? *gasp* Maybe we'll find treasure!
Paimon: Wâ€”Well, there's gotta be something around here...
