 All... of them?
 As a, uh...
 Don't we need to cast it or anything?
 Is there any other work that needs to be done?
 Quest DescriptionFélix Yogue, someone from the Court of Fontaine, still seems to have things he wants to say...
 Yes, go on...
Félix Yogue: Ah, bravo! All six Evermotion Mechanical Painting parts, now returned to us! Now then, all we need to do is to splice them together again...
Félix Yogue: Ah, how ridiculous and foolish those reporters were! How much ado they made about so little! After all, who are you, if not a sharp, smart, humble... and well, straight-shooting knight-errant?
Félix Yogue: Ah, right. Please take this particular device. You can take it out for a little leisure, should you, well, be at leisure.
Félix Yogue: As for me, I've got to start raising the Mora I'll need to travel to Liyue...
Félix Yogue: Come, come, all we need to do now is to join them up!
Félix Yogue: Eh, never mind. I've never been the best at analogies. I swear Xavier stole all the talent in rhetoric for himself.
Félix Yogue: Either way, give it a go. It'll be interesting, I guarantee it.

Félix Yogue: No, no, not at all. My machine is not some hastily cobbled-together amalgam of scrap!
Félix Yogue: Perfect! Why, it's lovely! Skilled in both mind and hand, you are, and more so than I could have expected, too!
Félix Yogue: Together, they will form a gigantic and beauteous Evermotion Mechanical Painting.
Félix Yogue: When I get the time, they shall hear from me. Oh yes, they will!
Félix Yogue: Why, of course! All these six smaller parts can be reunited as one!
