Narrator: One stormy night
Narrator: A girl found a way to the future in the library
Narrator: She said to herself:
Fischl: I shall create my dream kingdom
Fischl: I'll carve mountains and oceans, and erect castles and towns
Narrator: Then she spoke to those who shared her dream:
Fischl: Please be proud of all that is unreal
Fischl: For we are greater than this world!
Fischl: For our magnificent kingdom is a small and forbidden paradise

The courage to leap when faced with the precipice of a cliff is the key to freedom's gate.
 ...She hung up.
 I don't think I've ever heard it before?
 I'm just happy to see you back to your normal self.
 I'm not mocking you.
 I'm sorry, who are you?
 Me neither.
 Okay.
 Okay. Let's keep this between us for now.
 Pffft...
 Quest DescriptionThere is another Fischl here — born from the darkness, she dominates everything in Immernachtreich. Can fear and cowardice devour souls? Which one of the two Prinzessinnen shall triumph in the end?
 Whose voice is that?
 I don't think I've ever heard it before?
(Traveler): (I'm not sure what answer she's looking for from me, but I will wait until I've seen everything.)
(Traveler): (There was no trace of malice in her words. It seemed like she was reaching out for something.)
Dodocommunication Device: Dodoco!
Dodocommunication Device: Dodoco! Dodoco!
Fischl: For our magnificent kingdom is a small and forbidden paradise
Fischl: For we are greater than this world!
Fischl: I shall create my dream kingdom
Fischl: I'll carve mountains and oceans, and erect castles and towns
Fischl: Please be proud of all that is unreal
Media:vo yqeq110 1 fischl 01.ogg ???: Who are these "nobodies" you speak of?
Media:vo yqeq110 1 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: Hmph. How dare you treat one's handpicked retainers with such disdain? Begone!
Media:vo yqeq110 1 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: Don't you "but" me!
Media:vo yqeq110 1 fischl 04.ogg Fischl: Hmph, you may consider that the case for the time being.
Media:vo yqeq110 1 fischl 05.ogg Fischl: ...Nonsense. Despite the existing threats, the unrivaled glory of the Immernachtreich would not exist in this world if I, the Prinzessin, were the sort of person who could be easily swayed.
Media:vo yqeq110 1 fischl 06.ogg Fischl: ...Um... this matter can be revisited later. For now, let us proceed with more important work.
Media:vo yqeq110 1 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Troubles? Have you run into anything dangerous?
Media:vo yqeq110 1 mona 01.ogg Mona: Oh really? Are you prepared to take responsibility for what you just said?
Media:vo yqeq110 1 oz 01.ogg Oz: I must say, guards, it's immensely disrespectful of you to make such remarks to the retainers of the Immernachtreich.
Media:vo yqeq110 1 oz 02.ogg Oz: What mein Fräulein means is that it took us a long time to reach this place. She couldn't bear to leave you all here, even though she did not wish to confront this mirage.
Media:vo yqeq110 1 oz 03.ogg Oz: What mein Fräulein means to say is that there are other troubles in this area.
Media:vo yqeq110 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What's your problem? We're the Prinzessin's personal retainers.
Media:vo yqeq110 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Fischl, Oz, you're back in the crew!
Media:vo yqeq110 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: It felt like we were peeking into your diary.
Media:vo yqeq110 1 ravenguarda 01.ogg Solemn Raven: Stop! Ugh, it's you guys again!
Media:vo yqeq110 1 ravenguarda 02.ogg Solemn Raven: Her Highness and Sir Oz!?
Media:vo yqeq110 1 ravenguarda 03.ogg Solemn Raven: But...
Media:vo yqeq110 1 ravenguardb 01.ogg Severe Raven: Cut the lies! Her Highness doesn't keep company with nobodies like you.
Media:vo yqeq110 1 ravenguardb 02.ogg Severe Raven: I'll say it again. Her Highness doesn't keep company with—
Media:vo yqeq110 1 ravenguardb 03.ogg Severe Raven: Y—Yes, Your Highness!
Media:vo yqeq110 1 xinyan 01.ogg Xinyan: Didn't wanna confront it, huh? Sounds like Mona was right.
Media:vo yqeq110 1 xinyan 02.ogg Xinyan: Let's get this show on the road! The book's right in front of us, let's not just stand here.
Media:vo yqeq110 2 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Hmph... majestic but fragile, vast yet vulnerable... this domain both amazes and sickens me!
Media:vo yqeq110 2 oz 01.ogg Oz: She means that she has never seen such an extravagant mirage before, and even she is enthralled by it.
Media:vo yqeq110 3 aside 01.ogg Narrator: "...spoke amid a downpour of the dragon's blood. She said, 'May my people be freed from the shackles of ancient decrees.'"
Media:vo yqeq110 3 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Hmph, yet this kingdom appears to be anything but what I've described. The shadows lurking behind the scenes are disconcerting...
Media:vo yqeq110 3 oz 01.ogg Oz: Such wise and compassionate words could only come from your own writing, mein Fräulein.
Media:vo yqeq110 4 aside 01.ogg Narrator: "Prinzessin Fischl again continued her song, and the interwoven chords of her sacred words became the Immernachtreich's hymn."
Media:vo yqeq110 4 aside 02.ogg Narrator: "She picked up mere stones to carve out mountains and oceans, before bestowing upon her people castles and towns."
Media:vo yqeq110 4 aside 03.ogg Narrator: "My magnificent kingdom is a small and forbidden paradise."
Media:vo yqeq110 4 aside 04.ogg Narrator: "When the people worshiped her, she replied, 'Celebrate me by staging a play in the wilderness.'"
Media:vo yqeq110 4 aside 05.ogg Narrator: "'Bow down to me, and bring me beautiful dreams in return for everlasting glory within the eternal darkness.'"
Media:vo yqeq110 4 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Hmm... allow me a moment to reminisce.
Media:vo yqeq110 4 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: Oz! Don't say it out loud!
Media:vo yqeq110 4 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: I suddenly recollect that two pieces are currently missing from my royal domain.
Media:vo yqeq110 4 leon 01.ogg Leon: Aah! Help me!
Media:vo yqeq110 4 leon 02.ogg Leon: Please don't say that. I can assure you that this will definitely be the last time!
Media:vo yqeq110 4 oz 01.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein, you may recall that this is the toy castle you accidentally destroyed in a moment of deep distress.
Media:vo yqeq110 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: There's a castle here, but some parts seem to be missing. Fischl, is this yours?
Media:vo yqeq110 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So we have to find two missing pieces...
Media:vo yqeq110 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: That sounds like a happy ending to Paimon!
Media:vo yqeq110 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Paimon had a feeling he'd show up... again!
Media:vo yqeq110 5 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: ...
Media:vo yqeq110 5 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: My citizen, thy will is strong enough to sunder the wicked dragon's wings. I shall now receive thy blessing.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: Thou hast done well. 'Tis also most evident that thou dost possess the virtues of a knight. Go, take thy position, and wait for the performance to begin.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 fischl 04.ogg Fischl: Is there not a single one of my lords and ladies who understood my precepts? Fools.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: A successful journey requires perseverance, courage, as well as a keen sense of danger. You have the first two, but in the future, please strive to be more vigilant.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I suppose this is the important business Her Highness warned us about earlier.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 leon 01.ogg Leon: I shall remember your words for the rest of my life. But it is time to say our final goodbye.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 leon 02.ogg Leon: You may not have noticed, but the weather has improved, and the sea has become pleasant and calm... We have awaited this day for a long time.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 leon 03.ogg Leon: You may be amazed that someone as reckless as me could become an actor, but please believe me when I say it's not by chance.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 leon 04.ogg Leon: Every Nachtraben is looking for a way to contribute to the world. We just want to find our place, our destiny. We were born to seek the roles that fate has assigned us to play.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 leon 05.ogg Leon: You may not be aware that "Hymn of the Holy Land" is also a book of prophecies.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 leon 07.ogg Leon: Yes, it is. Hundreds of years ago, the Immernachtreich was engulfed by a menacing shadow, but our ruler stood by and did nothing, as if she had lost interest in ruling the kingdom.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 leon 08.ogg Leon: Soon after, Oz, the Great Sekretär, appeared among us. He brought us the sacred scriptures, and a most encouraging prophecy.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 leon 09.ogg Leon: That prophecy is just as it's described in the book, and predicts a blessed future for the Immernachtreich. As a result, we became convinced that the gloomy skies would eventually clear, and we have been eagerly waiting for that blessed day.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 leon 10.ogg Leon: The Soteria... the Prinzessin der Verurteilung. She will eventually remember the paradise of the Immernachtreich, and on that day, we will devote to her the plays that were promised in the prophecy.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 leon 11.ogg Leon: That is why I have stepped forward to take on the role of a warrior. I'd do whatever it takes to prove my devotion to her.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 leon 12.ogg Leon: Y—Your Highness?!
Media:vo yqeq110 5 leon 13.ogg Leon: It is my utmost honor!
Media:vo yqeq110 5 leon 14.ogg Leon: ...Thank you, Your Highness, and thank you, everyone. In that case, I will take my leave!
Media:vo yqeq110 5 leon 15.ogg Leon: Oh, by the way, please keep in mind that the password for the gate ahead is "Sieh an, mein Sommernachtgarten!"
Media:vo yqeq110 5 mona 01.ogg Mona: Yeah, you didn't need to translate that!
Media:vo yqeq110 5 oz 01.ogg Oz: We commend your unfaltering loyalty to Her Highness. Her Highness will now lead her retainers into battle against the shadow that plagues the Immernachtreich.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 oz 02.ogg Oz: What mein Fräulein means to say is that you are all rather stupid.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Prophecy? But Paimon thought it was a sacred scripture?
Media:vo yqeq110 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, right, yeah she was lurking in the back when we rescued you for some reason...
Media:vo yqeq110 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Paimon's confused. What were you guys role-playing just now?
Media:vo yqeq110 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? Wait! What is it? What's happening?
Media:vo yqeq110 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: "Sieh an, mein Sommernachtgarten!"
Media:vo yqeq110 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: There's the book! Let's go and close it.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Let's hope we won't get transported to another strange place this time...
Media:vo yqeq110 5 xinyan 01.ogg Xinyan: Fella, if you want to survive and thrive, you should be more careful next time.
Media:vo yqeq110 5 xinyan 02.ogg Xinyan: Let's get this over with!
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 01.ogg Immernacht Fischl: Hmph, how laughable. What gives you the impression that you can defeat me? You should know, over the past few days... I've seen all of your fear and trepidation.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 02.ogg Immernacht Fischl: Shadow? Yes... I suppose that probably describes our connection aptly enough. So, have you come to surrender to me, little Amy?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 03.ogg Immernacht Fischl: And that raven over there... You must be Oz? Excellent. I have been waiting for you for a long time.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 04.ogg Immernacht Fischl: I heard that a great sekretär named Oz brought the "Hymn of the Holy Land" into Immernachtreich. I suppose that was you.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 05.ogg Immernacht Fischl: I might as well inform you that the Immernachtreich is a place with no way out. Now that you've made it here, I shall crush you and make you my servant.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 06.ogg Immernacht Fischl: As for Oz, despite bringing over that hideous Book of Prophecies, and causing the foolish citizens to fall to their knees worshiping that piece of nonsense...
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 07.ogg Immernacht Fischl: Why don't you come over to my side? After all, "Fischl is destined to team up with Oz."
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 08.ogg Immernacht Fischl: You are gravely mistaken if you presume the Immernachtreich to be some kind of amusement park.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 09.ogg Immernacht Fischl: Listen closely... it is a tomb for those who cannot face reality. You will be buried here, and I will take Oz, the product of our imagination, and live forever in the royal castle.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 10.ogg Immernacht Fischl: You of all people should know about this. Why does it always rain in the Immernachtreich? Why isn't there any music in this so-called paradise?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 11.ogg Immernacht Fischl: How pathetic! No, dearest Amy, you, not I, are the one responsible for all of this!
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 12.ogg Immernacht Fischl: You dreamed up a vast kingdom, but you can't bear its weight. Swayed by fear, you can't face the very world you've created. You may try to avoid it, but the fact is: You can't change yourself.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 13.ogg Immernacht Fischl: I came here in your stead precisely because you failed to show up. The Immernachtreich is now mine, and it is not your place to tell me what to do!
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 14.ogg Immernacht Fischl: Amy, you are but a weak fool who does not deserve this world. Begone.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 15.ogg Immernacht Fischl: ...Oh, so you've made some friends. But do you really think that's enough for you to defeat me?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 darkfischl 16.ogg Immernacht Fischl: I am your fear, your dark side. I am the nightmare from which you have never escaped in all these years. Standing before me, you are nothing.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: ...
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: You must be the arch-nemesis I've been looking for, the useless and cowardly so-called Prinzessin?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: Ugh... you...
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 04.ogg Fischl: Oz!? Where do you think you are going!?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 05.ogg Fischl: Gah! This is not the time to discuss my shortcomings!
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 06.ogg Fischl: Have you been bewitched, Oz? Why should you trust that she's telling the truth? Is not the Immernachtreich a sacred land of liberty and theater?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 07.ogg Fischl: ...A tomb...?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 08.ogg Fischl: ...Because of you! It's all because of you!
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 09.ogg Fischl: Ugh...!
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 10.ogg Fischl: I... I...
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 11.ogg Fischl: Mona... *sobs*
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 12.ogg Fischl: I... I...
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 13.ogg Fischl: ...I hate to admit it, but... she might be right...
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 14.ogg Fischl: Kazuha...
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 15.ogg Fischl: Xinyan...
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 16.ogg Fischl: ...
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 17.ogg Fischl: ...
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 18.ogg Fischl: ...No. I can't... I... I can't lose. Not now.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 fischl 19.ogg Fischl: I will be the one to claim victory! Just you wait, I will make you regret everything you said!
Media:vo yqeq110 6 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Seems logical enough.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: No, Please do not think that. Your Highness, do you still remember why we came here?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I am a samurai from Inazuma who's been entrusted with your safety. These individuals also responded to your call.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Take it one step at a time and don't rush. You can win as long as you maintain a level head.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 mona 01.ogg Mona: Library? Why are we inside a library?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 mona 02.ogg Mona: He's actually going over to the other side... Fischl, haven't you taught your raven anything about loyalty?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 mona 03.ogg Mona: For you to give yourself such a piece of your mind, it must have been bothering you for a long time.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 mona 04.ogg Mona: Oh? What's that look on your face?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 mona 05.ogg Mona: Hmph. You're not going to admit defeat, are you?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 mona 06.ogg Mona: Hmm? Oh, my divination attempts are working again. And the stars say... the Fischl I know will obtain a landslide victory.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 oz 01.ogg Oz: ...At your service, mein Fräulein.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 oz 02.ogg Oz: As you can see, that's also mein Fräulein over there. And if she is mein Fräulein, then does that not make her my master?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 oz 03.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein flatters me. I see no reason to refuse.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Why is there another you? Is it a shadow?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 xinyan 01.ogg Xinyan: Why did you call her mein Fräulein?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 xinyan 02.ogg Xinyan: Hey, are you done?
Media:vo yqeq110 6 xinyan 03.ogg Xinyan: Having your own tomb does sound pretty cool, but the Immernachtreich is not a tomb.
Media:vo yqeq110 6 xinyan 04.ogg Xinyan: Get it together! Don't lose to anyone, and definitely don't lose to yourself! You ain't weak, that's not true at all.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 darkfischl 01.ogg Immernacht Fischl: Impossible! How did you make it through that nightmarish library... Stand down!
Media:vo yqeq110 7 darkfischl 02.ogg Immernacht Fischl: You...!
Media:vo yqeq110 7 darkfischl 03.ogg Immernacht Fischl: Oof!
Media:vo yqeq110 7 darkfischl 04.ogg Immernacht Fischl: Wh—What?
Media:vo yqeq110 7 darkfischl 05.ogg Immernacht Fischl: She's a loser... a coward who refuses to confront her true self behind the fantasies and lies.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 darkfischl 06.ogg Immernacht Fischl: ...
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: ...Do you still think I'm going to lose?
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: You looked down on me. You thought I was a worthless coward.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: And yes, I did use to be like that, because... I am someone who can't face reality, who spends all day daydreaming, and can't cope with setbacks or criticisms.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 04.ogg Fischl: But now I understand. I understood as soon as I first laid my eyes on this mirage.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 05.ogg Fischl: Do you see that incredible world out there? So vast, so breathtaking... that is my imagination, the source of my power.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 06.ogg Fischl: You act so arrogant under that dark cloak of self-obsession. But that's not your true nature.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 07.ogg Fischl: You're no Prinzessin. You're just a narcissistic speck of dust hiding in my shadow! You are the true loser, the one who's holding me back!
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 08.ogg Fischl: You hide your fear and cowardice behind a facade of thorns and self-loathing. You are far weaker than me.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 09.ogg Fischl: Now give it back!
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 10.ogg Fischl: Return to me what is rightfully mine! The Immernachtreich, the castle, my people... and, most importantly, my companion, Oz!
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 11.ogg Fischl: You've got some nerve opening your beak, traitor!
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 12.ogg Fischl: What do you mean "my identity"?
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 13.ogg Fischl: ...Huh?
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 14.ogg Fischl: Fischl is... well... Fischl is...
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 15.ogg Fischl: Fischl... is... me?
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 16.ogg Fischl: Huh? ...That's it?
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 17.ogg Fischl: ..."May my people be freed from the shackles of ancient decrees."
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 18.ogg Fischl: ...
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 19.ogg Fischl: ...Hahaha, everyone, lend me your ears!
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 20.ogg Fischl: Hehe, citizens of the Immernachtreich! Do you hear my summons?
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 21.ogg Fischl: Oz speaks the words of truth. Today is a grand occasion, for it is the day that I seize back my heart and reclaim control of my kingdom. I hereby announce...
Media:vo yqeq110 7 fischl 22.ogg Fischl: Welcome to the Immernachtreich!
Media:vo yqeq110 7 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Indeed. These are words of wisdom.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, Your Highness!
Media:vo yqeq110 7 mona 01.ogg Mona: The shadow seems to have returned to Fischl's heart, where it belongs.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 mona 02.ogg Mona: Ugh, there she goes again, I am so done with this...
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 01.ogg Oz: Oh, mein Fräulein, you speak with such eloquence and vigor now. You've truly matured into the Prinzessin.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 02.ogg Oz: No, mein Fräulein, I've come here to prove something to you all.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 03.ogg Oz: As we all know, Oz will always follow Fischl, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung. It should make no difference whose side I am on, because you're both Fischl.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 04.ogg Oz: But consider this: When I switched sides, you did not lose your identity, did you?
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 05.ogg Oz: Whom do you suppose "Fischl" truly is?
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 06.ogg Oz: This is my question to you, mein Fräulein.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 07.ogg Oz: No, you are wrong.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 08.ogg Oz: Ah, you caught on most rapidly.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 09.ogg Oz: Indeed, mein Fräulein. Fischl is sometimes the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, and other times not. She may be courageous and arrogant, but she may also be weak and cowardly.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 10.ogg Oz: Fischl is you. Both noble and humble, she is a first-rate adventurer with few friends and the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, the Sovereign of the Immernachtreich.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 11.ogg Oz: Fischl is both timid and strong. She's afraid of others' gossip, yet yearns for their respect.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 12.ogg Oz: Most importantly, Fischl is often self-deprecating, beating herself up countless times, yet she always finds a way to rise again.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 13.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein, no one merits the name Fischl more than you do. It's a complex yet simple name that represents the beauty of dreams and liberty.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 14.ogg Oz: With or without loyal admirers, Amy will always be Fischl. You are Fischl, the enlightened one who has always carried that belief in her heart.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 15.ogg Oz: Thank you for creating the Immernachtreich and giving us a homeland, for authoring the "Hymn of the Holy Land" in your subconscious, which offered us hope for a bright future.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 oz 16.ogg Oz: Please embrace your darkness and return to your true form, Your Highness.
Media:vo yqeq110 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa! Fancy-dress Fischl vanished! Wait a minute... and now she's back?
Media:vo yqeq110 7 together 01.ogg Paimon, Xinyan, and Mona: Yaaay!
Media:vo yqeq110 7 xinyan 01.ogg Xinyan: There she is!
Media:vo yqeq110 8 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: (What a wonderful day. I reclaimed my heart and became the true Prinzessin der Verurteilung.)
Media:vo yqeq110 8 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: (The Immernachtreich really appeared. Even so, I know that all the negative emotion I've been harboring in my heart will not simply go away.)
Media:vo yqeq110 8 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: (And that's okay. I'll carry these imperfections with me as I fight on, because I now know that what I have is unique and wonderful.)
Media:vo yqeq110 8 fischl 04.ogg Fischl: Ahem! How dare you, retainer of mine, mock the great and dignified Prinzessin der Verurteilung?
Media:vo yqeq110 8 fischl 05.ogg Fischl: ...Hehe, I concur!
Media:vo yqeq110 8 fischl 06.ogg Fischl: Now let us rejoice and celebrate this historic moment for the Immernachtreich!
Media:vo yqeq110 8 fischl 07.ogg Fischl: Anyway, Oz... um... I, uh, ahem... thank you.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 fischl 08.ogg Fischl: Then I shall grant you the honor of accompanying me to the performance.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: "On the homeward road, ravens soar into the sky..."
Media:vo yqeq110 8 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Although the mirages are essentially independent, I believe there is some connection.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: The final line... but of course, "Rainbow greets my eye."
Media:vo yqeq110 8 mona 01.ogg Mona: ...Ugh...
Media:vo yqeq110 8 mona 02.ogg Mona: Watching a theater performance in a nation like this must be quite an experience.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 mona 03.ogg Mona: As for the puzzle I'm working on... I should have an answer soon.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 mona 04.ogg Mona: Fischl's dilemma was indeed within herself. But there was only one phantom, not a swarm... so my guess was a little off the mark.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 mona 05.ogg Mona: After all that she went through, it's good that she finally got to reconcile with herself.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 mona 06.ogg Mona: Still, it looks like I won't be free from this Court Archmage role anytime soon...
Media:vo yqeq110 8 nahida 01.ogg ???: Oh? It's you.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 nahida 02.ogg ???: You're right, we've never met before.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 nahida 03.ogg ???: I know you want to communicate with someone beyond the islands, but you can't do that right now. So I cut off your connection.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 nahida 04.ogg ???: Wouldn't you rather find out the answer for yourself than ask someone else? The fantastic mirage represents the "deep dream," the most fundamental reflection of the human heart.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 nahida 05.ogg ???: Go see for yourself. Witness everything with your own eyes, and when this is all over, tell me what you feel about it.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 oz 01.ogg Oz: Lady Paimon, do watch your words.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 oz 02.ogg Oz: Oh, what mein Fräulein means is that she entreats you to celebrate the arrival of the Immernachtreich with utmost zeal and great joy...
Media:vo yqeq110 8 oz 03.ogg Oz: Very well, see you soon.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 oz 04.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein, I was merely doing my duty. You need not thank me. Rather, it's my honor to follow you.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 oz 05.ogg Oz: As you wish, mein Fräulein.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Fischl, the stage is all set up outside! Wanna go check it out?
Media:vo yqeq110 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, right! Okay, Your Highness, wouldst thou care to venture outdoors and... checketh stuff out?
Media:vo yqeq110 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Alright, alright, we get it... Please don't translate her words back into Fischlspeak...
Media:vo yqeq110 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, there's something we've gotta do! Your Highness, Oz, please excuse us for a moment.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: C'mon, let's try to contact Venti again.
Media:vo yqeq110 8 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Huh? That isn't the Tone-Deaf Bard?
Media:vo yqeq110 8 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Huh!?
Media:vo yqeq110 8 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: (Traveler), who the heck was that!?
Media:vo yqeq110 8 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: This is weird. How was she able to cut off our connection to Venti... and why would she wanna know what you feel?
Media:vo yqeq110 8 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Nope! Paimon doesn't get it!
Media:vo yqeq110 8 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: It's kinda eerie, but... but Paimon will protect you! Paimon will be there for you no matter what!
Media:vo yqeq110 8 xinyan 01.ogg Xinyan: Fischl's rebuttal totally rocked! It was so dramatic and so powerful! I didn't want to interrupt her, or I would've started blasting out a backing track!
Media:vo yqeq110 8 xinyan 02.ogg Xinyan: The stage is set up and everyone's here together. Love this feeling!
Media:vo yqeq110 8 xinyan 03.ogg Xinyan: Let's celebrate this special occasion together!
