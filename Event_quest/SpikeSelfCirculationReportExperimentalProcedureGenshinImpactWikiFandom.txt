 Quest DescriptionHosseini has finally figured out how to get the Pursina's Spike into the depths of the mines...
 Shall we start now, then?
After the Pursina's Spike has been moved to the tunnel depths, Hosseini arrives at the site of the rupture.
Hosseini: *cough* According to my estimations, this should be the opening through which the Ley Lines are overflowing.
Hosseini: Ah, (Traveler)! I apologize, but I need more time to finish the adjustments to the Pursina's Spike.
Hosseini: I believe that this will solve our problem for good.
Hosseini: If we can get the Spike up and running here, we can affect the Ley Lines such that the opening can be closed...
Hosseini: No, we cannot. I must perform another round of checks. We cannot afford to have another problem like the one we faced during the test run.
Hosseini: Once the Spike is ready, we will be rid of this terrible mud and the monsters that come with it... *cough*
Hosseini: Well, the Spike has finally been placed.
