 Quest DescriptionMondstadt's Katheryne has a gift to pass on to you. It seems to have come from dancing bake-danuki...?
Katheryne: (Traveler), Paimon, have you met two bake-danuki recently, by any chance? One of them carries a purple cloth bag, while the other has a yellow one...
Katheryne: Ah, great, so you do know them.
Katheryne: From their gesticulations, I had a feeling that they might be friends of yours. I think they wanted me to give this to you.
Katheryne: Not really, they just made a bunch of gestures before giving me this...
Paimon: Hehe, looks like their journey's off to a good start! Paimon wonders if we'll ever meet again...
Paimon: Ooh! So this is a gift from Mamesuke and Shibasuke!
Paimon: Ooh! You must be talking about Mamesuke and Shibasuke!
Paimon: Um, did something happen to them?
