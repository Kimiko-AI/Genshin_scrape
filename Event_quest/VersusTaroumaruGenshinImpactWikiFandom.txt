 Did you cheese him off somehow...
 Eh? It's Taroumaru?
 I didn't get that, but bring it on anyway.
Taroumaru: Woof!
 Not that I understood that, but give me a moment to prepare.
Taroumaru: Woof, woof, woof!
 Quest DescriptionThe one who comes now is your most formidable opponent â€” and he is none other than Taroumaru, boss of Komore Teahouse!
 Taroumaru's barking is getting louder...
 The "mightiest warrior" is Taroumaru!
Paimon: But if we win... we can buy you some tasty snacks to eat.
Paimon: Huh, Yasuhiko Tarou did say earlier that the fourth warrior came because they lacked some Mora on hand. Guess Taroumaru's in it for the prize as well, huh?
Paimon: Taroumaru, this is a most solemn duel. The prize must go to the one who is more skilled in martial arts between yourself and (Traveler).
Paimon: Well, sorry, Taroumaru, but Paimon isn't gonna give an inch when it comes to Mora!
Taroumaru: Woof!
Taroumaru: Woof! Woof, woof! Woof!
Taroumaru: Woof, woof woof! Woof, woof!
Taroumaru: Woof, woof, woof!
Taroumaru: Woof?
