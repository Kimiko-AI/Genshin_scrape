 ...Why the sound effects?
 Alright, we'll wait inside until Diluc gets back.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 09b 1.ogg Paimon: Ummm... But Paimon will feel kinda bad if we're sitting in Diluc's house twiddling our thumbs while he's out there hard at work.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 09b 2.ogg Paimon: Let's go to Falcon Coast and help Diluc sort out his issues.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 09b 3.ogg Paimon: Although Diluc is super strong, surely he'd appreciate a little support.
 At most, there might be a few remnants left.
 Diluc must have already been here.
 Grape juice, actually...
 Guessing it has something to do with Diluc's part-time job.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 09a 1.ogg Paimon: Huh? You mean the Darkn—
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 09a 2.ogg Paimon: Uhhhh... the dark 'n' evil Abyss Order are up to no good again?
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 09a 3.ogg Paimon: In that case — Master Diluc's our friend, we can't sit here and do nothing!
 I bet that's the "phenomenon" he was talking about.
 It must be Diluc from when he fought here in the past.
 It still doesn't sound like the most profitable venture.
 It's too early to say for sure.
 Let's observe for now.
 Not quite "important business"...
 Or have you suddenly developed an interest in ley line anomalies?
 Quest DescriptionThe weather is starting to get hot. Paimon wants to buy some fruit juice from Dawn Winery to cool off...
 Read the first note.
The First Note: It's been years since the ley lines last released such highly aggressive monsters during an anomaly.
The First Note: The Darknight Hero's timing was perfect. The way he lured the monsters a few at a time into the open to defeat them one by one... quite the strategy.
The First Note: And then he pretended to be seriously injured, luring out the Abyss Order's main forces and then meeting them head on. A truly magnificent counterattack.
The First Note: Still, this plan involved too many uncertainties. The Darknight Hero himself even said that he can't afford to take risks like this every time.
The First Note: Getting to the root of the problem and preventing these types of ley line disorders from happening is the safest approach.
Media:vo hyeq002 25 paimon 02a.ogg Paimon: Paimon didn't follow all of that. Eh, but it seemed to be about a previous battle Diluc was in?
 Read the second note.
The Second Note: Ley lines hold many secrets. We ordinary people do not need to concern ourselves with the way they work.
The Second Note: But since the Darknight Hero will be fighting against the Abyss Order for the long term, it is in our best interests to gain a deeper understanding of them.
The Second Note: I heard that the captain of the Knights of Favonius Investigation Team is a highly accomplished academic, but unlike Lisa, he is not especially close with the Acting Grand Master.
The Second Note: We should be able to learn a few things from him without the Knights of Favonius finding out.
The Second Note: Perhaps the Darknight Hero could ask him for input on the technical issues regarding the ley lines. I will deliver the letter to his camp on the mountain.
Media:vo hyeq002 25 paimon 02b.ogg Paimon: Huh? Sounds like it was talking about Albedo. Did Diluc write a letter to Albedo?
 So young Diluc's piqued your interest?
 The ley lines are showing the scene they recorded at that time.
 We need to keep monitoring the situation for a while.
 We shouldn't act rashly.
 What "issues"?
 Wouldn't that harm the Winery's business...?
 You've got a strong sense of responsibility.
Media:vo dialog hyeq001 adelinde 01.ogg Adelinde: Please send Master Diluc my regards when you find him.
Media:vo dialog hyeq001 adelinde 02.ogg Adelinde: Also, do be careful out there.
Media:vo dialog hyeq001 adelinde 03.ogg Adelinde: As Master always says, "Even when the odds of success are nine to one, you must never lower your guard."
Media:vo dialog hyeq001 adelinde 04.ogg Adelinde: Ah, you're back.
Media:vo dialog hyeq001 adelinde 05.ogg Adelinde: How are things at Falcon Coast?
Media:vo dialog hyeq001 adelinde 06.ogg Adelinde: Fair enough. Well, I don't know the first thing about combat situations anyway, so you can spare yourselves the ordeal of trying to explain it all to me.
Media:vo dialog hyeq001 adelinde 07.ogg Adelinde: If there's anything you need, let me know, and I'll sort it out.
Media:vo dialog hyeq001 adelinde 08.ogg Adelinde: I'll be right here when you need me.
Media:vo dialog hyeq001 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm, it's kinda hard to explain.
Media:vo hyeq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What a hot day. It sure feels like summer now!
Media:vo hyeq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: A glass of ice-cold fruit juice would be the perfect thing to cool down with... just saying...
Media:vo hyeq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Speaking of which, we seem to keep missing out on the discount grape juice at Dawn Winery.
Media:vo hyeq001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Paimon has a hunch that today will be the day... If we leave right now, maybe we'll get there in time!
Media:vo hyeq001 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Shall we get going, (Traveler)?
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 01.ogg Adelinde: Good day to you both. It's been quite a long time. You're looking well, as ever.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 02.ogg Adelinde: To what do we owe the honor today? Important business to discuss with Master Diluc, I presume?
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 03.ogg Adelinde: Of course I can, and no deposit necessary!
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 04.ogg Adelinde: But I'm afraid you may be in for quite a wait. Dawn Winery's discount grape juice takes a long time to make.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 05.ogg Adelinde: Every summer, Master Diluc hand-picks two barrels of the finest grapes to turn into juice.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 06.ogg Adelinde: Master has never explained his reasoning. If I had to guess...
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 07.ogg Adelinde: The discount could be a marketing technique. Special deals always attract customers.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 08.ogg Adelinde: Perhaps Master hopes to increase the popularity of fruit juice, so that people have more options when it comes to drinking.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 09.ogg Adelinde: It makes an ideal alternative for the heaviest drinkers, because they won't get drunk and start causing mischief. At the same time, those who don't drink alcohol get the chance to try something new.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 10.ogg Adelinde: Master Diluc isn't all about money. I think he would prefer to see people drinking in moderation than chase bigger profits at any cost.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 11.ogg Adelinde: Imagine if everyone could just enjoy a nice glass of wine and have a good time while keeping their wits about them and not creating trouble for others... Now wouldn't that be a miracle?
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 12.ogg Adelinde: Not just yet. He has a few more issues to sort out first. He'll start the process as soon as those are out of the way.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 13.ogg Adelinde: If you're interested, I'm sure Master Diluc would be delighted to see you and hear your thoughts.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 14.ogg Adelinde: As you know, whenever Master Diluc catches wind of any unsavory guests showing up in Mondstadt, he takes it upon himself to go and, ahem, "greet" them in person. It's the same story today.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 15.ogg Adelinde: He should be somewhere near Falcon Coast. I'm not sure how long he'll be... In the meantime, would you like to take a seat inside?
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 16.ogg Adelinde: I have to stay here and wait for some other guests, but Hillie and Moco will be glad to take care of you.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 17.ogg Adelinde: If you're happy to help, that would be wonderful. Master trusts you, after all, and you're both very capable.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 adelinde 18.ogg Adelinde: I know he'd appreciate a helping hand.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hi, Adelinde!
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: That's right. Adelinde, since we've run into you, maybe we could just get you to help us with this one?
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We always miss the Winery's discount grape juice, so this time we decided to come here early...
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Can you reserve a bottle for us? We'll pay a deposit, just name the price!
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: What? Why sell the good stuff at a low price? Shouldn't the best grapes be the most expensive?
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Wow, Master Diluc's such a thoughtful guy...
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: So, is Diluc picking out this year's grapes right now?
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: "Unsavory guests"? What is that supposed to mean...?
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 09a 1.ogg Paimon: Huh? You mean the Darkn—
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 09a 2.ogg Paimon: Uhhhh... the dark 'n' evil Abyss Order are up to no good again?
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 09a 3.ogg Paimon: In that case — Master Diluc's our friend, we can't sit here and do nothing!
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 09b 1.ogg Paimon: Ummm... But Paimon will feel kinda bad if we're sitting in Diluc's house twiddling our thumbs while he's out there hard at work.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 09b 2.ogg Paimon: Let's go to Falcon Coast and help Diluc sort out his issues.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 09b 3.ogg Paimon: Although Diluc is super strong, surely he'd appreciate a little support.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: No biggie! The sooner Master Diluc is free, the sooner we can get a taste of that delicious grape juice, hehe.
Media:vo hyeq001 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Come on, (Traveler), let's go to the Falcon Coast!
Media:vo hyeq001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Is that a camp over there? Diluc is camping out in the wild!?
Media:vo hyeq001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh... This is weird... Hmm... Maybe these enemies are really tough, and it's turned into a long, drawn-out battle?
Media:vo hyeq001 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Let's go check it out!
Media:vo hyeq001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ha... This tent doesn't look like it belongs to Diluc. Maybe it's an adventurer camp?
Media:vo hyeq001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, there's a piece of paper and a notebook over there. Let's read them.
Media:vo hyeq001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm... judging by the tone, it seems like this was written by someone Diluc knows well. Let's call him "Diluc's friend" for now.
Media:vo hyeq001 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: He saw something bad happen, wrote a note for Master Diluc, and then left.
Media:vo hyeq001 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh... Isn't that pretty irresponsible? What if someone else had seen it? Also, he left his notebook behind...
Media:vo hyeq001 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Mmm... Now that Paimon thinks about it... you know that strange ley line deposit on the beach?
Media:vo hyeq001 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Other than that, everything seems fine here... not a monster in sight.
Media:vo hyeq001 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: (Traveler), do you wanna read Diluc's friend's notebook, too?
Media:vo hyeq001 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: If not, let's head over and take a closer look at the ley line deposit.
Media:vo hyeq001 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa! Where did all these monsters come from!?
Media:vo hyeq001 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh.. Wait a second... Is that Diluc?
Media:vo hyeq001 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh... He looks kinda different than usual...
Media:vo hyeq001 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Look at him go! So focused and full of energy! So this is Captain Pyro when he's in top form, huh!
Media:vo hyeq001 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hey, you're right! Now that Paimon looks more closely, this Diluc does look younger than usual.
Media:vo hyeq001 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: But what happened back then? Why was he fighting here?
Media:vo hyeq001 5 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Hmm. Guess we can just ask him about it when we see him.
Media:vo hyeq001 5 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: What should we do now, (Traveler)?
Media:vo hyeq001 5 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Okay, let's see how young Diluc used to fight.
Media:vo hyeq001 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: The fight is over. Diluc wiped the floor with them... Guess some things haven't changed.
Media:vo hyeq001 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So is there any actual danger here? It looks like it's only these illusions from the past.
Media:vo hyeq001 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So, Diluc's already called it a day?
Media:vo hyeq001 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Will more monsters come out if we go up to that weird ley line deposit again? And what about young Diluc?
Media:vo hyeq001 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: If it's like the other ley line deposits we've seen, then it should've disappeared now that all the monsters are defeated.
Media:vo hyeq001 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: No, no, hehe, Paimon's just a little worried is all.
Media:vo hyeq001 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: What if someone passing by gets curious, comes to check it out, then suddenly "Yaah!" A monster jumps out and clubs him over the head with a "swish" and a "smash"? That would be terrible.
Media:vo hyeq001 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: ...Because it sounds more dangerous that way!
Media:vo hyeq001 6 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Anyway, we came here to help Diluc, didn't we? So let's stick around a little longer and make sure this place is completely safe before we head back.
Media:vo hyeq001 6 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Hehe... Not really. Paimon just wants some fancy grape juice.
Media:vo hyeq001 6 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Come on, (Traveler), let's finish what we came for. When we get the grape juice, you can have some of Paimon's half!
Media:vo hyeq002 25 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: There are two notes here. Which one shall we start with?
Media:vo hyeq002 25 paimon 02a.ogg Paimon: Paimon didn't follow all of that. Eh, but it seemed to be about a previous battle Diluc was in?
Media:vo hyeq002 25 paimon 02b.ogg Paimon: Huh? Sounds like it was talking about Albedo. Did Diluc write a letter to Albedo?
Someone's Notes: "Although you fully resolved the issue last time, the ley lines seem to have been stimulated in some way and are releasing the monsters they recorded once more."
Someone's Notes: "Dear Darknight Hero, we are seeing a repeat of the phenomenon we encountered many years ago."
