 Quest DescriptionBernhard has heard that you are participating in the Fecund Hamper event...
Bernhard: Besides, I'm sure the gift givers would be happy to see their sincere gifts being used in your shop.
Bernhard: Haha, there are indeed people who would prepare those as gifts. Right, since we're running a snack shop, do you want to put some of those decorations here?
Bernhard: Hello, Traveler, Paimon. I've heard that you've been participating in the Fecund Hamper event. Was it fun?
Bernhard: Prettying the shop up could help us attract more customers.
Paimon: Good point! C'mon, (Traveler), let's decorate our shop!
Paimon: It's been pretty fun! Paimon isn't sure if it's because there was this market during Weinlesefest, but we got all sorts of decorations.
