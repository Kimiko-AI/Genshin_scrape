 Quest DescriptionYou meet a strange Seelie on Minacious Isle...
Paimon: Eh? Where did these Anemo Slimes drop down from?
Paimon: Huh, so it really came back to Mondstadt. Guess it must be from around these parts.
Paimon: Let's keep chasing that Seelie before it gets too far!
Paimon: Look up! Something just appeared!
Paimon: Looks like it's time for you-know-what again...
Paimon: Looks like there's something recorded here, too. Paimon wonders what purpose it serves...
Paimon: Maybe it might have something to do with these Elemental Monuments. Let's go back and have a look.
Paimon: Never mind, let's keep following that Seelie. It's getting away!
Paimon: Paimon remembers that that stone tablet had something recorded on it.
Paimon: Paimon was just thinking we'd never find a Seelie on this island, and then, Seelie surprise!
Paimon: Same drill as always, let's approach it and see where it leads us.
Paimon: So how did it get to that island, then? So many questions...
Paimon: That Seelie flew right in!
Paimon: That Seelie's stopped. Is this where it intended to come all along?
Paimon: That doesn't seem right...
Paimon: There's gotta be a pile of stones, or a stone tablet, or an elemental monument around here somewhere.
Paimon: There's nothing but debris around here... Let's help clean the place up a little.
Paimon: Whoa, it's a Seelie!
Paimon: Whoa, things lit up all of a sudden!
Paimon: Why has it stopped? There's nothing here...
