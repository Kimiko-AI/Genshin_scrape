 What's left of the Thunderbird's wrath...
Media:vo clwq001 8 bigmeatmaru 04.ogg Miitoboru: Well blow me down... Just a fraction of the Thunderbird's wrath, and yet still so powerful...
Media:vo clwq001 8 bigmeatmaru 05.ogg Miitoboru: Wait! But the lightning came from Seirai Island... (Traveler), have you ever been there? Do you know what happened to the island after that?

Media:vo clwq001 7 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Paimon has no idea. It was really scary, though.
Media:vo clwq001 7 bigmeatmaru 05.ogg Miitoboru: Wait... So that thunderstorm was the reason I... the reason I drifted here. Aye, I was terribly injured in that storm. My whole body was falling apart...
 (Show the picture of the shipwreck...)
 (Show the wooden musical instrument...)
 (Strike the intact part of the musical instrument...)
 But they said goodbye to you with a smile...
 Does that really matter?
 Excellent work, Paimon.
 Finding your memory is the most important thing.
 Friends don't do deals.
 He had you at "treasure," huh?
 Hmph, Miitoboru!
 I had a feeling that might swing it for you.
 I think it actually might be the wooden sword...
 I think you hit the wooden strips with the mallet...
 I'm sure they'll be fine.
 I... may have heard of them?
 It doesn't matter.
 It is possible.
Media:vo clwq001 4 paimon 05b.ogg Paimon: Huh... Not only did it break into two pieces, but the parts are also completely tattered...
 It's fine either way.
 Just like how people need a good rest once in a while.
 Maybe boats have a special platonic bond that draws them together.
Media:vo clwq001 4 paimon 05a.ogg Paimon: What does that mean? ...Ohhh, like they're ship-friends?
 Never heard of them.
 Of course!
 Paimon is right.
 Paimon is the best companion one could ask for!
 Paimon is the best guide in all of Teyvat!
 Quest DescriptionMiitoboru, a waverider who claims himself to be a mighty pirate ship, seems to have something to discuss with you...
 Somewhere in between the two.
 Step DescriptionFollow Miitoboru's intuition and search for treasures out at sea.
 Step DescriptionIt seems that what Miitoboru has sensed is not the priates' "treasure," but peices of his own body. Although there is no more treasure, it would be nice to help him fulfill his wish of "retrieving his own body."
 That's how partings go, I guess...
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 13a.ogg Miitoboru: Aye... I still feel the sadness now that I remember it, even after all this time.
 That's nonsense.
 The island full of raven statues...
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 06a.ogg Miitoboru: Hmm... Now that you mention it, I do sense the cawing of ravens coming from over there...
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 06a 1.ogg Miitoboru: But not just the sound of ravens, no... there be music as well...
 The island where musical flowers grow...
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 06b.ogg Miitoboru: Musical flowers, hmm? Indeed... among the sounds I'm sensing, I hear music drifting across the sea...
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 06b 1.ogg Miitoboru: But not just the sound of music, no... there's the non-stop cawing of ravens, too...
 Then it's perfect for Paimon.
 There are other possibilities.
 This is a musical instrument...
 Treasure isn't the be-all and end-all...
 Wait, this plank...
 Was that someone's memory?
 We'd be delighted.
 What's left of the Thunderbird's wrath...
 Whatever the booty, we'll take it!
 You mean they're... wood-relatives?
 Your excuses are so lame...
"Don't cry. How can we say goodbye to it when we are crying?"
"Give up, Zaemon! Surrender now, and I'll spare your life!"
"I am Zaemon! The Deathless Oni of Seirai!"
"I am a proud seaman, and I will never live in the mercy of my enemy!"
"I hope this ship will bring you back safely, so I shall name it after this place..."
"Shrine Maiden, it's another mighty ship! It deserves a nice name!"
A feeling hits you the moment you touch the plank.
A feeling strikes you when you touch the wooden sword.
A newly painted hull, glowing in the warm rays of the sun.
A powerful force dragging you downward, faster and faster...
A tremendous impact, followed by the sound of something heavy descending and floating up again.
Ah, if we're going to sing, don't be quietly wiping away the tears...
All of a sudden, you realize that this is the sea...
An enemy jumps onto the deck, making the ship lurch.
And he is answered by a helpless sigh...
And that's where you'll be drifting for the rest of your life...
At this very moment, the man holding a barbed spear looks surprisingly calm and determined.
Dozens of hands pulling towlines.
If you're going to sing, smile and be happy...
Is it because you have to go back without me?
Me hearties, why are you looking at me like that?
Media:vo clwq001 1 bigmeatmaru 01.ogg Miitoboru: Ahoy there! You're finally here. I've been waiting for a long time. Even my deck is getting burrs.
Media:vo clwq001 1 bigmeatmaru 02.ogg Miitoboru: But this boat... does this boat even have a deck? This is a dinghy at most, haha.
Media:vo clwq001 1 bigmeatmaru 03.ogg Miitoboru: Who would've thought that I, the notorious pirate ship commanded by Ako Domeki would one day end up like this.
Media:vo clwq001 1 bigmeatmaru 04.ogg Miitoboru: What? You don't even know who Ako Domeki is?
Media:vo clwq001 1 bigmeatmaru 05.ogg Miitoboru: Ako Domeki Zaemon? Defender of Seirai? The name of the most feared pirate ever to sail the seas... *sigh* Who would've thought...
Media:vo clwq001 1 bigmeatmaru 06.ogg Miitoboru: It feels so weird being called that all of a sudden. Ugh... You see, as I said, I'm here because I drifted here...
Media:vo clwq001 1 bigmeatmaru 07.ogg Miitoboru: So I'm thinking my original body must be nearby... It feels strange using the word "body," haha... but I do need to find it as soon as possible.
Media:vo clwq001 1 bigmeatmaru 08.ogg Miitoboru: I've lost track of how long I've been sleeping here, but I'm certain my companions will still be waiting for me. I need to find my body, get shipshape, and return to them as soon as possible!
Media:vo clwq001 1 bigmeatmaru 09.ogg Miitoboru: Aye, but I can't make it there on my own. After all, a talking ship is just a ship. It still needs someone at the wheel.
Media:vo clwq001 1 bigmeatmaru 10.ogg Miitoboru: Let's make a deal. You help me find my body, and I will help you find treasure in return!
Media:vo clwq001 1 bigmeatmaru 11.ogg Miitoboru: I'm a pirate ship after all! Call it a pirate ship's intuition, or some kind of sixth sense — either way, the moment I woke up, I could sense that this area is filled with valuable treasures.
Media:vo clwq001 1 bigmeatmaru 12.ogg Miitoboru: You have my word, a pirate ship always finds its treasure, argh! Or may I be blighted with barnacles! What say ye, me hearties — do we have an accord?
Media:vo clwq001 1 bigmeatmaru 13.ogg Miitoboru: So, (Traveler)... Will you help me, or not?
Media:vo clwq001 1 bigmeatmaru 14.ogg Miitoboru: Great! Well, there's a place I wanted to go to as soon as I woke up. Based on my pirate ship's intuition, there's be some big treasure hidden there! Argh! Let's head there and search for it!
Media:vo clwq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So you're a big pirate ship? But who's Ako Domeki?
Media:vo clwq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Nope, the name doesn't ring a bell... Alright Miitoboru, you told us to come here, so tell us... What is this all about?
Media:vo clwq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Right...
Media:vo clwq001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Treasure!
Media:vo clwq001 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: (Traveler), let's help Miitoboru. If he finds his body and we get treasure in return, everybody wins!
Media:vo clwq001 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hee-hee... (Traveler)...
Media:vo clwq001 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Time to set sail!
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 01.ogg Miitoboru: You're back. How did it go? Did you find anything?
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 02.ogg Miitoboru: This is indeed my last piece... But what the festering fishbait have they turned me into this time?
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 03.ogg Miitoboru: It that so? Argh, a pity, to be sure. Musical instrument... Hehe, I never imagine that my broken body could be used to play music...
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 04.ogg Miitoboru: It makes me think of my old mates... They used to sing when the mood took them...
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 05.ogg Miitoboru: They'd sit by the beach, facing the campfire... Hey, what kind of sound does this instrument make? Why don't you give it a try. (Traveler)?
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 06.ogg Miitoboru: It doesn't matter. Satisfy my curiosity! Just strike it and see what happens, (Traveler).
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 07.ogg Miitoboru: Argh...
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 08.ogg Miitoboru: Aye... But since I was so badly damaged, it was the most I could do to bring them here. There was no way I could go back with them.
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 09.ogg Miitoboru: Ah... It gladdens my heart to know that they are safe, but I... Even though I said goodbye to them, I still can't help thinking, what if I could have gone back with them...
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 10.ogg Miitoboru: Oh, how I wish we had returned together. With them, I would have been willing to go anywhere, no matter how dangerous...
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 11.ogg Miitoboru: There are so many grand adventures for us to go on, so many treasures out there in the world, waiting for us to discover them.
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 12.ogg Miitoboru: Why did I have to be left here, abandoned like this? I could do nothing but watch them leave and embark on a new journey... without me.
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 13a.ogg Miitoboru: Aye... I still feel the sadness now that I remember it, even after all this time.
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 13b.ogg Miitoboru: Laugh when you feel like crying, and press on when you feel like giving up. That's how you survive out on the ocean.
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 14.ogg Miitoboru: Anyway, thank you for helping me remember all of this, thank you kindly. I'm afraid, though, that they seem to have taken most of the treasure with them when they left...
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 15.ogg Miitoboru: Aye, it's true. Tis a shame I can't repay your kindness... As a ship, there's only so much I can do...
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 16.ogg Miitoboru: But, um... In the future, if I ever need your help again...
Media:vo clwq001 10 bigmeatmaru 17.ogg Miitoboru: Fantastic, thank you both! And if you ever voyage in these seas again, I will be your trusty companion!
Media:vo clwq001 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We think it's a musical instrument! But it hasn't been fixed for a while, so you can't really play anything with it...
Media:vo clwq001 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh... it hasn't been caulked for a long time, so it might not sound as good as you're hoping.
Media:vo clwq001 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So they found a way back...
Media:vo clwq001 10 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Yeah! In a way, all the things you sensed really were invaluable treasures — to you, at least!
Media:vo clwq001 10 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: We'll be here for you whenever you need us, Miitoboru! Right, (Traveler)?
Media:vo clwq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: The place Miitoboru has sensed is right up there...
Media:vo clwq001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Okay, let's go check it out, (Traveler)!
Media:vo clwq001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Is this really the right place? There's nothing here but a shipwreck...
Media:vo clwq001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Miitoboru had better not be lying to us... Guess it's time to go back and ask our friend a couple of questions, (Traveler)!
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 01.ogg Miitoboru: How did it go? Did you find anything valuable?
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 02.ogg Miitoboru: What? No, impossible...
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 03.ogg Miitoboru: Ah, I know! It must be because I have been sleeping for too long, and my intuition is not as sharp as it once was. Uhhh, as the saying goes, nobody's perfect, and certainly no boat's perfect either, right? Cut me a little slack, huh...
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 04.ogg Miitoboru: The next place will be the one... I'm sure the next place will be full of treasure...
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 05.ogg Miitoboru: You have my word! ...But, um... the next place is a little far away, and I'm not sure of the precise location. All I know is that... it's somewhere northwest of here...
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 06a 1.ogg Miitoboru: But not just the sound of ravens, no... there be music as well...
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 06a.ogg Miitoboru: Hmm... Now that you mention it, I do sense the cawing of ravens coming from over there...
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 06b 1.ogg Miitoboru: But not just the sound of music, no... there's the non-stop cawing of ravens, too...
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 06b.ogg Miitoboru: Musical flowers, hmm? Indeed... among the sounds I'm sensing, I hear music drifting across the sea...
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 07.ogg Miitoboru: To be precise, the "cawing" is coming from the east, and the "music" is coming from the southwest.
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 08.ogg Miitoboru: Argh! Then let's go over and take a look! Hahahaha...
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 09.ogg Miitoboru: You know... I must say, it seems you two are quite close.
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 10.ogg Miitoboru: Argh... if only I'd been able to speak back when we were sailing on the sea, then maybe I would've been able to communicate with my companions just like you two...
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 11.ogg Miitoboru: You seem to have so much fun together, I'm a little jealous.
Media:vo clwq001 3 bigmeatmaru 12.ogg Miitoboru: Alright! Time to find the center location of these two big islands!
Media:vo clwq001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmph, Miitoboru!
Media:vo clwq001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: There is nothing on this island except for a shipwreck. What kind of intuition is that?
Media:vo clwq001 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: It'd better be! No more playing tricks on us this time!
Media:vo clwq001 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: But there are so many islands in the northwest! You gotta give us a little more than that!
Media:vo clwq001 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Wait a minute... If you mean one of the larger islands, there are only two of them in the northwest.
Media:vo clwq001 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: So you're hearing two sounds? Ugh... where could this darn treasure be...
Media:vo clwq001 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: But where can you hear the sounds from both islands at the same time...?
Media:vo clwq001 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Oh, you're right, (Traveler)... Yup! That's exactly what Paimon was thinking too!
Media:vo clwq001 3 paimon 09a.ogg Paimon: You bet! We've been on loads of adventures together and found lots of treasure before!
Media:vo clwq001 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Hee-hee...
Media:vo clwq001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Here we are, this is right in between both islands.
Media:vo clwq001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: There'd better be some treasure this time.
Media:vo clwq001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Well, surprise, surprise... There's nothing here either, except yet another shipwreck... well, half a shipwreck, anyway.
Media:vo clwq001 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Was there no treasure this whole time? Um... Oh... But wait, both times Miitoboru thought he was sensing treasure, it turned out to be shipwrecks... Does that mean this is his body!?
Media:vo clwq001 4 paimon 05a.ogg Paimon: What does that mean? ...Ohhh, like they're ship-friends?
Media:vo clwq001 4 paimon 05b.ogg Paimon: Huh... Not only did it break into two pieces, but the parts are also completely tattered...
Media:vo clwq001 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hey, (Traveler), why don't we take a picture of the boat and show it to Miitoboru...
Media:vo clwq001 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Then he can confirm whether it's his body or not!
Media:vo clwq001 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: We have the pictures! Come on, let's go back and show them to Miitoboru, (Traveler).
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 01.ogg Miitoboru: There you are, how did it go? Did you find something? Let me guess, you found a huge—
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 02.ogg Miitoboru: *sigh* A huge load of nothing? Ugh... I dropped the cannonball again, didn't I?
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 03.ogg Miitoboru: Is this a painting? I didn't know you two could paint so well. Just look at the detail, down to the smallest blade of grass... It's just like the real thing!
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 04.ogg Miitoboru: So it was drawn by a machine, through some high-speed mechanism...
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 05.ogg Miitoboru: What are you trying to say? It's not like I haven't seen similar things before. It's just like the Hell Paintings in all those legends.
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 06.ogg Miitoboru: But anyway, what's that thing in the middle of this... picture?
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 07.ogg Miitoboru: ...
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 08.ogg Miitoboru: Ha, impossible! Where did this sorry ship come from? It's a total wreck.
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 09.ogg Miitoboru: You may not know this, but I'm considered as the mightiest pirate ship of the Ako Domeki fleet. My hull is made of the best wood found on Seirai Island.
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 10.ogg Miitoboru: The edges of my frame boards were refined with folding saws so that the pieces fit together perfectly. Then they were joined together and reinforced with large rivets, making me indestructible... There's no way I could end up like this!
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 11.ogg Miitoboru: It's probably because of the special bond between all boats that draws us to one another. Before they ran aground, these ships may well have been self-aware too. The remnants of their spirit is most likely what I sensed.
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 12.ogg Miitoboru: Anyway, this can't be my body... My body is probably docked at a hidden port somewhere in these waters.
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 13.ogg Miitoboru: You'll see... My side panels are painted with the finest lacquer. Argh, what a majestic sight I used to be.
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 14.ogg Miitoboru: Once we find it, you'll realize how different I am from this shipwreck in your picture.
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 15.ogg Miitoboru: Argh, that's for sure!
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 16.ogg Miitoboru: I can't believe I sensed the wrong thing twice in a row... The lack of maintenance has really taken the wind out of my sails as far as my intuition goes.
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 17.ogg Miitoboru: You have to apply caulk once in a while if you want a long-lasting voyage. That goes for people, too.
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 18.ogg Miitoboru: Haha, Paimon, you're a funny one, aren't you. No, but you're not that far off!
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 19.ogg Miitoboru: Caulk is the stuff we use to fill the gaps between the planks to stop water from leaking into the ship. It's made of rubber or something. Every once in a while, you gotta caulk the gaps as part of the maintenance!
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 20.ogg Miitoboru: Exactly. Which reminds me, I got some good rest when you two went on that little adventure, I'm sure I'll be able to sense where the real treasure is now!
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 21.ogg Miitoboru: Third time's the charm! Time to get serious. We'll definitely find something this time!
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 22.ogg Miitoboru: What's wrong, Paimon? You don't sound like you believe me...
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 23.ogg Miitoboru: Anyway... This time, I sense something in the southeast, on the sea surface. It doesn't feel like something very big. And that raises the chances of it being a small but valuable item, hahaha.
Media:vo clwq001 5 bigmeatmaru 24.ogg Miitoboru: Come on, let's go!
Media:vo clwq001 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Miitoboru!
Media:vo clwq001 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Same as last time. Just another shipwreck.
Media:vo clwq001 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Maybe they're parts of your body? We took pictures of them, take a look!
Media:vo clwq001 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: We didn't paint this. We took it using a Kamera.
Media:vo clwq001 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So, even the mighty pirate ship has never seen a Kamera before!
Media:vo clwq001 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: That's the shipwreck we found... Take a look! Could it be... your body?
Media:vo clwq001 5 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: But your intuition led us to shipwrecks twice in a row...
Media:vo clwq001 5 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: That sounds great! We should go for a cruise together sometime.
Media:vo clwq001 5 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: What the heck is "caulk"? Is it the glue that holds all the parts of the ship together?
Media:vo clwq001 5 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Paimon sure hopes so... Anything will do at this point...
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 01.ogg Miitoboru: Surely you found something this time!
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 02.ogg Miitoboru: Have I finally convinced you of this mighty pirate ship's razor-sharp treasure-hunting senses!
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 03.ogg Miitoboru: Oh... just, uh, just the two, you say?
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 04.ogg Miitoboru: Ahem, Paimon, you may not be aware, but the mightier the pirate ship, the longer its voyage at sea, you see... Eventually, the only food available onboard is dry fish...
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 05.ogg Miitoboru: At times like this, a couple of bird eggs on a reef nearby can easily become the most valuable treasure to a crew.
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 06.ogg Miitoboru: Okay, fine... But how the heck did I end up sensing eggs? How strange...
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 07.ogg Miitoboru: I swear I sensed something!
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 08.ogg Miitoboru: *sigh*...
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 09.ogg Miitoboru: I know where this plank comes from. (Traveler), Paimon, what you saw just now was my own memory.
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 10.ogg Miitoboru: It was my first time sailing on the sea after I was built. The crew used greased planks to create a slipway, then launched me into the water...
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 11.ogg Miitoboru: The thing is, it's really hard to control the angle at which the bow launches onto the water. It could very well break if you're not careful, which is why most people choose to launch the ship sideways instead.
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 12.ogg Miitoboru: These two planks... Or should I say, these two side panels... They must have been the first parts of my body to make contact with the water.
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 13.ogg Miitoboru: ...Maybe I crashed into the reef here and was shattered to pieces long ago... And maybe the sensation I had when I woke up wasn't some kind of treasure-hunting intuition after all, but me responding to my own body...
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 14.ogg Miitoboru: There I was, making fun of that shipwreck, blissfully unaware that I was actually making fun of my own body. Haha... Ah, how embarrassing.
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 15.ogg Miitoboru: But...
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 16.ogg Miitoboru: I... *sigh* Thank you, both of you...
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 17.ogg Miitoboru: ...It's a pity, but I'm afraid I didn't see much more than you did. I still can't recall my name...
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 18.ogg Miitoboru: It's not too bad! You and (Traveler) can keep calling me Miitoboru. It's a good name!
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 19.ogg Miitoboru: Although I can sense two more places... I fear it will be the same situation as before. No treasures, only some driftwood...
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 20.ogg Miitoboru: Argh... but I swore there'd be treasure in this deal for you...
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 21.ogg Miitoboru: Well, in that case... Whether it's treasure or not, let's hope you two can find something rather than nothing there.
Media:vo clwq001 6 bigmeatmaru 22.ogg Miitoboru: Haha, good! Let's go to the closer location first!
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Miitoboru felt like it should be somewhere around here. Hmm... could it be this reef?
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It looks kinda small... but let's go check it out anyway, (Traveler)!
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: All there was was a bird's nest...
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: So yeah, technically there were a couple of eggs... but that was all.
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Really? So this is the valuable treasure you were talking about?
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Miitoboru...
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: But there's nothing else on the reef...
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Could it be these two planks? Seems like they were used as a shelter. Paimon wonders where they came from...
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: What happened? What was that?
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Miitoboru... If your side panels are here, does that mean...
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: We don't know that for sure! Maybe... maybe your body is still in one piece! Yeah, these two planks are probably just, um... part of your... family tree!
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Yup, could share the same roots! Even it's if not, there are loads of shipwrecks around here. These planks probably just belong to one of them.
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: By the way, Miitoboru, wasn't there something about your name mentioned in that memory? Do you remember your name now?
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Oh, that's a shame...
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Hee-hee, of course it is, Paimon picked it, after all. So, Miitoboru, is there anywhere else you want to go?
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: It doesn't matter!
Media:vo clwq001 6 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Hey, it's okay, Miitoboru... we're friends now!
Media:vo clwq001 7 bigmeatmaru 01.ogg Miitoboru: Yup, this is the place. The location I sensed is around here. I wonder what you'll find this time... well, I'll leave it to you!
Media:vo clwq001 7 bigmeatmaru 02.ogg Miitoboru: The thing I sensed... Could it be this wooden sword?
Media:vo clwq001 7 bigmeatmaru 03.ogg Miitoboru: Shiver me timbers!!! I remember now. The sea battle between Ako Domeki and the Shogunate. And then the lightning that came at the end of the battle...
Media:vo clwq001 7 bigmeatmaru 04.ogg Miitoboru: *sigh*... What could it have been?
Media:vo clwq001 7 bigmeatmaru 05.ogg Miitoboru: Wait... So that thunderstorm was the reason I... the reason I drifted here. Aye, I was terribly injured in that storm. My whole body was falling apart...
Media:vo clwq001 7 bigmeatmaru 06.ogg Miitoboru: It took all my strength to get here.
Media:vo clwq001 7 bigmeatmaru 07.ogg Miitoboru: Zaemon once seized a sword-wielding Maguu with his barbed spear. The Maguu drifted here with us. The wooden sword was probably crafted by local children, imitating the Maguu's sword...
Media:vo clwq001 7 bigmeatmaru 08.ogg Miitoboru: The body of the mighty pirate ship that once fought against the Shogunate, now reduced to a children's toy, of all things... Argh... my mind is awash with strange and complex feelings.
Media:vo clwq001 7 bigmeatmaru 09.ogg Miitoboru: ...No, there's no point taking this now. Hmph, young scallywags... the little landlubbers got me this time!
Media:vo clwq001 7 bigmeatmaru 10.ogg Miitoboru: ...*sigh* Although it's disappointing now that I remember the truth, somehow I feel relieved, too... At least I know what happened. I won't be deceiving myself with my wishful thinking any longer.
Media:vo clwq001 7 bigmeatmaru 11.ogg Miitoboru: The only thing I'm worried about now is my old mateys who drifted here with me... I wish I could know how they're doing.
Media:vo clwq001 7 bigmeatmaru 12.ogg Miitoboru: Aye, let's hope so... Okay, there's one last place...
Media:vo clwq001 7 bigmeatmaru 13.ogg Miitoboru: I can feel it... it's the last piece of my body.
Media:vo clwq001 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Let's start by taking a look along the coast, (Traveler).
Media:vo clwq001 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Sure enough, no treasure here...
Media:vo clwq001 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Paimon knows that! ...Paimon just can't help feeling a little disappointed, that's all...
Media:vo clwq001 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: There's a wooden sword here. It looks like a children's toy...
Media:vo clwq001 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hey!
Media:vo clwq001 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Surely it couldn't be a wooden sword...
Media:vo clwq001 7 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Wow, that lightning was really powerful! What's this memory about?
Media:vo clwq001 7 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Paimon can still feel her head spinning...
Media:vo clwq001 7 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Paimon has no idea. It was really scary, though.
Media:vo clwq001 7 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Aw, Miitoboru... But what about the wooden sword? What does this have to do with it?
Media:vo clwq001 7 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: So Miitoboru, should we take this with us? After all... it is a part of you...
Media:vo clwq001 8 bigmeatmaru 04.ogg Miitoboru: Well blow me down... Just a fraction of the Thunderbird's wrath, and yet still so powerful...
Media:vo clwq001 8 bigmeatmaru 05.ogg Miitoboru: Wait! But the lightning came from Seirai Island... (Traveler), have you ever been there? Do you know what happened to the island after that?
Media:vo clwq001 8 bigmeatmaru 06.ogg Miitoboru: No... I can't believe it... It was a truly terrible thunderstorm, it was... ah, I don't have the words to describe the horror of it.
Media:vo clwq001 8 bigmeatmaru 06.ogg Miitoboru: No... I can't believe it... It was a truly terrible thunderstorm, it was... ah, I don't have the words to describe the horror of it.
Media:vo clwq001 8 bigmeatmaru 07.ogg Miitoboru: We stood up against the Shogunate precisely because we did not want our homeland to be ruled by them. We wanted to protect the people of Seirai Island...
Media:vo clwq001 8 bigmeatmaru 08.ogg Miitoboru: We made an enemy of the Shogunate for the sake of Seirai Island, and in the end... Oh, Shrine Maiden... Why...
Media:vo clwq001 8 bigmeatmaru 09.ogg Miitoboru: Wait... So that thunderstorm was the reason I... the reason I drifted here. Aye, I was terribly injured in that storm. My whole body was falling apart...
Media:vo clwq001 8 bigmeatmaru 07.ogg Miitoboru: We stood up against the Shogunate precisely because we did not want our homeland to be ruled by them. We wanted to protect the people of Seirai Island...
Media:vo clwq001 8 bigmeatmaru 08.ogg Miitoboru: We made an enemy of the Shogunate for the sake of Seirai Island, and in the end... Oh, Shrine Maiden... Why...
Media:vo clwq001 8 bigmeatmaru 09.ogg Miitoboru: Wait... So that thunderstorm was the reason I... the reason I drifted here. Aye, I was terribly injured in that storm. My whole body was falling apart...
Media:vo clwq001 8 bigmeatmaru 11.ogg Miitoboru: This wooden sword... is made from my broken timber...
Media:vo clwq001 9 bigmeatmaru 01.ogg Miitoboru: Aye, most surely. The precise location seems to be in that house on the beach... Wait, why a house? Don't tell me some landlubbers turned me into furniture...
Media:vo clwq001 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Is the last place somewhere around here?
Media:vo clwq001 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: There are a lot of wooden planks on this conch house... But they don't look like what we're after...
Media:vo clwq001 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh! Could it be the one on the stone?
Media:vo clwq001 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: What is it, though? A board nailed onto two wooden strips, with a wooden mallet next to it...
Media:vo clwq001 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: This? Is a musical instrument? Can it really make a decent sound?
Media:vo clwq001 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: (Traveler), why don't we try it out first before giving it to Miitoboru?
Media:vo clwq001 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Paimon's pretty sure this instrument hasn't been repaired in a looong time...
Media:vo clwq001 9 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Well, (Traveler), this must be the last fragment of Miitoboru's body. Come on, let's go tell him!
Neither of them sees the far end of the battlefield.
Neither of them sees the purple lightning unfurling like a bird's wings and engulfing the sky.
One of you says. Everyone begins to sing.
Only an endless thunderstorm follows.
Rather than pain, you are overwhelmed by regret.
Suddenly, you are surrounded by the cold, freezing and suffocating.
Surrender? Impossible!
The Wooden Instrument: (The intact wood strips made a cool and crisp sound, while the damaged wood strips only made a muffled, heavy sound like ordinary wood...)
The cracks caused by the impacts from the battle are aching.
The feeling strikes you as you hear the crisp sound from the wooden instrument...
Then comes the hearty laugh of a man.
There is a blinding white flash, a roaring shockwave that overturns everything.
There is noise all around you... everywhere.
Until suddenly. Boom!
Waves several meters high slam against the side of the ship.
You have been drifting for a long time, and you are seriously damaged. You can't sail any further..."
You hit the wooden strips a few times...
You tell Miitoboru about what happened on Seirai Island...
Your body is thrown into the air as you are stripped of all sense of direction.
