 Because I have to hold my weapon.
 This way, I can protect you.
 He will approve of you, I know it.
 How are the fish?
 Klee seems particularly happy.
 Klee, I can't help you press it.
 Klee, you're my favoritest friend.
 Klee.
 Please make sure you stay safe.
 Quest DescriptionThanks to a joint effort, the party finds the key to solving the final riddle. The truth behind these islands is now within reach, but Klee seems to be more anxious than ever. What is the truth that has quietly sat in wait all this time?
 Then I'll be your helping hand.
 When you say "Now," I'll place it, alright?
 This way, I can protect you.
 We'll go with you.
 We've finished placing the scales.
 When you say "Now," I'll place it, alright?
 Will you feel lonely without your mother?
 Yep!
 Yup.
Media:vo eqyq004 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: The sun's rising. It should be about time to check on the fish.
Media:vo eqyq004 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's meet up with everyone first!
Media:vo eqyq004 10 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Please, don't look at me like that.
Media:vo eqyq004 10 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: If we'd solved the riddle at the beginning, then the game wouldn't have been much fun now, would it?
Media:vo eqyq004 10 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: This archipelago suits you... and Klee.
Media:vo eqyq004 10 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: Don't you think so? Summer, islands, ocean... even if it is essentially just an ocean playground. It's perfect for those on the move.
Media:vo eqyq004 10 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: You could spend a wonderful summer here.
Media:vo eqyq004 11 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: So this was Alice's handiwork all along! The letter I received certainly makes a lot more sense now.
Media:vo eqyq004 11 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: She's quite a remarkable person. You must meet her if you get the opportunity.
Media:vo eqyq004 11 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Even if she does bring her fair share of trouble with her... Then again, I don't mind trouble when it's interesting.
Media:vo eqyq004 11 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Huh? Did I ever guess what was going on, you ask?
Media:vo eqyq004 11 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Haha... not a chance. I'm much too naive, I was in the dark the whole time.
Media:vo eqyq004 12 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: So it was her all along. I might have known.
Media:vo eqyq004 12 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: Alice is the only one in all of Mondstadt that could've pulled this off.. Well, her and that bard.
Media:vo eqyq004 12 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Those letters were actually invitations. I guess that makes us the guests to the party.
Media:vo eqyq004 12 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: Hah... Which means that in her heart, we're all a bunch of children.
Media:vo eqyq004 12 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: I haven't been taken for a child in a long time. Hmph.
Media:vo eqyq004 13 razor 01.ogg Razor: I... not understand...
Media:vo eqyq004 13 razor 02.ogg Razor: But... feels warm.
Media:vo eqyq004 13 razor 03.ogg Razor: Like... like blanket. Soft. Warm.
Media:vo eqyq004 13 razor 04.ogg Razor: This is... mother feeling?
Media:vo eqyq004 13 razor 05.ogg Razor: Mother is... also lupical... very good.
Media:vo eqyq004 2 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Honorary Knight, over here!
Media:vo eqyq004 2 klee 01.ogg Klee: Catchy catchy fish!
Media:vo eqyq004 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ah! No, no!
Media:vo eqyq004 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: To keep Klee from blowing up the fish to pieces, perhaps it'd be better to let us catch the fish. After all, we're experts at collecting all manner of wildlife!
Media:vo eqyq004 2 qin 01.ogg Jean: As we suspected, they were drawn to the crystal.
Media:vo eqyq004 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: That's one!
Media:vo eqyq004 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We got two now. Just one more to go!
Media:vo eqyq004 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: And that's all of them! We should have all the fish scales now!
Media:vo eqyq004 4 klee 01a.ogg Media:vo eqyq004 4 klee 01b.ogg Klee: Mr./Miss Honorary Knight, are you going to place the fish scales?
Media:vo eqyq004 4 klee 02.ogg Klee: Too bad I can't reach that high...
Media:vo eqyq004 4 klee 03.ogg Klee: Okay!
Media:vo eqyq004 4 klee 04.ogg Klee: But actually... I don't really understand this part.
Media:vo eqyq004 4 klee 05a.ogg Klee: So if you place them for me, it'll be fine! I trust you!
Media:vo eqyq004 4 klee 06.ogg Klee: Okie dokie!
Media:vo eqyq004 4 klee 07.ogg Klee: I'm going to finally see you, Dodo-King! Hee-hee, time to see what you really look like!
Media:vo eqyq004 4 klee 08a.ogg Media:vo eqyq004 4 klee 08b.ogg Klee: You can do it, (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight! I'm cheering for you! Yay!
Media:vo eqyq004 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Then we'll place the fish scales and let Klee activate the final and most important mechanism.
Media:vo eqyq004 4 qin 01.ogg Jean: I must say, Klee's incredibly excited.
Media:vo eqyq004 5 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: ...
Media:vo eqyq004 5 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Why wouldn't he? You've always tried your best and have done a good job.
Media:vo eqyq004 5 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Klee, what's wrong?
Media:vo eqyq004 5 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Guys, don't say things like that... What if Dodo-King just wants to invite Klee to his house to chat? Or yes, maybe he already approves of Klee!
Media:vo eqyq004 5 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Perfect, I also want to see how strong the enemies on this island really are.
Media:vo eqyq004 5 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: No matter who the enemy is, as long as we're here, you don't have to be afraid.
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 01.ogg Klee: Yay, amazing! Hehehe, it's my turn now, right?
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 02.ogg Klee: Okay!
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 03.ogg Klee: Huh?
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 04.ogg Klee: Yep, I got it!
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 05.ogg Klee: ...
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 06.ogg Klee: I—I'm worried... What if Dodo-King really is in here?
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 07.ogg Klee: And what if he doesn't allow me to become Dodoco's family, or if I lose to him...
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 08.ogg Klee: Then Dodoco can't be with me, and Mom will be very sad too... Dodoco is my bestest friend that Mom ever gave me.
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 09.ogg Klee: I—I'm too scared to press it...
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 10a.ogg Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 10b.ogg Klee: (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight, can you press the button for me?
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 11.ogg Klee: Why?
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 12.ogg Klee: Will he really approve of me?
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 13.ogg Klee: Really?
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 14.ogg Klee: ...Alright!
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 15.ogg Klee: Leave this to me!
Media:vo eqyq004 5 klee 16.ogg Klee: Press, press... press the button!
Media:vo eqyq004 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Klee!
Media:vo eqyq004 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yep, we'll leave that mechanism over there to you, Klee!
Media:vo eqyq004 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Don't worry Klee, we've all got your back!
Media:vo eqyq004 5 qin 01.ogg Jean: Yes, we're all here for you.
Media:vo eqyq004 5 razor 01.ogg Razor: Go.
Media:vo eqyq004 5 razor 02.ogg Razor: I'm here.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: There seems to be something over there. Shall we take a look?
Media:vo eqyq004 6 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Klee's mother, Alice, is an extremely enigmatic and near-omnipotent sorceress. Don't be overly concerned. This is just her character.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Aunt Alice, the same as ever.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 01.ogg Dodo-King: Wicked girl of flame, you have finally arrived. I've waited far too long — how very boring!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 02.ogg Dodo-King: You dare face me, the overlord of the Dodo Clan, Dodo-King!? Such glorious courage!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 03.ogg Dodo-King: Though such courage is admirable, but it is now meaningless because...
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 04.ogg Alice: Because Dodo-King is me, your mother, Alice!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 05.ogg Alice: Klee and her fellow islanders, hey there!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 06.ogg Alice: So, how did you like it here? Was it fun? Summer skies and the ocean surf, mmm~ Quite the vacation, no?
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 07.ogg Alice: There's no use looking for me, I'm not actually near you. The speaking device on the platform before you is none other than my personal creation, the Alice Phonograph! I'm using it to convey a mother's love!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 08.ogg Alice: Hey, I didn't scare you all off, did I? Sorry, my Klee loves playing with all sorts of small toys. As her mother, I naturally want to support her.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 09.ogg Alice: It's a pity that I can't meet you, but I'll be watching your every move from afar, just as always.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 10.ogg Alice: You might find all of this a bit odd. Why would a mother so far from home expend so much effort to create such an aquatic wonderland?
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 11.ogg Alice: Ding ding ding! That's correct, I've personally been to those islands. I absolutely adore the ancient ruins and unique landscape. I prepared everything so you all could take part and enjoy the islands as well.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 12.ogg Alice: Hehe, are any of you saying bad things about me now?
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 13.ogg Alice: You must have been curious about what was behind those letters, the boats, the buoys, the energy shield...
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 14.ogg Alice: Mm-hmm~ Actually, I thought it was a lot of effort, but this was the only way to invite everyone here, am I right?
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 15.ogg Alice: The islands are just full of stories. The original inhabitants, shipwrecks, mystical machinery... Countless coincidences converge here. It would've been such a waste if I didn't make these arrangements.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 16.ogg Alice: Now let me guess... Everyone who received a letter should be present. Kaeya, Diluc, Razor, Jean, Barbara...
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 17a.ogg Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 17b.ogg Alice: And then there's the reliable and intelligent Albedo, and... the mysterious Traveler and (his/her) good companion, Paimon.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 18.ogg Alice: You were all invited by me to accompany Klee. Thank you all for allowing my daughter to have a memorable summer.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 19.ogg Alice: Everything on the islands is a gift for you all, as thanks for keeping my little Klee company. But when you hear this recording, I'll already be traveling in other faraway lands.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 20.ogg Alice: The life of a traveler is such haste and amusement. Haha, ask the traveler next to you and you'll know.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 21.ogg Alice: Now everyone, if you're trying to find some hidden meaning in all of this, I must tell you that the situation isn't as complicated as you may think.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 22.ogg Alice: The reason why I like the city of Mondstadt is that its freedom is exactly what my daughter and I could every hope for.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 23.ogg Alice: My wish is simple: I want Klee to grow up with a curious yet kind heart. As long as she so desires, she can do anything and go anywhere.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 24.ogg Alice: Ah, summer... Speaking of summer, when I went to those islands, it also happened to be summer. Sitting on the beach, listening to the waves roll against my feet, I thought of you.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 25.ogg Alice: Klee, you are a child of summer, a present to me from the sea and the wind. Mom is thankful for your birth and wanted to give you something.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 26.ogg Alice: So Mom dressed up these islands, transformed the ancient ruins into a summer park, and used the moniker of Dodo-King to invite you.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 27.ogg Alice: In another world, there are tales of a wondrous island named after golden apples. Known by many names, it embodies the majestic vistas conjured by human fantasy.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 28.ogg Alice: Mom loves that story and wanted you to enjoy the wonderful things in it, so Mom gave you sapphire waters, pearly sands, a fantastical paradise...
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 29.ogg Alice: For you and for those who love you.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 30.ogg Alice: Klee, just like Mom, you are of a race blessed with longevity. For us, time is like a gust of wind: moments come and end.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 31.ogg Alice: In such a long life, parents are but a child's first connection. Even though we don't want to be separated, there will come the day when you must walk your own path.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 32.ogg Alice: Klee, Mom will always love you, but there are also others by your side.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 33.ogg Alice: Friends who accompany you, teachers who educate you, people who are willing to stay on an island for you despite knowing how unusual it is...
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 34.ogg Alice: Ah, summer is for everyone. No matter how life changes, no matter how many things happen this year, summer will never disappear, just like the love between people.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 35.ogg Alice: From now on, regardless of wherever you go, I hope you never forget how many people in this world love you.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 36.ogg Alice: Oh, yes, be sure to listen to Mr. Albedo at home. Mom will regularly return to see you two. Actually, whenever I have a moment to spare, I sneak back to check on you and everyone else. Hee-hee, has no one noticed?
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 37.ogg Alice: Huh? Time's almost up, so I'll stop here. Right, right, I spent a lot of effort on this place, so you all must play your hearts out!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 alice 38.ogg Alice: Everyone, my darling Klee, see you next time~
Media:vo eqyq004 6 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Whoa, this entire island is like a massive gift box hidden beneath the energy shield...
Media:vo eqyq004 6 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Wait, what?
Media:vo eqyq004 6 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: So there were only three crystals... Light red like flower petals, light blue like ocean waves, light yellow like autumn leaves...
Media:vo eqyq004 6 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Uh, you can't be serious...
Media:vo eqyq004 6 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: It appears that mother and daughter are kindred spirits, both wild and free...
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 01.ogg Klee: Yes, I wanna look!
(The group approach the phonograph)
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 02.ogg Klee: Huh? Mom!?
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 03.ogg Klee: No, Mom's just like that!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 04.ogg Klee: Yep! Mom is the bestest mom!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 05.ogg Klee: Mom, we caught fish, sailed a boat, went swimming, and played a lot of things!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 06.ogg Klee: Everyone's been super duper amazing and very kind to me!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 07.ogg Klee: Next time, you can come with us and we can all play here again!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 08.ogg Klee: Bye, Mom!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 09.ogg Klee: Dodo-King was actually Mom. I don't know why, but I'm very happy!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 10.ogg Klee: It doesn't matter if it's Mom blowing up Mondstadt's main gate, or Mom getting grounded, or Mom writing weird letters. Klee loves her very much.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 11.ogg Klee: Nope. Mom is the most strongest mage, so she can keep me company no matter where she is. She never lets me feel lonely!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 12.ogg Klee: I love Mom thiiiiiiiiiis much!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 13a.ogg Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 13b.ogg Klee: (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight, do you love Klee?
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 14.ogg Klee: I also love you very much! You have to play with me lots here, or else Mom will be disappointed!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 15.ogg Klee: I still have a lot of Jumpy Dumpties and I brought Dodoco here, too. I'll take you swimming and fish blasting!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 klee 16.ogg Klee: Hey, come on~!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wait! Alice? The person who wrote the Teyvat Travel Guide!?
Media:vo eqyq004 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: These toys aren't small at all!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Klee's mother also seems to have quite the free spirit...
Media:vo eqyq004 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? N—No! Is she listening to us?
Media:vo eqyq004 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: What do you mean?
Media:vo eqyq004 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: It must be nice to have a mom who's such a character.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: You don't think Albedo knew from the start, do you...?
Media:vo eqyq004 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: It's always fun when we're with you, Klee!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Let's not keep Klee waiting. C'mon, let's go!
Media:vo eqyq004 6 qin 01.ogg Jean: Huh, this is... Wait, I must be confused. What is this!?
Media:vo eqyq004 6 qin 02.ogg Jean: It was actually Alice! How careless of me...
Media:vo eqyq004 6 qin 03.ogg Jean: No need to be so troubled.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 qin 04.ogg Jean: So Alice went to all these lengths because she was too busy to be with Klee?
Media:vo eqyq004 6 qin 05.ogg Jean: So that's it. We'll, I must admit that is certainly fits Alice's style. My apologies, I misunderstood.
Media:vo eqyq004 6 qin 06.ogg Jean: ...
Media:vo eqyq004 6 qin 07.ogg Jean: Perhaps from Alice's perspective, this archipelago is the natural fourth crystal. Located in the middle of the sea and covered by plant life, it truly is a lustrous and emerald "Summer Crystal."
Media:vo eqyq004 6 razor 01.ogg Razor: Klee's... M—Mother?
Media:vo eqyq004 7 qin 01.ogg Jean: I had no idea that any of this could have been Alice's creation.
Media:vo eqyq004 7 qin 02.ogg Jean: Now that I know the truth... there is a certain sweetness to the scenery all around us.
Media:vo eqyq004 7 qin 03.ogg Jean: Such a beautiful summer... what could be a better gift?
Media:vo eqyq004 7 qin 04.ogg Jean: Oh! Speaking of which... I still have a promise to keep to Klee. Those fish won't blast themselves.
Media:vo eqyq004 7 qin 05.ogg Jean: Traveler, would you like to take part in a bit of innocent recreation?
Media:vo eqyq004 8 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: It's amazing! This whole island... is actually a gift?
Media:vo eqyq004 8 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: ...Honorary Knight, I—I can't help but feel a little emotional. Of course, it wasn't my gift... but I just feel so moved by it all.
Media:vo eqyq004 8 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: When people spend a long time together, they become... more important to each other.
Media:vo eqyq004 8 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: *sigh* ...A good reminder. In fact, many things have become clearer to me now.
Media:vo eqyq004 9 klee 01.ogg Klee: Mommy is the bestest person in the whole-wide world! Albedo knows!
Media:vo eqyq004 9 klee 02a.ogg Media:vo eqyq004 9 klee 02b.ogg Klee: She knows everyone. I'm sure she knows (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight!
Media:vo eqyq004 9 klee 03.ogg Klee: Because... Mom can do anything!
Media:vo eqyq004 9 klee 04a.ogg Media:vo eqyq004 9 klee 04b.ogg Klee: When she comes back, we have to go and find her. She's a really good person, (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight will definitely like her!
Media:vo eqyq004 cs diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Hm?
Media:vo eqyq004 cs kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Huh?
Media:vo eqyq004 cs klee 01.ogg Klee: Yayyy!!! Dadada!
