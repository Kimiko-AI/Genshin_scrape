Paimon: (Traveler), there's something fishy about the Mirror Maiden...
Mirror Maiden: ...I have to get back... I have to get back... He's still there. But my brothers are gone, and their photo...
Paimon: Hey, Fatuus...
Mirror Maiden: The photo of my brothers... I can't go back if I lose it...
Paimon: Hey, you! Fatui person over there!
Mirror Maiden: No, I can't leave him behind... Mustn't leave him alone...
 She seems unwell...
 We aren't getting through to her...
Paimon: Now, pardon me, but I think we've seen this scene before...
 The Fatuus we met earlier...
Paimon: Right. When we met Chevka earlier, he was muttering about some "insignia" thing, and he came to his senses after we gave the insignia to him.
Paimon: The Fatui are doing experiments here that even affect their own people. Well, Paimon calls this "getting a taste of their own medicine"!
 That's right!
Paimon: So... This Mirror Maiden could be a member of Chevka's squad, right?
Paimon: Should we try to find something and get her to regain her senses?
Mirror Maiden: The photo of myself and my brothers... I can't go back if I can't find it. But he's still there, waiting for me, all alone...

Paimon: Why are the Fatui here? This Mirror Maiden...
Paimon: They're not up to something again, are they?
Mirror Maiden: ...I have to get back... I have to get back... He's still there. But my brothers are gone, and their photo...
Paimon: Hey, who are you? What are you doing over here?
Mirror Maiden: The photo of my brothers... I can't go back if I lose it...
Paimon: Hey, you! Fatui person over there!
Mirror Maiden: No, I can't leave him behind... Mustn't leave him alone...
 She seems unwell...
 We aren't getting through to her...
Paimon: Honestly though, Paimon's still wondering how this Mirror Maiden is here in the first place...
Paimon: Why don't we find a way to wake her up, (Traveler)? Then we can ask her what the Fatui scattered outside are up to?
 We can't just leave her in this state...
Paimon: Yeah... That Fatuus might be a bit of a weirdo, but Paimon doesn't think it's a good idea to leave her alone.
Paimon: But how in the world did she end up like this...
 It must've been that machine's fault...
Paimon: Oh right, the machine affected everyone on the island... But it has been shut down...
Mirror Maiden: The photo of myself and my brothers... I can't go back if I can't find it. But he's still there, waiting for me, all alone...

Zakhar: Is that true? Are you selling us out, Agafya!?
Agafya: It's alright, Zakhar. We'll just palm them off with something like "we Fatui are hunting mysterious Medaka in these waters"... or whatnot.
Paimon: What? Are you seriously talking openly about deceiving us? You're really underestimating us, huh?
Paimon: Well, the thorns have been cleared out, and Zakhar is safe and sound. It's time to pay up.
Zakhar: Don't tell them anything, Agafya！
Agafya: *sigh* At this point... To be honest, though, we really don't know much. We were just here to conduct some tests.
 Tests?
 What tests?
Agafya: Some sort of signal tests I guess... I don't know the details, but the other group from our squad should know.
Paimon: They did tell us a whole bunch of stuff, yeah. But is this all you got?
Agafya: That's all I know for sure... Now then, you have our intel, so can you let us go now?
Paimon: We didn't promise that, but you don't seem like you want to cause any trouble...
 Consider this a mercy then.
Agafya: Well, you have our thanks. I don't know what happened to the guys in the other group. We planned to get back to the camp in the center of the sea once we'd completed our mission.
Paimon: "Other group"? Oh, wait, you're talking about...
 She's talking about the Fatui we met earlier...
Agafya: You've met them? Zakhar, we have to return to camp and reach the rendezvous point as soon as possible...

Zakhar: What? You sold us out, Agafya?
Agafya: It's alright, Zakhar. We'll just palm them off with something like "we Fatui are hunting mysterious Medaka in these waters"... or whatnot.
Paimon: What? Are you seriously talking openly about deceiving us? You're really underestimating us, huh?
Paimon: Well, the thorns have been cleared out, and Zakhar is safe and sound. It's time to pay up.
Zakhar: Don't tell them anything, Agafya!
Agafya: *sigh* At this point... To be honest, though, we really don't know much. We were just here to conduct some tests.
 Tests?
 What tests?
Agafya: Some sort of signal tests I guess... I don't know the details, but the other group from our squad should know.
Paimon: That's all you got?
Agafya: That's all I know for sure... Now then, you have our intel, so can you let us go now?
Paimon: We didn't promise that, but you don't seem like you want to cause any trouble...
 Consider this a mercy then.
Agafya: Well, you have our thanks. Don't know what happened to the guys in the other group, though. We planned to get back to the camp in the middle of the ocean once our mission was completed.
Paimon: The guys in the other group?
Agafya: Yes, the other group of two. They said they were heading to the two islands in the south. And that's some extra intel for you, free of charge. You didn't trick us into that, you hear?
Paimon: A large island to the south... That has to be Minacious Isle.
Agafya: Alright, let's cut the chatter. We need to hurry back to our base camp...
 "Flying companion."
 (Let's leave her alone for now...)
 (Looks like we still can't talk to her...)
 (No response...)
 (This is strange...)
 (We aren't getting through to her...)
 About Zakhar...
Agafya: Zakhar is an orphan. His parents died of illness long ago, and it is said that he led a difficult life for a long time. He then heard that the Fatui provided free meals, and decided to join them...
 About the photo inside the pocket watch...
Agafya: That has nothing to do with the Fatui, and there's nothing there that you'd find interesting, either. I'm grateful that you helped me find the pocket watch, but I can't tell you about it...
 About the photo...
Agafya: Well, that's my two brothers in the photo, both of whom have devoted their services to Snezhnaya. I've always been proud of them.
 About the signal testing...
Agafya: Like I told you, I don't know much about it... They were probably just some simple tests, but running all over these islands was just... incredibly tiring.
 Consider this a mercy then.
 Correction, *you* almost did.
 Don't be so gullible, Paimon.
 Good idea. We should try that next time.
Paimon: Hey! We shouldn't be learning from them!
 Hey!
 It must've been that machine's fault...
 Quest DescriptionYou meet a Fatui Mirror Maiden on Broken Isle who keeps going on about losing a photo. It seems that you won't be able to communicate with her normally... But if you find some way to bring her back to her senses, perhaps you might be able to figure out why she is here.
 See you...
 She seems unwell...
 She was just provoking you.
 She's talking about the Fatui we met earlier...
 Show her the pocket watch.
 Tests?
 That would've been inhumane.
Mirror Maiden: ...Indeed. And that's what they taught us after we joined the Fatui.
 That's right!
 The Fatuus we met earlier...
 We aren't getting through to her...
 We can't just leave her in this state...
 What exactly are you up to here?
Agafya: We're just running errands here. That's all I can tell you.
 What tests?
 Who's Zakhar?
Agafya: Zakhar is my teammate. He's not feeling well...
Agafya: I wonder if something happened to him...
 Yeah, that does seem kinda inhumane.
(Approach the Electrohammer Vanguard)
Paimon: Look, there's a Fatui member over there. They look a little odd...
Paimon: That might be a squadmate Agafya mentioned. Let's go over and have a look, shall we?
(Talk to Agafya at the base camp) (Optional)
Agafya: What is it? Is there anything else? I've already told you everything I know...
 About the signal testing...
Agafya: Like I told you, I don't know much about it... They were probably just some simple tests, but running all over these islands was just... incredibly tiring.
 About Zakhar...
Agafya: Zakhar is an orphan. His parents died of illness long ago, and it is said that he led a difficult life for a long time. He then heard that the Fatui provided free meals, and decided to join them...
 About the photo...
Agafya: Well, that's my two brothers in the photo, both of whom have devoted their services to Snezhnaya. I've always been proud of them.
 See you...
(Talk to Zakhar at the base camp) (Optional)
Zakhar: We are enemies, you know? We really shouldn't be chatting this much.
Zakhar: If you talk to the enemy too much, you will become close and your heart softens, which puts you at a disadvantage in battle...
Zakhar: That's what our instructor told us.
Agafya walks into the cavern that was originally sealed by thorns...
Agafya: *sigh* At this point... To be honest, though, we really don't know much. We were just here to conduct some tests.
Agafya: ...*sigh* It's good to see that you're alright.
Agafya: Ah, Zakhar... I hope you're safe and sound... What is it? You haven't cleared the thorns yet?
Agafya: Alright, let's cut the chatter. We need to hurry back to our base camp...
Agafya: I wonder if something happened to him...
Agafya: If I do tell you something important, you could make a scary face, say something like "you've outlived your usefulness," and then take me out...
Agafya: Is it? I think that's pretty normal. Anyway, I'm here, all alone, and you can take me out pretty easily. I can't get away.
Agafya: It's alright, Zakhar. We'll just palm them off with something like "we Fatui are hunting mysterious Medaka in these waters"... or whatnot.
Agafya: Like I told you, I don't know much about it... They were probably just some simple tests, but running all over these islands was just... incredibly tiring.
Agafya: Our instructor said that there are many such incidents every year, and so we are not to reveal any sensitive information.
Agafya: Seriously, you didn't? I picked them for you... Just eat them if you're hungry.
Agafya: Some sort of signal tests I guess... I don't know the details, but the other group from our squad should know.
Agafya: That has nothing to do with the Fatui, and there's nothing there that you'd find interesting, either. I'm grateful that you helped me find the pocket watch, but I can't tell you about it...
Agafya: That's all I know for sure... Now then, you have our intel, so can you let us go now?

Agafya: Yes, the other group of two. They said they were heading to the two islands in the south. And that's some extra intel for you, free of charge. You didn't trick us into that, you hear?
Agafya: Yes, they rescued you from the thorns. They are nice... enemy rescuers.
Agafya: You've met them? Zakhar, we have to return to camp and reach the rendezvous point as soon as possible...
Agafya: Zakhar is an orphan. His parents died of illness long ago, and it is said that he led a difficult life for a long time. He then heard that the Fatui provided free meals, and decided to join them...
Agafya: Zakhar is my teammate. He's not feeling well...
Agafya: Zakhar! Why are you spilling everything to these outsiders!?
Agafya: Zakhar! Zakhar! Are you alright?
Having seemingly remembered something, the Fatuus, now clear of mind, departs.
Hydrogunner Legionnaire: ...
Mirror Maiden: ...I have to get back... I have to get back... He's still there. But my brothers are gone, and their photo...
Mirror Maiden: ...Indeed. And that's what they taught us after we joined the Fatui.
Mirror Maiden: Ah, so you saw right through me. What a pity.
Mirror Maiden: Anyway, you want intel? Here's some intel. Agafya. My name's Agafya. That's all I can tell you for now.
Mirror Maiden: But are you seriously going to burn someone alive? Not even the cruelest Fatui Agent would do that.
Mirror Maiden: He's still there alone. I need to get to him!
Mirror Maiden: I see... But since I came to my senses, it means that Researcher Persikov's experiment has failed.
Mirror Maiden: I... We... ugh, we came to this island and... Right! Yes, Zakhar!
Mirror Maiden: It's so great to have it back. Where did I lose it? ... Agh! My head... hurts...
Mirror Maiden: No, I can't leave him behind... Mustn't leave him alone...
Mirror Maiden: No, wait! You're the blond young (man/woman) and (his/her) flying companion, whom we saw in that internal communique!
Mirror Maiden: Seriously? You can't be that good, can you? I don't believe it.
Mirror Maiden: Thank you, thank you so much...
Mirror Maiden: The logical thing to do would've been to take the enemy's valuable possessions. For example, you should have snatched my group photo from the pocket watch and used it to wring some intel out of me.
Mirror Maiden: The photo of my brothers... I can't go back if I lose it...
Mirror Maiden: The photo of myself and my brothers... I can't go back if I can't find it. But he's still there, waiting for me, all alone...
Mirror Maiden: This... Ah, this is mine. There's a photo of me and my brothers inside...
Mirror Maiden: To be fair, I've heard that the two of you are extremely dangerous and that we might be attacked even while en route to work.
Mirror Maiden: We may be on opposing sides... But there must still be limits to one's conduct, surely!?
Mirror Maiden: What happened here? There was a cave here when we first arrived. And what's with the thorns...
Mirror Maiden: What have you done to me? My...There's a gap in my memories. You didn't perform some weird experiment on me, did you!?
Mirror Maiden: Whoa, that's inhumane.
Mirror Maiden: You mean fire? You're not trying to set the thorns on fire, are you? Someone's still inside!
Mirror Maiden: You've probably guessed the reason for the failure... Well, but from where we stand, we're still enemies. Bringing that photo back to me... Has anyone told you that you're too nice to your foes?
Mirror Maiden: Zakhar! Zakhar! Can you hear me?
Paimon: "Other group"? Oh, wait, you're talking about...
Paimon: (Traveler), there's something fishy about the Mirror Maiden...
Paimon: A large island to the south... That has to be Minacious Isle.
Paimon: Another group... and the other Fatui working with them, huh?
Paimon: Another group... and the other Fatui working with them, huh?
Paimon: That is kinda concerning. According to her, we can find 'em near Minacious Isle, so let's start our search there...
Paimon: Are you agreeing with her? Whose side are you on!?
Paimon: Are you seriously lecturing us now...
Paimon: But how in the world did she end up like this...
Paimon: Eh, you can thank your Mirage experiments, or whatever that was.
Paimon: Grr, you sneaky Fatuus! We almost fell for your trick!
Paimon: Hey! We shouldn't be learning from them!
Paimon: Hey, Fatuus...
Paimon: Hey, who are you? What are you doing over here?
Paimon: Hey, you! Fatui person over there!
Paimon: Hmm... Honestly, this really doesn't feel like a fair trade. Still, (Traveler), let's clear the thorns away first.
Paimon: Honestly though, Paimon's still wondering how this Mirror Maiden is here in the first place...
Paimon: Huh, that's odd. We've got four apples over here on the ground...
Paimon: Huh? A lone mission? What for, Paimon wonders...
Paimon: Huh? You did that on purpose!
Paimon: It's "Paimon"! How hard is it to remember one name?
Paimon: Just a name!?
Paimon: Look, there's a Fatui member over there. They look a little odd...
Paimon: Now, pardon me, but I think we've seen this scene before...
Paimon: Of course not. Anyway, burning these thorns with fire won't do us any good...
Paimon: Oh right, the machine affected everyone on the island... But it has been shut down...
Paimon: Paimon gets it now... (Traveler), let's find that photo that's so dear to her. Maybe that'll help her recover her wits!
Paimon: Right. When we met Chevka earlier, he was muttering about some "insignia" thing, and he came to his senses after we gave the insignia to him.
Paimon: Should we try to find something and get her to regain her senses?
Paimon: So... This Mirror Maiden could be a member of Chevka's squad, right?
Paimon: Speaking of which, we picked up a pocket watch with a group photo inside it on the island. Could the photo be the one?
Paimon: That is kinda concerning. According to her, we can find 'em near Minacious Isle, so let's start our search there...
Paimon: That might be a squadmate Agafya mentioned. Let's go over and have a look, shall we?
Paimon: That's "Paimon" to you! But you know what? We might as well change Paimon's name to "flying companion" if this keeps happening...
Paimon: That's a good question...
Paimon: That's all you got?
Paimon: That's how you wring intel out of the enemy, right? By threatening something precious to them?
Paimon: That's right! What are you guys up to here, huh? Spill the beans!
Paimon: The Fatui are doing experiments here that even affect their own people. Well, Paimon calls this "getting a taste of their own medicine"!
Paimon: The guys in the other group?
Paimon: There are similar thorns all over the island, but with the help of a certain method...
Paimon: They did tell us a whole bunch of stuff, yeah. But is this all you got?
Paimon: They're not up to something again, are they?
Paimon: Ugh... So, uh, anyway, here's the deal. We'll save the person in there, but in return, you'll have to give us some intel.
Paimon: We didn't promise that, but you don't seem like you want to cause any trouble...
Paimon: We found it beside the hilichurl camp!
Paimon: We found the photo for you, you know? Is this how you're gonna pay us back?
Paimon: We have a way to clear the thorns without hurting people inside.
Paimon: We wouldn't do that! And that's a very weird thing for your instructor to say...
Paimon: Well, she did promise that if we got you out, she'd tell us exactly what you're plotting here.
Paimon: Well, the thorns have been cleared out, and Zakhar is safe and sound. It's time to pay up.
Paimon: What the... They ran off so quickly! C'mon (Traveler), we gotta catch up to them!
Paimon: What? Are you seriously talking openly about deceiving us? You're really underestimating us, huh?
Paimon: What? Bah! C'mon, (Traveler), let's show her how the pros do it!
Paimon: Why are the Fatui here? This Mirror Maiden...
Paimon: Why don't we find a way to wake her up, (Traveler)? Then we can ask her what the Fatui scattered outside are up to?
Paimon: Yeah... That Fatuus might be a bit of a weirdo, but Paimon doesn't think it's a good idea to leave her alone.
Paimon: You bet we did!
Paimon: You guys are the ones doing the strange experiments here!
The Fatuus' clarity returns upon obtaining the pocket watch...
Zakhar: Agafya, did you bring them here?
Zakhar: Agafya... What's going on? I was just sleeping. I feel all better now.
Zakhar: But aren't we your enemies? Why help us?
Zakhar: But things were much harder on you, weren't they? You took on the mission alone, after all. So even though I was very hungry, I held myself back!
Zakhar: Don't tell them anything, Agafya!
Zakhar: Don't tell them anything, Agafya！
Zakhar: Hehe, I can be kind of scatter-brained like that. The name's Zakhar. Wait, you and us... We're enemies!
Zakhar: Hehe... Oh, Agafya, about the four fruits you gave me earlier, I didn't eat them. I was saving them for you.
Zakhar: If you talk to the enemy too much, you will become close and your heart softens, which puts you at a disadvantage in battle...
Zakhar: Is that true? Are you selling us out, Agafya!?
Zakhar: That's right. Soon after you left, huge thorns suddenly sprouted and sealed the cave. Wait, you were the ones who got rid of those giant thorns? Amazing!
Zakhar: That's what our instructor told us.
Zakhar: Uh, what? Oh, wait. You're the one on the internal communique. (Traveler) and...
Zakhar: We are enemies, you know? We really shouldn't be chatting this much.
Zakhar: Well, Yakov nearly broke the device, so...
Zakhar: What? You sold us out, Agafya?
Zakhar: Yes, this is the "flying companion"!
