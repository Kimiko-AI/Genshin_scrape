 Eula?
 Hey, don't think like that.
 Hmm, maybe.
 I'm here if you want to talk.
 Is something troubling you?
 Others will accept you, Eula...
 Quest Description"Tsk, why is a Lawrence drinking here too... What bad luck...""Ahem... Better watch your mouth. She is one of the Knights, after all..."
 There will be many people who accept you one day, Eula...
 We're learning to become bartenders...
 What's the matter?
 Winds always change their course.
 Would you like me to walk you back?
 Yes, just be patient.
 You only just now noticed us?
Another familiar face has arrived at the tavern.
Following Paimon's instructions, you mix water into the coffee...
Media:Vo eqtj002 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh, this doesn't look like the drink they ordered. Just give this one to Paimon and try making another.
Media:vo eqtj006 1 eula 01.ogg Eula: A small Foamy Reef, please... Thank you.
Media:vo eqtj006 1 eula 02.ogg Eula: I... I'm fine.
Media:vo eqtj006 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh... There's something off about Eula. Was she already drinking before she got here?
Media:vo eqtj006 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: But, Foamy Reef has coffee in it. Would it upset her stomach if she has coffee after liquor?
Media:vo eqtj006 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: For her tummy's sake, let's water it down before serving it to her!
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 01.ogg Eula: This tastes pretty good...
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 02.ogg Eula: One more, bartender... Huh? Wâ€”Wait, it's you guys?
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 03.ogg Eula: Ugh...
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 04.ogg Eula: Sorry. I just came here from The Cat's Tail. Perhaps I had a little too much to drink...
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 05.ogg Eula: ...
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 06.ogg Eula: I suppose I always do drink alone.
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 07.ogg Eula: As long as I'm in Mondstadt, I'll never be welcome at taverns. I was actually feeling good today and wanted a drink, but they still wouldn't get off my back...
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 08.ogg Eula: Tell me, (Traveler), how did you manage to make so many friends?
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 09.ogg Eula: People always sound so appreciative and are always smiling when they talk about you.
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 10.ogg Eula: But as for me, just mentioning my family name is enough to make everyone...
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 11.ogg Eula: Hey, who said I was pretending.
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 12.ogg Eula: Do you think so? Heh, it's impossible to imagine, even when I'm this drunk...
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 13.ogg Eula: Even after being a Knight of Favonius for all this time, people still... whatever.
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 14.ogg Eula: Okay, thank you...
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 15.ogg Eula: I... ahem! I should go now.
Media:vo eqtj006 2 eula 16.ogg Eula: No need. I want to remember what you said, and I won't be able to think about anything else until I write everything down.
Media:vo eqtj006 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow, she didn't even notice how much water we added. She must've had a lot to drink.
Media:vo eqtj006 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yeah. It's pretty lonely to drink by yourself. You'll feel better if you talk to us!
Media:vo eqtj006 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You didn't choose to be born into the Lawrence clan, and we don't care about that kind of thing. The Eula we know is a great person!
Media:vo eqtj006 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: But you don't like being straightforward. You always pretend to hold a grudge, and you try to hide your tenderness away from everyone...
Media:vo eqtj006 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh, right! Tone-Deaf Bard said something wise like that, too.
Media:vo eqtj006 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Just be yourself, Eula... and keep moving forward.
Media:vo eqtj006 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Sooner or later you'll change what people think about the Lawrence clan!
Media:vo eqtj006 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Eula sure is a lot more open after a few drinks.
Media:vo eqtj006 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: But it does feel like something's missing without her signature revenge line.
Media:vo eqtj006 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh... When she wakes up in the morning, do you think she'll come threatening us to forget about what happened today?
Traveler: (Alright, this drink is looking good.)
