 Quest DescriptionYou discover someone who is promoting Theater Mechanicus in Inazuma...
 What is it?
Komakata: W—Welcome! I am a local representative for this new game from Liyue. It's called Theater Mechanicus!
Komakata: In short, it is a game that can be played on a board. It was first invented by Ms. Ruijin from Liyue.
Komakata: Well, according to Ms. Ruijin, I am one of their overseas agents.
 Why did the Outlander Affairs Agency confiscate this...
Komakata: After I obtained... umm... the distribution rights, Ms. Ruijin sent me a complete set of Theater Mechanicus and the business model that goes with it.
Komakata: Ah, I see. You must've played it in Liyue before.
Komakata: Although it initially got confiscated by the Outlander Affairs Agency... it took me a while to get a copy of this game back.
Komakata: And per Ms. Ruijin's suggestions, I added new features to Theater Mechanicus.
Komakata: Anyway, let's not talk about this.
Komakata: Come, try your hand at Theater Mechanicus!
Komakata: Do you see these things laid out on the table here? These are all important items used in Theater Mechanicus.
Komakata: Does it feel like Liyue? Hahaha, this version was tailor-made according to the descriptions in Ms. Ruijin's letter.
Komakata: I even had someone make this table... It cost me a fortune.
