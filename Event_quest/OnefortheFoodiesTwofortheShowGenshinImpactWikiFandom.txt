Chongyun – Frozen Ardor
The young thaumaturge Chongyun was born to a clan of exorcists. He travels the land, working to exorcise demons.
He is an honest and serious lad by nature, and is both hardworking and persevering, never shrinking from any sort of hardship.
However, he has one problem that no amount of work can solve, and that is the pure-yang spirit he was born with.
This pure-yang spirit is capable of repelling demons to point where Chongyun has never had to lift a finger to stop them. As a result, he has almost never seen a demon in his life.
This troubles Chongyun greatly, of course — because seriously, what exorcist has never encountered a demon to exorcise before?

Hu Tao – Fragrance in Thaw
Liyue's Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is a very old name in the funerary business, and its directorship is now up to its 77th generation, with the current Director being a young lady named Hu Tao.
This young director is known for her sharp intellect, but in some peoples' eyes, Hu Tao might be a little too smart for her own good.
Indeed, the quirky and eccentric Hu Tao is not what people expect from a solemn title like that of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's director.
However, Hu Tao has a unique outlook on life and death, and though she is surrounded by death every day, her optimistic outlook has never changed. Quite an odd duck, this one.

(If the player has not met Xingqiu yet, an introductory note appears on screen)
Xingqiu - Juvenile Galant
Born to the nobility, Xingqiu is the young master of Liyue Harbor's Feiyun Commerce Guild. He loves books and chivalrous deeds.
These "books" refer to the thrilling heroic tales of heroes and heroines out in the wilds — tales of mercy, romance, and vengeance. "Chivalry," on the other hand, refers to aiding the weak and going wherever one pleases.
However, Xingqiu is a genial soul despite having such passions, and treats everyone with civility.
When speaking to him, if one hears some odd and obscure line like "through war, harmony," it is quite likely to just be a quote from the latest martial arts novel he has been reading.
 ...Hmm?
 A certain person comes to mind...
 At the end there, she sounded like your big sister.
 Aww, Keqing...
 Can't help being popular.
 Could it be...
 Don't mention it.
 Ganyu?
 Hi, Madame Ping!
 Huh? Everyone's gathered together here...
 I think so.
 I'd like to hear what Xiangling thinks.
 I'd love to help, but...
 I'm in the middle of a commission for Xiangling...
 I'm in the middle of a commission for Xiangling...
 Important considerations for any chef.
 Is it a new invention?
 It's been a while.
 It's okay, Hu Tao, just keep it simple.
 Just grin and bear it.
 Just smile back once in a while.
 Keqing, can you spare the time?
 Let's agree to disagree.
 No immediate plans.
 No need to be so nervous, Yanxiao.
 Not a lot of overlap...
 Oh, so that's what it's called.
 Paimon can explain.
 Paimon has taste...?
 Quest DescriptionPaimon, ever-gluttonous, pulls you over to Wanmin Restaurant for a good meal. There, you happen to meet Xiangling, who is deep in thought. You accompany her to look for new inspiration in order to help her win the Masterful Chefs competition.
 She does have a formidable presence.
 So, what do you need us to do?
 Sorry to bother you...
 Sure, I can help.
 Thank you, Chef Mao.
 Thanks everyone.
 Thanks for agreeing to dig out that book.
 The Stove God is the friend, right?
 Uh... Is this a bad time?
 We certainly don't lack contacts.
 We're all friends here.
 We've come to hang out!
 When the heat is on, you'll rise to the challenge!
 Xiangling, can I ask you a question?
 Yep.
 You could put it like that, yeah...
 You seem to be getting along fine already.
 You're clearly a keen philosopher.
After a while, Smiley Yanxiao comes back with an ancient tome in his hands...
After having a delicious meal...
After some work, Smiley Yanxiao arrives with a multi-course meal...

Media:vo dialog eqzyj001 baizhu 01.ogg Baizhu: Food and medicine are inextricably intertwined, you know. To give a full account of all the ways in which they are connected, why, I'd have to start that story from a long, long way back...
Media:vo dialog eqzyj001 beidou 01.ogg Beidou: Ha. Well, everyone has their way of procrastinating, I guess.
Media:vo dialog eqzyj001 changsheng 01.ogg Changsheng: Shhhh! Nobody was asking!
Media:vo dialog eqzyj001 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: Huh? Um, that's why you brought me along?
Media:vo dialog eqzyj001 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: Xingqiu, don't you think you have one too many frivolous books in your collection...
Media:vo dialog eqzyj001 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: Ugh... Really, Xingqiu...
Media:vo dialog eqzyj001 hutao 01.ogg Hu Tao: If you find out anything interesting, you gotta come back and tell me about it!
Media:vo dialog eqzyj001 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: Hmm... Okay... Interesting...
Media:vo dialog eqzyj001 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Sincerely, Beidou, you misunderstand me. I have many simple pleasures — I take a stroll through Yujing Terrace and one down by the harbor every single day.
Media:vo dialog eqzyj001 qiqi 01.ogg Qiqi: Coconut milk... Now I want coconut milk.
Media:vo dialog eqzyj001 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: Whew... This book is pretty complicated...
Media:vo dialog eqzyj001 xingqiu 01.ogg Xingqiu: Now, which book to read today? Aha, how about this — Chongyun, pick a book, any book, and read it out loud to me, will you? That way, I can give my mind a rest.
Media:vo dialog eqzyj001 xingqiu 02.ogg Xingqiu: Don't like that plan? Okay, then I'll read one for you. Hmm... how about "Young and Hopelessly Smitten"?
Media:vo dialog eqzyj001 xingqiu 03.ogg Xingqiu: Okay... "A Guide to Getting Ahead in Yujing Terrace." How about this one, then?
Media:vo dialog eqzyj001 yanxiao 01.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Alright, show me how it's done!
Media:vo eqzyj001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: You know, this is starting to feel like chili pepper weather. Mmm, Paimon's hungry for some fresh and fiery spicy food that let your taste buds have a blast!
Media:vo eqzyj001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: And if there's one dish that fits the bill, it's Black-Back Perch Stew! C'mon, (Traveler), let's pay a visit to Wanmin Restaurant!
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: Hi.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 keqing 02.ogg Keqing: Let me fill you in...
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 keqing 03.ogg Keqing: Legends claim that the Stove God once appeared at the Guili Assembly. As Wangshu Inn is the oldest extant building in this area, any historical texts from around these parts are likely to have ended up here.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 keqing 04.ogg Keqing: Is there a room in this inn for storing books? And if there is, do any of them mention the Stove God?
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 keqing 05.ogg Keqing: Sorry for the trouble, Traveler.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 keqing 06.ogg Keqing: Okay.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 keqing 07.ogg Keqing: Thank you ever so much.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Friends of ours. Allow Paimon to introduce Xiangling, Guoba, and Keqing.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What is it? We need to pay up or something?
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: A Satisfying Salad? What for?
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Shh! Don't you think he can hear you!?
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh, so this is for Xiao! You guys really look after him, huh.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Clock is ticking! 59, 58...
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: While Keqing's reading her book, let's make that Satisfying Salad! Xiangling, what are you gonna do?
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Okay. Shall we go, then?
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: (Look at that strong body, those powerful hands, and honest eyes... this guy must be a really great chef!)
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 xiangling 02.ogg Xiangling: I'd love to come watch too, but I don't wanna get in the way. So I'll just stay here with Keqing.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 01.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Huh? Oh, Traveler. Who are all these people?
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 02.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Keqing? Of the Qixing!? She's the, um... the, uh...
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 03.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: It's not that, it's... I mean, I'm just your typical commoner, I've never met someone as high up as the Yuheng before in my whole life!
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 04.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: So, is there something I can help you with? You've come a long way out to end up at Wangshu Inn.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 05.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Okay, I see.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 06.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Now that you mention it, we do have a fair few ancient texts here. I remember looking through an old recipe book once... I just need to remember where they're all stored.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 07.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: If you're happy to wait here for a few minutes, I'll go have a look right away!
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 08.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Oh, Traveler, there's something I need to discuss with you.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 09.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: What? No, I wouldn't take your money! We're all friends here. I just wanted to ask if you had the time to make a Satisfying Salad for me?
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 10.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Guy who hangs out on the roof terrace, you know? Good looking fella, not too tall...
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 11.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Oh, right! Uh, yeah, maybe. Anyway, you know who I mean.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 12.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: The boss told me to take care of him, but this guy, let me tell you — he is one tough nut to crack. He usually turns his nose up at everything that isn't Almond Tofu.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 13.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: But the boss tells me you once made him a Satisfying Salad and it all went down so well. So I was thinking... Could you teach me how to make it too? That way, I'll have something else in my arsenal.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 14.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Well, that's life, right? You've gotta look out for your own people.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 15.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Alright then — wait right here, I'll be just one minute!
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 16.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Here you are.
Media:vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 17.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Go ahead and get started, I'll just watch from over here! I only need to watch you make it once to have it committed to memory.
Media:vo eqzyj001 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: That should do it!
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: You've finished cooking? Good timing, we've finished our reading, too.
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 02.ogg Keqing: Useful. There is a passage concerning the Stove God, and it's not what we were expecting.
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 03.ogg Keqing: I quote: "60 miles to the northwest is the Guili Assembly. Many were settled there, where they hunted in groups, farmed the land, and made their living from what the soil yielded."
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 04.ogg Keqing: "When the Stove God descended, one god became many, all of which were the height of children. As does a star when it descends into the world, so the Stove God went out among the common folk and taught them to create fire. With fire, the people at last learned to make hot food, and they dined on rice congee and cooked meat thereafter."
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 05.ogg Keqing: This is a radically different account from the one given in "Demystifying the Legends of Liyue," and also a conflicting one.
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 06.ogg Keqing: Taking the text at face value, that is what it says.
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 07.ogg Keqing: By continuing with our investigation, and reserving judgment for now.
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 08.ogg Keqing: Thank you for this text, Yanxiao.
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 09.ogg Keqing: It's hard to refuse a generous offer like that... Yes, I think we can fit this in.
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 10.ogg Keqing: Yanxiao, we await your culinary creations with great anticipation.
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: You got all the steps down, right?
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's go see what Keqing and Xiangling are up to.
(Traveler, Paimon, and Smiley Yanxiao approach Keqing and Xiangling)
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Keqing, Xiangling, we're back!
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: "One god became many"... Does that mean there was more than one Stove God?
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So we've got two leads, but they contradict each other. How do we know which one to believe?
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: "Went out among the common folk and taught them to create fire"... So, did the Stove God really go and teach people how to cook firsthand?
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 xiangling 02.ogg Xiangling: Wow, he sure sounds confident in his cooking! I like that — confidence is one of the best ingredients a chef can have!
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 xiangling 03.ogg Xiangling: I really wanna try his cooking. I say we take him up on his offer!
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 yanxiao 01.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Alright, thanks for that. I think I've got it now.
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 yanxiao 02.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Of course. Don't forget, I am the best chef around these parts.
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 yanxiao 03.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: And? Useful, or no?
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 yanxiao 04.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Now that's a god who truly cared for their people.
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 yanxiao 05.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: It's my pleasure, really. Think nothing of it. If anything, I should be thanking the Traveler.
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 yanxiao 06.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Listen, you've helped me an awful lot — not just today but in the past, too. I wanna make it up to you properly, and as it happens, things are pretty quiet here today. So I'd like to take the chance to treat you all. What do you say — will you stay for a meal?
Media:vo eqzyj001 12 yanxiao 07.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Haha, I won't disappoint!
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 gooba 01.ogg Guoba: ♪~♪
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 gooba 02.ogg Guoba: ♪~
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 gooba 03.ogg Guoba: ?
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: You'd think you own the place.
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 02.ogg Keqing: Strange, I never would have guessed that such a gifted chef worked here. This inn isn't particularly known for its food.
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 03.ogg Keqing: No, it seemed more sportsmanlike than that.
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 04.ogg Keqing: Oh! Guoba's eating the...
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 05.ogg Keqing: Ohh... my Golden Shrimp Balls...
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 06.ogg Keqing: I have to say, now that you mention it, that is a very accurate appraisal of the situation...
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 07.ogg Keqing: Hmm...
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 08.ogg Keqing: (I don't have high hopes for this, but equally I don't want her feeling guilty... Okay, I'll let her do this for me.)
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 09.ogg Keqing: If you insist, there is one dish that perhaps you could try making for me. It's an old recipe from my grandfather's notes.
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 10.ogg Keqing: I'll get it to you when we're back in Liyue Harbor.
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 11.ogg Keqing: Traveler, have you finished eating?
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 12.ogg Keqing: Before we do anything else, let's head back to Liyue Harbor. I need to fetch something.
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Everybody, please be seated!
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Mmmm~! It smells beauuuutiful!
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: What was that? Some kind of power move?
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 paimon 04.ogg Paimon:[Note 1] Bad!
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: What's the big deal? We can just get another plate. After all, it's Yanxiao's treat today.
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: I'll sit here, with Guoba!
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 02.ogg Xiangling: (!!!)
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 03.ogg Xiangling: (It all smells amazing... I think I've met my fellow finalist!)
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 04.ogg Xiangling: Yanxiao... are you taking part in this year's Masterful Chefs?
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 05.ogg Xiangling: Yep, I've signed up already, and I've got my eyes on the prize! Your cooking's delicious, Yanxiao. I'm really looking forward to seeing you in the final!
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 06.ogg Xiangling: Yep! He's a really talented chef. His food was excellent, and it showed he has a level-headed personality. That's the kind of chef that could be a match for me.
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 07.ogg Xiangling: I haven't had any competitive cooking experience since my cook-off with Brook in Springvale.
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 08.ogg Xiangling: You're too kind... Ah!!! Guoba, what are you doing!?
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 09.ogg Xiangling: Those were Keqing's! How could you steal them while she wasn't looking!?
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 10.ogg Xiangling: You ate every last one... *sigh* Guoba, we've been through this. When we're with friends, you gotta be on your best behavior, okay?
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 11.ogg Xiangling: I'm so sorry, Keqing, I promise I'll make it up to you!
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 12.ogg Xiangling: It's not the same, though! The moment's gone. Sure, you can eat something else, but you can never go back and change that feeling of despair as your food is snatched away from right under your nose...
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 13.ogg Xiangling: The dining experience is a trinity of emotion, food, and atmosphere, and you've gotta have all three to make it work!
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 14.ogg Xiangling: I'm gonna make it up to you, Keqing. Is there anything you wanna eat? Anything at all! Whatever it is, I'll make it for you!
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 15.ogg Xiangling: No problem. May I see it?
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 yanxiao 01.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Here we are. That's everything you ordered.
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 yanxiao 02.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Everyone likes a good meal, whether they're staying the night or just stopping by for a bite. We call it an inn, but the fact is, it's much more than that. We have to cater to all aspects of daily life to make this a true home away from home.
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 yanxiao 03.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Please enjoy your meal at your leisure. I should get back to work now.
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 yanxiao 04.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: ...!
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 yanxiao 05.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Y—You too...?
Media:vo eqzyj001 13 yanxiao 06.ogg Smiley Yanxiao: Hah... interesting. Alright, I'll see you there!
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: I need to go home to fetch my grandfather's notes. Let's meet at Wanmin Restaurant later.
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 02a.ogg Media:vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 02b.ogg Keqing: I actually have something to discuss with (him/her). You go ahead, we'll join you later.
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 03.ogg Keqing: Traveler, come here for a moment.
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 04.ogg Keqing: I need your advice on something... What do I need to do to get along with Xiangling?
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 05.ogg Keqing: What's so strange about it? Why are you looking at me like that...?
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 06.ogg Keqing: Well that's just ridiculous...
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 07.ogg Keqing: Xiangling's always so warm and friendly with me, this time especially, and now she's desperate to do me a favor... So is that supposed to mean... uh, we're friends already?
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 08.ogg Keqing: I'm just not used to dealing with people who are so warm right from the get-go. How exactly am I supposed to respond to that?
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 09.ogg Keqing: Oh... um, okay...
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 10.ogg Keqing: Ahem! Noted. Thank you, Traveler, I'll see you again shortly.
(Keqing leaves)
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Great!
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: ...Seriously? That's what's stressing you out?
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You're super smart and you're always so sure of yourself. Paimon thought you'd never need advice from anyone about anything.
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: What's making Keqing so self-conscious? Paimon thought nobody would be able to get under her skin.
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: I'll go get everything ready! Traveler, what about you? Are you gonna do your own thing for a while, or do you wanna come in and have a seat?
Media:vo eqzyj001 14 xiangling 02.ogg Xiangling: Okay, gotcha.
(Xiangling leaves)
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 01.ogg Cloud Retainer: Excuse me! One shall not be addressed in such a manner!
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 02.ogg Cloud Retainer: One shall be known as an adeptus, whose name, should you care to mention it, is Cloud Retainer.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 03.ogg Cloud Retainer: Well spoken. One shall let this young lady's enlightened words atone for the ignorant ones of her friend.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 04.ogg Cloud Retainer: A while it has indeed been, Traveler. Does one surmise correctly that you hasten hither to partake in the Moonchase Festival?
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 05.ogg Cloud Retainer: Ah so, even the illustrious Traveler has been summoned to attend the Moonchase Festival. As expected, this year's theme stands proud against the test of public scrutiny.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 06.ogg Cloud Retainer: The very same. Moonchase Festival falls during the season when many cooking ingredients are ripe, hence it is a fitting time to enjoy the finest of foods. One noticed the relative pomp and ceremony with which this year's affairs are being conducted, and could not abide to stand idly by.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 07.ogg Cloud Retainer: Let it be known that one's culinary proficiency and ingenuity is uncontested in all the world! Thus does one now appear in this realm, that those who inhabit it might witness one's latest creation: a supreme cuisine machine.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 08.ogg Cloud Retainer: Patience! One's purpose here today is to meet and to greet, nothing further. All shall be revealed before your very eyes when the time arrives.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 09.ogg Cloud Retainer: Traveler. You are one who has witnessed much of the culinary world. When the day comes, one would be most pleased to see you in attendance, offering your most vociferous ovations.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 10.ogg Cloud Retainer: Hmph. That which is implicitly understood needs not be made explicit, let alone official.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 11.ogg Cloud Retainer: I shall say no more, and dwell here no longer. Await my word! Be there or beware!
(Cloud Retainer takes off and leaves)
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 keqing 01.ogg ???: What are you all huddled together over here for? The adeptus left already.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 keqing 02.ogg Keqing: Sorry I kept you waiting. Xiangling, this is the recipe from my grandfather's notes. They're not in the best condition, so rather than bring them out of the house, I just transcribed the recipe.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 keqing 03.ogg Keqing: Unfortunately, the texts my grandfather worked with were very old — usually faded, damaged, or both. Some parts are missing from this recipe, too. Do you think you'll still be able to work with it?
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 keqing 04.ogg Keqing: Sorry for the trouble.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey Xiangling, we're here!
(Guoba waves twice at the Traveler and Paimon)
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh... we're gonna do this now?
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: But this was your idea! Why you gotta dump it on Paimon!? Urgh...
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Okay, so, back at Wangshu Inn, we noticed you and Keqing were getting along pretty well. So you really like hanging out with her, huh?
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: You're a braver person than Paimon... The first time we met Keqing, Paimon found her pretty intimidating...
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Yeah, she's great, we know that now! We're just talking about first impressions.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: We've eaten shellfish before, but... nope, don't think we've tried eating them grilled.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: You make a good point.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: You know, (Traveler), Xiangling's intuition for people seems really spot-on. Is that why she took a liking to Keqing so quickly?
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Huh? What was that noise!?
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Ah, it's the lady bird!
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: What's a... supreme cuisine machine?
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Ooh, so we're officially invited?
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: This bird always disappears just as quickly as she shows up. Wait, not bird — adeptus! ...Hey, wait, isn't she technically an illuminated bird, though...?
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: She definitely, definitely loves her food.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Yay, Keqing's back!
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: Hey, grab a seat. I'm just running through my ingredients to see what I'm missing.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 02.ogg Xiangling: What is it?
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 03.ogg Xiangling: Yep! Keqing's good-natured and easy to be around. The kind of person everyone wants to know, right?
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 04.ogg Xiangling: You think so? I remember thinking straight away that she was really easy to get along with. Didn't you see her sneaking treats to Guoba back at Wangshu Inn?
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 05.ogg Xiangling: First impressions? Oh, okay — Hey, have you guys eaten grilled shellfish before? They can be hard to crack at first. But they taste amazing that way.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 06.ogg Xiangling: Oh, you're missing out! I'll grill some for you another time. But anyway, Keqing's like a shellfish. Maybe a little closed-off at first, but once you get to know her, she's got a soft and squishy side, too!
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 07.ogg Xiangling: Not to mention that even after her favorite food was stolen away, she was still happy looking after Guoba. I'm really grateful for that.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 08.ogg Xiangling: Alright, let's see... We're okay for Carrots and Crab, and we still got some Ham and Mushrooms... Hmm, I wonder what Keqing's recipe is gonna be?
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 09.ogg Xiangling: What's going on?
(Xiangling, Traveler, and Paimon run out of Wanmin Restaurant)
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 10.ogg Xiangling: What the! That bird is huge!
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 11.ogg Xiangling: Cloud Retainer... that does sound like an adeptus name.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 12.ogg Xiangling: The theme? You mean "Feast of the Bounteous Land"?
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 13.ogg Xiangling: A... a supreme cuisine what?
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 14.ogg Xiangling: She seemed like someone very prestigious, and very talented at cooking.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 15.ogg Xiangling: Oh, okay! Lemme take a look... Hmm... Mm-hmm... Mm, mm.
Media:vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 16.ogg Xiangling: Gimme some time, I need to look into it!
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 01.ogg ???: Oh, uh... you're all here...?
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 02.ogg Ganyu: Sorry to interrupt your conversation... I was in the area buying a few things and I heard the disturbance, so I felt compelled to come take a look...
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 03.ogg Ganyu: Lady Keqing, you saw her too? ...Ahh!!!
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 04.ogg Ganyu: Do you, uh, have a moment? I need to... discuss something with you.
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 05.ogg Ganyu: No, it's nothing work-related. I wanted to ask about... um, something personal. Is that okay?
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 06.ogg Ganyu: Please, Lady Keqing? This is really important to me...
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 07.ogg Ganyu: I noticed Cloud Retainer was here for quite a while. Did she say anything about... m—me? When I was young?
(Keqing shakes her head)
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 08.ogg Ganyu: What? Really!? Phew!!! Thank goodness...
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 09.ogg Ganyu: I was getting really worried... Once she gets talking to people, she tends to go off on all sorts of tangents... so I was worried she might have bored you with some stories about me, heh...
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 10.ogg Ganyu: Ah! P—Please, no, don't do that to me...
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 11.ogg Ganyu: ...Keqing, I...
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 12.ogg Ganyu: Thank you. You're so kind and considerate... I've always seen that in you.
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 13.ogg Ganyu: Oh my, you're right, I should. Okay everyone, please excuse me, I should get back to work now. Take good care of Keqing for me.
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 14.ogg Ganyu: Thanks. Hope to see you again soon.
(Ganyu leaves)
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: You mean Cloud Retainer? I saw her too. She just suddenly showed up right in the middle of the street... Whatever adeptal power that was, she certainly knows how to make an entrance.
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 02.ogg Keqing: What is it, Ganyu? Has something urgent come up while I've been out?
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 03.ogg Keqing: (A personal matter... involving me? Surely I haven't done anything improper recently, have I?)
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 04.ogg Keqing: Oh, uh, okay.
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 05.ogg Keqing: About your childhood? No, nothing at all.
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 06.ogg Keqing: Your name didn't even come up. So you've nothing to worry about.
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 07.ogg Keqing: Of course not. Whatever it is, I'm not curious, and I'm not going to ask.
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 08.ogg Keqing: If Ganyu has a secret and she wishes to keep it that way, nobody should make it their business to try and get it out of her. That's just basic decency, is it not?
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 09.ogg Keqing: Wh—What's that got to do with... Honestly. Go on, you should be getting back now.
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 10.ogg Keqing: Hey! What are you trying to say!?
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 11.ogg Keqing: Ehh... just ignore her.
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 12.ogg Keqing: I don't want to assert either way... but it seems highly likely.
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 13.ogg Keqing: Master? You mean, your teacher is an adeptus?
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: That voice sounds familiar...
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Keqing, how are you not asking a bunch of questions right now? There's obviously some juicy gossip here, aren't you curious to find out what it is?
(Traveler nods in agreement)
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Y—Yes, Ma'am... Paimon'll never bring it up again...
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Aw, don't worry, Ganyu, we will!
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Ooh! Could be!
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: Hey everyone! I just had an idea!
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 xiangling 02.ogg Xiangling: It only occurred to me when that adeptus showed up. Do you think the Stove God could be an adeptus too?
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 xiangling 03.ogg Xiangling: In that case, we should go ask the adepti about it. I think my master might be able to help.
Media:vo eqzyj001 16 xiangling 04.ogg Xiangling: Uh-huh, she's over at Yujing Terrace. C'mon, I'll introduce you!
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 gooba 01.ogg Guoba: ♪
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: I did not expect that...
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 02.ogg Keqing: Hello.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 03.ogg Keqing: Does this mean... you know them personally?
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 04.ogg Keqing: That's right, we're investigating something that happened recently.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 05.ogg Keqing: Rex Lapis... *sigh*
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 06.ogg Keqing: In the hands of Rex Lapis, our nation's traditions were faithfully upheld... It is to their detriment that we must now be the ones to inherit this duty.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 07.ogg Keqing: ...Thank you.
(Xiangsheng appears)
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 08.ogg Keqing: Hmm?
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 09.ogg Keqing: Ningguang's looking for me?
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 10.ogg Keqing: Must be important... Please excuse me, everyone. If I'm not back soon, you'll find me at Ningguang's office.
(Keqing leaves)
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 01.ogg Madame Ping: Hehe, hello Xiangling.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 02.ogg Madame Ping: Very well, thank you. What a surprise it is that you all had the time to come and visit me today.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 03.ogg Madame Ping: Of course I know the Stove God.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 04.ogg Madame Ping: Ah, I see... it's the Moonchase Festival, isn't it.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 05.ogg Madame Ping: How interesting... Haha, so, you came to hear some stories about the Stove God?
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 06.ogg Madame Ping: I see... The great stone surfaces, and so you open an investigation. Hehe.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 07.ogg Madame Ping: I must commend your guesswork this far. I did indeed know the Stove God of whom you speak. But it was a great many years ago.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 08.ogg Madame Ping: Moonchase was originally a rite observed by the adepti — not something in which the ordinary people of Liyue would ever partake. But over the years they have sought to emulate it for themselves many times, giving rise to various festivals bearing the Moonchase name.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 09.ogg Madame Ping: On nights when the moon shone bright, everybody would get together for joyful reunions. There would be fine food, fine wines, and choice teas.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 10.ogg Madame Ping: Later, Rex Lapis unified all of these various festivals under the Moonchase name, to honor an old friend of his. In short, the heavens were our witness as we vowed to the moon to come together in joyful solidarity, to remember the past and reflect upon the present. That is the meaning of the Moonchase Festival.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 11.ogg Madame Ping: Hehe... That friend made many contributions to Liyue, and Rex Lapis would not have them go unrecognized. Turning this season into a commemoration of his old friend was also a way to honor that friendship.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 12.ogg Madame Ping: I can only presume that the Stove God Festival was one of the many subsumed into the Moonchase Festival.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 13.ogg Madame Ping: Oh, Keqing, I simply won't allow you to be so down on yourself. Nothing would delight Rex Lapis more than to know that those who follow in his footsteps continue to value these traditions and are working tirelessly to do them justice.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 14.ogg Madame Ping: Do you want to know who Rex Lapis' friend was?
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 15.ogg Madame Ping: Yes, precisely. There are few genuine coincidences in the world... the story of the lost festival and the old friend are indeed one and the same.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 16.ogg Madame Ping: The Stove God was a good friend of mine too. What a pity it is that the god is now gone both from the world and from people's memories.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 17.ogg Madame Ping: It is to everyone's regret that the Stove God passed. But gods cannot be fully destroyed, and we made a pact to wait until the land became fruitful once more, for perhaps the Stove God would then return, albeit in a new form.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 18.ogg Madame Ping: Yes, thinking back on it all, there are many fond memories.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 19.ogg Madame Ping: I'm pleasantly surprised to find that Keqing is investigating this. She is a tenacious child, and anything she sets her mind to, she will diligently pursue. It warms my heart, and makes me want to give her a helping hand.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 20.ogg Madame Ping: Unfortunately, however, I cannot simply give her the answer, for the process is of great importance to her.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 21.ogg Madame Ping: Keqing's grandfather once researched the Stove God, and now she follows in his footsteps... Since Keqing has inherited this conundrum, so too she must inherit the journey to its resolution.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 22.ogg Madame Ping: Of course! I count all the people of Liyue among my good friends. I remember when he was the same age as Keqing is now.... Ah, so young. Hehe.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 23.ogg Madame Ping: Grandparent and grandchild are definitely made from the same mold. Both diligent enough to take on anything, and bold enough to see it through to the end.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 24.ogg Madame Ping: I like to think of Liyue as my own little potted plant. I've watched it grow and blossom, and it grows more beautiful all the time. In the blink of an eye, the buds of yesterday are in full bloom today... It's wonderful to see.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 25.ogg Madame Ping: For new blossoms must bloom on the branches if the tree is to remain evergreen and ever young.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 26.ogg Madame Ping: My dears, you are absolutely right to focus your investigation on the stone. It is, as you suppose, the lost Statue of the Stove God, and within it lie all the answers that you seek.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 27.ogg Madame Ping: I should like to see the stone for myself, if you would lead me to it. Perhaps the truth will emerge even as we watch on.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Madame Ping is Xiangling's master!?
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh... Paimon does!
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You knew Keqing's grandpa?
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 soldier 01.ogg Xiangsheng: Lady Keqing!
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 soldier 02.ogg Xiangsheng: Lady Keqing, Lady Ningguang wishes to speak with you.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: Master!
(Guoba waves to Madame Ping)
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 xiangling 02.ogg Xiangling: Master, how are you keeping these days? Are you well?
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 xiangling 03.ogg Xiangling: Master, we came here because we have a question for you. Do you know about the Stove God?
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 xiangling 04.ogg Xiangling: There she goes... Keqing's a lot more serious when she's got her work face on.
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 xiangling 05.ogg Xiangling: How could that happen...
Media:vo eqzyj001 17 xiangling 06.ogg Xiangling: Really? ...Master, you must miss the Stove God a lot, right? From the way you talk about it all, it sounds like you were the best of friends.
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: Ah, you're all here! I was just about to send someone to fetch you.
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 02.ogg Keqing: A crack has appeared in one corner. But we still can't tell what's inside.
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 03.ogg Keqing: More likely a natural occurrence. Our weapons have had no effect on it.
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 04.ogg Keqing: Statues draw power from their people... so if the Stove God has dominion over cooking, could it be that the passion people put into their cooking gives power to the Stove God?
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 05.ogg Keqing: Ningguang and I chose "Feast of the Bounteous Land" as this year's theme, and now every chef signed up for the competition is busy preparing... Paimon's theory is not an unreasonable one.
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 06.ogg Keqing: Okay. The fact that cooking is involved gives us a perfect opportunity.
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 07.ogg Keqing: The selections phase of Masterful Chefs will be held indoors and seen by only a few people, but the finals will be held outside, in public. Everyone who wants to will be able to come and watch it. The atmosphere will be incredibly lively, no question.
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 08.ogg Keqing: It's definitely a possibility.
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 09.ogg Keqing: Yes. For a chef as accomplished as yourself, getting to the finals should be a breeze.
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 madameping 01.ogg Madame Ping: Keqing, has the stone undergone any changes?
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 madameping 02.ogg Madame Ping: This is because the Stove God draws power from the actions of the masses. The heat of a busy kitchen, the joy of a reunion... Haha, keep up the good work and the truth will rise to the surface soon enough.
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 madameping 03.ogg Madame Ping: Hahaha, well, we'll have to see then, won't we?
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What happened? Did someone chip it while no one else was looking?
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: All the books say that the Stove God is the deity of food. So is this stone opening up because everyone's cooking for the festival?
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So if the stone cracked because Liyue started getting festive, that must mean that when the festive fever peaks, it'll bust right open! Right?
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: And when the finals end, boom! We'll get to see who the Stove God really is. Right?
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: All this talk of cooking competitions is making Paimon hungry... Ah, Paimon can't wait! It'd be great if Paimon could take a nap and then wake up when it's the finals!
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: How would a "natural occurrence" crack it open?
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 xiangling 02.ogg Xiangling: Plus, a lot of families have reunion feasts around this time. With everyone back home, the whole city's bustling with people, and that adds a lot to the festive atmosphere.
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 xiangling 03.ogg Xiangling: That's gotta be it! Right, Master?
Media:vo eqzyj001 18 xiangling 04.ogg Xiangling: Well I've already signed up, so I should be able to help!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 chefmao 01.ogg Chef Mao: Ah, Traveler, welcome! Good to see you. What can I get for you?
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 chefmao 02.ogg Chef Mao: Alright, Black-Back Perch Stew it is! Make yourselves at home, it'll be right out for you in just a moment.
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 chefmao 03.ogg Chef Mao: That's right! Getting some suggestions from friends will broaden your horizons!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 chefmao 04.ogg Chef Mao: Here's your Black-Back Perch Stew, folks!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 chefmao 05.ogg Chef Mao: Haha, it's my pleasure.
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 chefmao 06.ogg Chef Mao: Xiangling can be a bit of a handful, so please look out for her while you're out and about.
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 chefmao 07.ogg Chef Mao: Because I know you all too well, my dear, that's why. You mustn't be quite so reckless when you're out in the wild, you understand? You'd do well to be a little more cautious, like our Traveler friend.
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, guess who's here~!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We want some Black-Back Perch Stew!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Thanks, Chef Mao!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: You mean, you were about to come looking for us?
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Moonchase Festival? Is that another one of Liyue's ancient traditions?
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Sounds like Paimon's kind of festival!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Hey! If you've got a problem with Paimon's taste, just spit it out!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Masterful Chefs, huh? So is that, like, a competition?
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Feast of the Bounteous Land... pretty much sums up what Liyue's all about. Great theme!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: This'll be a piece of cake! We've got friends from all over the map, haven't we, (Traveler)?
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Well, y'know, not to brag or anything...
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: But first things first, let's have a delicious Wanmin meal... After that, we can go around all our friends in Liyue and get their ideas one by one.
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Mmm! It smells so good!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Don't worry, we're all friends here. Let's all look out for each other!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Mmm... That was so delicious! Theory confirmed, this is definitely chili pepper weather!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Alright, let's pack up and head out!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: Oh, no way! It's the Traveler, and Paimon!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 02.ogg Xiangling: I was just thinking about you guys, and now you're here! It feels like you heard my call and came running, tee-hee.
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 03.ogg Xiangling: Uh-huh, there's something I wanna discuss with you guys. Did you happen to see how the city looked on the way over here? Everyone's getting ready for the Moonchase Festival!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 04.ogg Xiangling: That's right! Moonchase is a big festival where we celebrate the arrival of the fall by moonlight. The old folks say that thousands of years ago, this was the time of year when the adepti would seek the Way.
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 05.ogg Xiangling: But it's completely different nowadays. We eat our favorite foods, spend time with friends and relatives, enjoy the moon and the flowers... so much easier. Basically, we just do all the things that people like doing and don't take a whole lot of effort.
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 06.ogg Xiangling: *chuckle* With your great taste in food, Moonchase Festival is sure to be to your liking!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 07.ogg Xiangling: Um, so are you guys free these days? I'm taking part in this year's Masterful Chefs. If possible, I'd like you to be my culinary consultants!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 08.ogg Xiangling: Oh right, yeah, I guess you probably haven't heard about it before.
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 09.ogg Xiangling: Every year, Moonchase Festival has a different theme — usually picked by the Qixing. This year's theme is Feast of the Bounteous Land, so the Qixing decided to organize a cooking competition.
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 10.ogg Xiangling: I totally agree! I heard it was Ningguang that came up with it. She's so amazing... and so full of mystery.
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 11.ogg Xiangling: Well, I wanna take part in the competition, but coming up with new dishes is hard work. By the time you've finally thought of something, cooked it, taste-tested it... it can be hard to judge whether you're really onto something or not.
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 12.ogg Xiangling: So I was thinking I could get the two of you to help by gathering everyone's thoughts on what makes a great dish! I really want to think outside the box this time, and to do that I'm gonna need lots of different ideas from lots of different people.
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 13.ogg Xiangling: Hee-hee, you sound pretty confident!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 14.ogg Xiangling: Okay, great! Also, Guoba should be back soon, so we can all go together!
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 15.ogg Xiangling: C'mon Dad! Why would you say that!?
Media:vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 16.ogg Xiangling: Ah! And Guoba's back! Roly-polying around, as usual.
Media:vo eqzyj001 24 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: There's Yanxiao!
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 01.ogg Hu Tao: What what what? My ears are burning... did somebody say my name?
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 02.ogg Hu Tao: Aiya, it's Paimon and the Traveler! And Xiangling too!
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 03.ogg Hu Tao: Meaning... you're here for some other reason, right? How might I be of assistance?
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 04.ogg Hu Tao: What food I like? Hmm... off the top of my head, I don't really have an answer.
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 05.ogg Hu Tao: Come on, even the chirpiest birds clock out for the night, right? I'm no different.
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 06.ogg Hu Tao: I see, I see! Launching a new dish? Well, let me say right off the bat — nothing weird, okay! Some poached fish, a side of shrimp dumplings, that's all you need!
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 07.ogg Hu Tao: Well, it is and it isn't. Think about it, poached fish is hot and spicy with a powerful aroma. It's a "dynamic" dish. Add a side of shrimp dumplings, and there's your "static" component. Got it?
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 08.ogg Hu Tao: Not that kind of dynamic! A dish is more than substance, it's a mood. Poached fish is red and spicy. It elicits a response from the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. That's why I call it "dynamic."
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 09.ogg Hu Tao: Shrimp dumplings are more subdued — clear and smooth with a pure and subtle fragrance. I call that "static." Combining dynamic and static is how you create a perfectly balanced meal, a union between opposite but complementary features co-existing in perfect harmony!
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 10.ogg Hu Tao: Bingo! Except, I don't think you need to have a sweet dish for it to be a complete meal. Personally, I always skip dessert.
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 11.ogg Hu Tao: Hmm? Sounds suspiciously like a compliment to me. I'll take it!
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 12.ogg Hu Tao: Aha! Well, at least one of you gets it!
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 13.ogg Hu Tao: Everything in this world runs on its own set of principles, be it the circle of life or sugar and spice! You either get it or you don't.
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 14.ogg Hu Tao: Bubu Pharmacy... Yeah, you'll definitely get some interesting responses over there. Hehehe...
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So it's outside-the-box thinking that we're looking for, right? Hu Tao always seems to have a unique perspective, so let's make this our first stop!
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wow, so even Hu Tao gets lost for words sometimes. Paimon sure didn't see that coming.
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Pretty sure "clocking out" isn't something birds do, but okay...
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Paimon didn't follow that at all... but at the same time, it kinda sounded smart, so...
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Um, is this just another way of saying you should keep everything balanced? Y'know, a little meat, a little veggie? A little salt, a little sugar?
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: When it comes to telling tales, the storytellers have got nothing on Hu Tao.
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Paimon thinks we're pretty much done here now. Let's head to Bubu Pharmacy next.
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: Of course, Hu Tao! Way, way outside the box!
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 02.ogg Xiangling: Well, Hu Tao, I wanted to ask you: What kind of food do you like?
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 03.ogg Xiangling: Right! There's no need to over complicate it, just pick a dish and tell me what you like about it! I'm doing some market research.
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 04.ogg Xiangling: Poached fish and shrimp dumplings? That's a bit ordinary, isn't it?
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 05.ogg Xiangling: Dynamic...?
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 06.ogg Xiangling: Oh, oh.... I—I can do dynamic! Mushroom Slime Stew—
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 07.ogg Xiangling: Okay... dynamic and static, opposite but complementary...
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 08.ogg Xiangling: Okay, I think I got it! At first, I thought you were just goofing around, but actually you make a really good point!
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 09.ogg Xiangling: Hee-hee, how did I ever doubt you, Hu Tao! Thanks!
Media:vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 10.ogg Xiangling: Since the Traveler seems to approve, I'll make sure to factor it in.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 baizhu 01.ogg Baizhu: Haha, welcome, welcome. Here to procure an herbal remedy, I presume?
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 baizhu 02.ogg Baizhu: Qiqi has some gustatory dysfunction and can't taste any food. Make no mistake, she's not being uncooperative.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 baizhu 03.ogg Baizhu: I agree with Changsheng.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 baizhu 04.ogg Baizhu: Many of our patients are the elderly and young children. They find large chunks of Fowl or seafood difficult to swallow and digest. Dishes where the ingredients have been finely chopped, on the other hand, are far more suitable for them.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 baizhu 05.ogg Baizhu: We also see plenty of people with colds and sore throats who find it difficult to eat rich food... From a purely pharmaceutical perspective, I tend to recommend soups and stews.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 baizhu 06.ogg Baizhu: I must apologize for having such a one-track mind... It's a little difficult to think about food without worrying about the health implications these days. We've had quite the endless stream of patients recently... If you ask me, I think the changing weather is to blame.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 baizhu 07.ogg Baizhu: Oh, how you flatter me.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 changsheng 01.ogg Changsheng: Why, if it isn't the special guests who seldom visit. Less busy than usual, I see.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 changsheng 02.ogg Changsheng: Sss! Excuse me! The neck!
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 changsheng 03.ogg Changsheng: Hahaha, most astutely self-corrected. We shall surely supply our assistance.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 changsheng 04.ogg Changsheng: I like bite-sized morsels of meat.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 changsheng 05.ogg Changsheng: Receptivity to sensible suggestions makes for a savvy chef.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yikes, wh—what happened to Baizhu's voice!?
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh... it's just Changsheng...
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: No no, we actually came for the conversation this time. We're here to talk food!
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Well that doesn't help us. It's not a dish, it's a drink...
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: That's okay, everyone's input counts. Keeping it seasonal and suitable for all ages sounds like a pretty good idea to Paimon.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Oh, she is! Creating new dishes is Xiangling's favorite thing to do, you can be sure she'll put lots of care and attention into it!
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Great! That makes this whole trip worth it.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Alright, time to move on to the next! So we've got an independent thinker's perspective and a health perspective... Next, Paimon thinks we should probably talk to some picky eaters.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 01.ogg Qiqi: Oh, it's you. Is everything okay?
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 02.ogg Qiqi: You need to know... what food I like? Hmm...
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 03.ogg Qiqi: It's all the same. No flavor.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 04.ogg Qiqi: Sensation? Hmm... Yes. There's one.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 05.ogg Qiqi: Coconut milk... Nice and cold...
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 06.ogg Qiqi: Whew, medicinal soup... I don't like it.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 07.ogg Qiqi: Food with substance, always better. Everyone will like it.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 08.ogg Qiqi: You're welcome. As long as we could help.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: I'm entering this year's cooking competition, so I wanted to ask you both... wait, there's three of you! I wanted to ask the three of you about what kind of food you like.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 02.ogg Xiangling: Oh, I understand, that's fine! Still, I'd expect Qiqi to have some sort of dietary preferences, though. There must be some dishes that you like the sensation of?
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 03.ogg Xiangling: How about you two? Any thoughts?
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 04.ogg Xiangling: Got it. Would that be medicinal soups and stews?
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 05.ogg Xiangling: Medicinal dishes have higher demands in terms of nutritional balance than the kind of food I normally cook. I don't usually focus on medicinal properties, but since this is for a competition... maybe I can score more points by taking both flavor and function into account.
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 06.ogg Xiangling: It's a great suggestion! Thanks everyone!
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 07.ogg Xiangling: It's great to have a doctor's unique perspective. I'm feeling inspired!
Media:vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 08.ogg Xiangling: Hee-hee... Everyone's got their hobbies, and mine is cooking! Usually, I just go with my own ideas, but having a whole new perspective this time is sure to make a big difference to the end result.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 01.ogg Beidou: Hey! What brings you here?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 02.ogg Beidou: None here. You know how to get things done, Keqing. As long as it's with you, I can rest easy knowing that it's in safe hands.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 03.ogg Beidou: Huh? Well, for starters, Keqing is the one who's always out running errands, rain or shine. Besides, you don't seem to give a wooden Mora about this whole thing anyway, so what's it to you!
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 04.ogg Beidou: You... Ugh, fine...
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 05.ogg Beidou: Well... It's a big one, right? And such a smooth surface, too. Makes you think there's gotta be a good chunk of jade in there.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 06.ogg Beidou: That's your idea of simple, huh?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 07.ogg Beidou: A few weeks out on the open ocean would fix your flawed definition of simplicity, let me tell you that.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 08.ogg Beidou: Me? Uh... if it's freshly cooked and piping hot, that floats my boat. If it's got a little chili pepper in there too, I'm one very happy Captain.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 09.ogg Beidou: Hahaha, oh, bar food works too!
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 10.ogg Beidou: Hahaha, no, at least not outright.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: Hmm? Oh, it's the Traveler and Paimon... and Xiangling.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 02.ogg Keqing: Long story... So, just to confirm, I will assume responsibility for handling this stone of unknown origin. Any objections?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 03.ogg Keqing: It was found by a fishing crew not far off the coast. It must have been underwater for years, so the erosion will be what's given it that smooth finish.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 04.ogg Keqing: Well, we've hit it with just about every weapon we could get our hands on and haven't managed to even dent it yet. Clearly, there's more to it than meets the eye.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 05.ogg Keqing: Let's put that aside for a second. Traveler, what brings you here? Were you looking for someone?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 06.ogg Keqing: ...Food preferences? That's a little unexpected.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 07.ogg Keqing: As for me... it's got to be seafood.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 08.ogg Keqing: (*gasp* Oh my... they're my favorite...)
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 09.ogg Keqing: I heartily agree. Golden Shrimp Balls are a prime example. Their essence lies in combining art and nutrition in a single package. It is a dish of true value.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 10.ogg Keqing: I—I didn't say that! ...Did I?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 11.ogg Keqing: Traveler, Paimon, do you have anything planned after this?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 12.ogg Keqing: Good. I'd like you to help me investigate something. It's about this stone...
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 13.ogg Keqing: My thoughts exactly. The Qixing has a public duty to deliver our final verdict to the fisherman, but there are also some things I would like to investigate on a personal level.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 14.ogg Keqing: I'm sure you've become acquainted with the general background of the Moonchase Festival. However, I have my own understanding of this festival's roots.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 15.ogg Keqing: My grandfather was a researcher of Liyue's traditions. In his notes, he indicated that there was a deity called the Stove God in ancient Liyue which people paid tribute to at a certain time of the year.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 16.ogg Keqing: Very few written records make mention of the Stove God, and those that do are notoriously confusing. Some scholars believe that the Stove God was just another title held by the Lord of Geo, but others suggest that this was a different deity altogether...
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 17.ogg Keqing: One folktale even claims that the ancients found the Stove God's shrine, but there was no statue — only a huge, smooth slab of stone.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 18.ogg Keqing: Shortly after it was found, the stone was lost in transit, and it hasn't been seen since. This stone here has all the same features, so I suspect it could be the one that went missing all those years ago.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 19.ogg Keqing: After many years of researching ancient texts, my grandfather came to believe that the practice of paying seasonal tribute to the Stove God may be best described as a festival — he called it the Stove God Festival. That would make it the forerunner to the Moonchase Festival we know today.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 20.ogg Keqing: But this is all just theory and conjecture. To prove any of it, we'd need to start by identifying who the Stove God really was.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 21.ogg Keqing: Now that Rex Lapis has passed on and Liyue has entered the age of humankind, his successors should continue to respect our nation's culture and traditions, just as he did.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 22.ogg Keqing: That's why I think the responsibility for this situation should fall to me. It's a chance to shed light on our history, revitalize an ancient tradition, and possibly prove my grandfather's hypothesis along the way. With any luck, we'll nail all three in one fell swoop.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 23.ogg Keqing: It was just a couple of days ago that we received this stone — right after we decided to use food as the central theme for this year's festival. It makes me wonder... maybe a divine will is at work behind all of this.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 24.ogg Keqing: Wh—What? Why are you shouting?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 25.ogg Keqing: Huh? But...
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 26.ogg Keqing: If it means that much to you... Okay, I suppose you can come.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 27.ogg Keqing: Ahem! Now that that's settled... Time to get going. Qingce Village is said to be home to a lot of historical texts, so I'd like to start by making some inquiries there.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Greetings, friends. It's been a while.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Should I take this to mean that you doubt the relative safety of leaving this in the hands of the Tianquan?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: I was merely joking. You, meanwhile, seem only too ready to pounce when an opportunity to publicly lambaste me arises, even when it means giving our poor mutual friend here the cold shoulder.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: By no means. You wish to know about the stone, I presume? Then let me invite the great seafarer, Captain Beidou, to tell the story — if she would be so kind.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: Finds like this cannot be kept as private property, and must be submitted to a holder of public office. Placing it into our custody will also give them peace of mind.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: Keqing has taken an unusually keen interest in this giant stone, which is why we are leaving the matter in her capable hands.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: Oh? Hopefully not because there's been some sort of cataclysmic event?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: I have rather simple tastes. Precise, pure, smart, and sophisticated. That is all I require.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: I summed up my culinary requirements in four words. Is that insufficiently simple for you?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What's with this great big stone on the ground?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: No weapon could smash it open? Wow... Paimon doesn't think we've ever encountered a stone like that before...
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Actually, we were looking for all of you! We need all hands on deck here!
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Paimon thought you would've said bar food.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh, so what you're saying is... for all the frills and trills, good food is all the same at the core?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: You picked the right people for the job. We investigate stuff all the time!
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Three birds with one stone, huh? That's pretty efficient — even for Keqing!
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Alright, then it's off to Qingce we go!
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: Has something happened?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 02.ogg Xiangling: So, what's inside it?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 03.ogg Xiangling: No no, nothing like that! Paimon's just getting carried away... I just wanted to ask everyone about their food preferences.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 04.ogg Xiangling: What about you, Beidou?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 05.ogg Xiangling: Okay, got it! So, seafood, piping hot, and, uh, simple-but-sophisticated...
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 06.ogg Xiangling: That's where I would disagree! Traveler, surely you've heard of Golden Shrimp Balls?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 07.ogg Xiangling: You need to wash and de-vein the shrimp, wrap it in finely sliced potato strips, then deep fry it to perfection. There's no room for cutting corners!
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 08.ogg Xiangling: They're very precisely put together, they taste pure, the presentation is smart, and the skill needed to cook them is highly sophisticated... It fits Ningguang's four-word summary to the letter!
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 09.ogg Xiangling: Okay, got it — so, Keqing loves Golden Shrimp Balls...
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 10.ogg Xiangling: Alrighty! Thanks for all of your input! I'll be sure to take it all into consideration!
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 11.ogg Xiangling: Hey, don't worry about that. This sounds super important, so don't mind me.
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 12.ogg Xiangling: Besides, we were only... Hmm? Wait a second... I got it!!!
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 13.ogg Xiangling: Keqing, can I tag along for your investigation?
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 14.ogg Xiangling: Since it's all about the Stove God, I might get to learn something useful about cooking along the way. It'll be great inspiration for me in the competition!
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 15.ogg Xiangling: Please? Lemme come along. I promise I'll help!
Media:vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 16.ogg Xiangling: Really!? Yay, thank you so much! You're the best!
Media:vo eqzyj001 6 grannyruoxin 01.ogg Granny Ruoxin: Oh, looking for ancient texts, are we? Let me think...
Media:vo eqzyj001 6 grannyruoxin 02.ogg Granny Ruoxin: There is an old warehouse over there, property of the Feiyun Commerce Guild. Many books are stored inside — those that they have no room for at home. In fact, their youngest comes over this way to read sometimes.
Media:vo eqzyj001 6 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: The Feiyun Commerce Guild's youngest? You must be talking about Xingqiu.
Media:vo eqzyj001 6 keqing 02.ogg Keqing: Hmm? It came from that direction. Come on!
Media:vo eqzyj001 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hi granny, we need your help with something!
Media:vo eqzyj001 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Are there any old books around in Qingce Village? You know, from a really long time ago.
Media:vo eqzyj001 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Paimon didn't know they had a warehouse here. Let's go take a look!
Media:vo eqzyj001 6 sheng 01.ogg ???: Help! I'm being robbed!
Media:vo eqzyj001 8 sheng 01.ogg Sheng: Ugh... I've come here to clean the book warehouse plenty of times before, but this is the first time I've run into these crooks...
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 01.ogg Chongyun: Hello, one and all.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 02.ogg Chongyun: Yes, I'm just along for the ride really...
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 03.ogg Chongyun: I come from a long lineage of exorcists, and our family too has amassed a number of ancient texts. Now that you mention the Stove God, I seem to recall reading somewhere that this god once appeared at the Guili Assembly. Of course, I can't say if it's true or not.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 04.ogg Chongyun: Food? Oh no... Y—You're not thinking of taking part in Masterful Chefs, are you!?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 05.ogg Chongyun: Xiangling, this is a major event. I beg you, please don't cook anything strange for this competition...
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 06.ogg Chongyun: Well, in that case... I like cold food.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 07.ogg Chongyun: Haha, yes, you're absolutely right.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 08.ogg Chongyun: These are just personal preferences, and everyone's are quite different... Are you sure this eclectic mix of opinions will be of any use?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 09.ogg Chongyun: Yes, best of luck! If you run into any difficulties, come and find us. We'll be only too glad to help!
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: We'll try not to take up too much of your time. I understand that this book warehouse is the property of the Feiyun Commerce Guild? Could you advise whether we might find any texts relating to the Stove God in this collection?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 02.ogg Keqing: Seems logical enough...
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 03.ogg Keqing: But do you have any books on the topic?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 04.ogg Keqing: Master Xingqiu, if I may be so bold — do you happen to know if there are any texts on the subject of the Stove God among this collection?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 05.ogg Keqing: Might I take a look?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 06.ogg Keqing: Yes. Master Xingqiu has quite an exceptional memory, "Demystifying the Legends of Liyue" does indeed mention the Stove God. However...
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 07.ogg Keqing: It says the following: "The body of the dragon wielded a tail that could eclipse the sun, and claws to command fire and teach the ways of wisdom. Receiving the gift bequeathed unto them, humankind cooked food with fire, and thus did they prosper."
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 08.ogg Keqing: That much is true. But this is the only passage in the whole book. If we want to find out more, we'll have to continue our investigation.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 09.ogg Keqing: There's nothing further to discover here. It seems we'll have to look at other options.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 10.ogg Keqing: Your help thus far is quite ample. Liyue is a vast and rich land, all things that existed here in the past have left their trace. So long as we do not abandon our search, it is sure to bear fruit eventually.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 11.ogg Keqing: Thank you all. We will continue our investigation elsewhere.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 12.ogg Keqing: Hmm...
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 13.ogg Keqing: So we've learned the Stove God allegedly made an appearance at the Guili Assembly. But today, that place is largely a wasteland, with few traces of human activity.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 14.ogg Keqing: Wangshu Inn is close by, so let's stop off there on the way over and see what we can find out.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? Really?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hey, it's Chongyun and Xingqiu!
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: They're back! So, did you find it?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: That's 'cause you can't handle hot and spicy, right?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: No surprises from Guhua Geek.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: If anyone can win hearts and minds with their cooking, it's gotta be someone like Xiangling. She's got pure intentions and really cares about the customers.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Over to you, Keqing. Where to next?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Let's go! Next stop, Wangshu Inn!
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 sheng 01.ogg Sheng: I am, thanks to all of you. Hey, wait a minute — you're the Traveler, aren't you? And you're with... Lady Keqing! An honor, truly an honor!
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 sheng 02.ogg Sheng: The Stove God? Uh... I heard that's the Lord of Geo, right?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 sheng 03.ogg Sheng: Yeah, a friend of mine who conducts research mentioned it once before. We use stoves for cooking, and stoves are built from rock.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 sheng 04.ogg Sheng: Some people think that the stove is a gift from the Lord of Geo, and that's why they call him the Stove God.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 sheng 05.ogg Sheng: Um... I, uh... I'm sorry, I'd have to ask the young master about that...
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: Are you alright?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 02.ogg Xiangling: Hey guys, what are you doing here?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 03.ogg Xiangling: The body of a dragon? The stories about Rex Lapis say the same thing.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 04.ogg Xiangling: Ah, hold up! I had a question too! Xingqiu, Chongyun, could you tell me what kind of food you like?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 05.ogg Xiangling: Uh, yeah, I totally am! What's wrong... You look like you've just seen a ghost!
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 06.ogg Xiangling: What do you mean, "strange"!?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 07.ogg Xiangling: Okay, fair enough, that dish isn't my most popular... but that's why I'm doing all this research, so I can create some really special dishes to win everyone over.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 08.ogg Xiangling: Okay, another mild child... Got it.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 09.ogg Xiangling: Of course! You're my customers, and putting a smile on customers' faces is my calling as a chef!
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 10.ogg Xiangling: Where's all this praise coming from...? Knock it off guys, you're embarrassing me...
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 11.ogg Xiangling: Ah! Sorry for holding you all up — that's all I needed to know! Shall we carry on with the investigation now?
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 01.ogg Xingqiu: Any questions? Please, ask away!
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 02.ogg Xingqiu: I was bored with nothing to do and thought I'd come out this way for a bit of reading. And then I thought, why not bring Chongyun along, too.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 03.ogg Xingqiu: I see the Yuheng, Keqing, is with you. Whatever brings you here must surely be a matter of grave importance.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 04.ogg Xingqiu: Since I personally selected which volumes to store here, I do have some recollection of their contents.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 05.ogg Xingqiu: If my memory betrays me not, there is one volume among them called "Demystifying the Legends of Liyue," which mentions the Stove God.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 06.ogg Xingqiu: Certainly. If it pleases my lady, I shall lead the way. Sheng, I will take care of things here. You're free to go about your own business.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 07.ogg Xingqiu: Books are penned by people. All they can do is show what the author was thinking. Everyone's mind is different, so every book on a given topic will give a different account.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 08.ogg Xingqiu: I apologize that we could not help in a more substantial capacity.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 09.ogg Xingqiu: Mushroom Slime Stew, to give one example.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 10.ogg Xingqiu: My tastes are on the mild side — I prefer gentle dishes with minimal seasoning. Soups and stews, vegetables in broth, seafood or freshwater fish, either boiled or steamed... These kinds of dishes I am most partial to.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 11.ogg Xingqiu: Though Xiangling's market research blade stabs often into the dark, her heart never strays from the noble path.
Media:vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 12.ogg Xingqiu: Forgive us, for this is where we must part ways. May your journey be a smooth one.
The young thaumaturge Chongyun was born to a clan of exorcists. He travels the land, working to exorcise demons.
These "books" refer to the thrilling heroic tales of heroes and heroines out in the wilds — tales of mercy, romance, and vengeance. "Chivalry," on the other hand, refers to aiding the weak and going wherever one pleases.
This pure-yang spirit is capable of repelling demons to point where Chongyun has never had to lift a finger to stop them. As a result, he has almost never seen a demon in his life.
This troubles Chongyun greatly, of course — because seriously, what exorcist has never encountered a demon to exorcise before?
This young director is known for her sharp intellect, but in some peoples' eyes, Hu Tao might be a little too smart for her own good.
When speaking to him, if one hears some odd and obscure line like "through war, harmony," it is quite likely to just be a quote from the latest martial arts novel he has been reading.
