 Aw, I was just getting started.
Katheryne: Haha, it seems like you enjoyed yourself, then. That's wonderful.
 Quest DescriptionAfter a sustained effort, you seem to have scared the Geovishaps into submission and the disturbances across the land seem to have subsided. However, the reason for their re-emergence and rampage remains a mystery...
 So, we're finally done...
Katheryne: Thank you for alleviating the pressure on the Guild.
Katheryne: Adventurer, thanks to your hard work, the Geovishap investigation can be brought to a close.
Katheryne: All the adventurers who took leave to visit their families have now returned and reported in at the Guild. You have already made a great contribution, so please, leave the remaining work to us.
Katheryne: As for why these ancient creatures suddenly began appearing, we will continue to investigate.
Katheryne: Haha, it seems like you enjoyed yourself, then. That's wonderful.
Katheryne: Oh, and don't forget to claim your investigation rewards.
Katheryne: Thank you for alleviating the pressure on the Guild.
Katheryne: The Adventurers' Guild looks forward to your continued excellence! Ad astra abyssosque!
