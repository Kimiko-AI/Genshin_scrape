 I wouldn't say no to that.
 Isn't that dangerous?
 Quest DescriptionPlauen of the Adventurers' Guild would like to introduce you to a mysterious Domain in the wilds of Mondstadt.
 Seems like a special one.
 Will do â€” so long as there's a reward.
 Will do.
Plauen: According to our records, it seems to only appear at specific times.
Plauen: I doubt that you'll need any help on that front, though, veteran that you are.
Plauen: It's the Windblume Festival at the moment, so we made a few modifications to the interior to turn it into a unique challenge before opening it to the public.
Plauen: Not to worry. This is a special event organized to celebrate this festival. We'll have seasoned adventurers accompanying anyone who doesn't have any adventuring experience.
Plauen: Then I shan't delay you any longer. Have fun in there!
Plauen: Welcome! Did you come here to challenge the domain in front of your very eyes?
Plauen: You can explore this Domain alone or invite some friends to come along. Either way, you'll receive a reward if you make it to the end.
Plauen: You've found the right guy, then. Allow me to introduce it to you. I'm Plauen of the Adventurers' Guild, in charge of securing the entrance to this domain.
