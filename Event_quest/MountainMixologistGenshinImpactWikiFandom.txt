Georg: Ah, I guess I've been underestimated! Let's agree on the price I asked for this time. Think of it as your fee for negotiation skills.

Georg: Deal! You two are fast learners. The second time we did business, we ended up in a win-win situation for everyone!

Georg: No, no, that's too little! Even if the total number of the order is higher, the unit price per case shouldn't be this low.

Georg: Well, that's not a bad offer, but considering the difficulty of transportation to Qingce Village, it's still a tough one.

Georg: Yup, you guys drive a hard bargain!

 About the tea water...
Guanchui: The boys working the field are often real thirsty, so thirsty that they end up going through a whole jug of tea in half a day.
Guanchui: The distance between the tea shop and the fields is quite far. Going to and from is too much trouble.
Guanchui: Pops Kai is getting a little long in the tooth to bring tea to the boys, so it's now down to me to bring it over.
Guanchui: A couple of my companions and I went out of town for a while, and the big jug of tea was a little light for us. Sometimes, they wanted something a little stronger.
Guanchui: So I added something to my tea to bring out a refreshing flavor and let the boys have a little bit of fun.
Guanchui: Of course, I've only made enough for a couple brothers. Pops Kai still has a business to maintain!
Guanchui: After taking a break, we would also go to Pops Kai's tea shop and help him with chores.
 And you are...
 Best of luck, bartending chef!
 Could you tell me more about yourself?
Guanchui: It hasn't been that long since I moved back to the farm with my brothers. Usually I am in charge of cooking for the boys who work in the field.
Guanchui: But most of what I do is just simple and filling dishes, which are not quite suitable for out-of-town guests.
Guanchui: Qingce Village is pretty quiet, but there is no shortage of good food. You can tell by just simply walking around!
 Get ready to be surprised, Georg!
 Hello...
 Makes me want to try it...
 Quest DescriptionChef Guanchui, who has just recently returned to Qingce Village, seems to be worried about his friend's thirst-quenching drinks...
 That was quick...
 We'll be back soon.
Guanchui: Okay! I await the good news!
 Why do I get the feeling of business rivalry...
 You've been helpful too, Paimon...
Georg: Ah, I guess I've been underestimated! Let's agree on the price I asked for this time. Think of it as your fee for negotiation skills.
Georg: Are you still helping to place orders for foreign clients?
Georg: Deal! You two are fast learners. The second time we did business, we ended up in a win-win situation for everyone!
Georg: No, no, that's too little! Even if the total number of the order is higher, the unit price per case shouldn't be this low.
Georg: Oh! The ball's rolling! Let me see what you've got this time!
(A Mood gauge appears, starting at a random value of 3.75–4 Hearts)
Georg: Oh! You're back?
Georg: Okay, just like last time, the documents will be given to you, and I will arrange the transportation.
Georg: Since he is a new customer, you'd better give him the receipt, so as to make him feel at ease.
Georg: Well, that's not a bad offer, but considering the difficulty of transportation to Qingce Village, it's still a tough one.
Georg: Yup, you guys drive a hard bargain!
Guanchui: A couple of my companions and I went out of town for a while, and the big jug of tea was a little light for us. Sometimes, they wanted something a little stronger.
Guanchui: After taking a break, we would also go to Pops Kai's tea shop and help him with chores.
Guanchui: Ah, I like how direct you are! Then I'll cut to the chase, too.
Guanchui: Amazing! You two have been a big help!
Guanchui: Are you guys from out of town? Welcome to Qingce Village!
Guanchui: But most of what I do is just simple and filling dishes, which are not quite suitable for out-of-town guests.
Guanchui: Don't worry, I used to be a chef when I was abroad for a while. This approach achieves the best balance between cost and taste, and I've made it many times!
Guanchui: I can't think of a better specialty drink for this Weinlesefest than the tea brewed with the spring water from Qingce Village.
Guanchui: I will study the "Fruits of the Festival" carefully and mix the fresh drink with the tea with a specific proportion. I'll bring out the flavor, so that the workers will be able to work harder!
Guanchui: I'm Chef Guanchui, and I need 100 cases of "Fruits of the Festival," to make tea to help keep the spirits up for the guys doing manual labor.
Guanchui: It hasn't been that long since I moved back to the farm with my brothers. Usually I am in charge of cooking for the boys who work in the field.
Guanchui: Of course, I've only made enough for a couple brothers. Pops Kai still has a business to maintain!
Guanchui: Okay! I await the good news!
Guanchui: One step ahead of you. Please take these Fairbrew Jellies! After ordering, there will probably be some left over. Doesn't matter how much is left, please keep the change as reward for your hard work!
Guanchui: Pops Kai is getting a little long in the tooth to bring tea to the boys, so it's now down to me to bring it over.
Guanchui: Qingce Village is pretty quiet, but there is no shortage of good food. You can tell by just simply walking around!
Guanchui: Right on! I await the good news from both of you!
Guanchui: So I added something to my tea to bring out a refreshing flavor and let the boys have a little bit of fun.
Guanchui: Thank you! Come back when you've got time!
Guanchui: Thank you, both of you!
Guanchui: The boys working the field are often real thirsty, so thirsty that they end up going through a whole jug of tea in half a day.
Guanchui: The distance between the tea shop and the fields is quite far. Going to and from is too much trouble.
Guanchui: The next time you guys come to Qingce Village, I'll treat you guys to the finished product.
Paimon: Eh, sounds a bit like bartending, but with tea... Is that even possible?
Paimon: Guanchui, we're back!
Paimon: If you have anything to talk about, we'll talk after you place the order.
Paimon: Let's go, (Traveler). Let's head back to Qingce Village and report back.
(Obtain Guanchui's Invoice)
Paimon: Okay! Before we get to work, please give us the funds.
Paimon: Okay! Next time (Traveler) can try it!
Paimon: Opening a shop, mmhmm...
(Obtain Guanchui's Funds × 30000)
Paimon: Paimon first! Paimon first! Let's introduce ourselves first!
Paimon: The sooner we finish the job, the sooner we can open our shop!
Paimon: This is the almighty Traveler, (Traveler), and Paimon is this Traveler's best companion, Paimon.
Paimon: We are ordering specialty drinks from the Weinlesefest for out-of-town clients. We saw your commission, so we decided to come talk to you.
Paimon: We'll take it and be on our way!
Paimon: We're ready to make an offer, Georg!
Paimon: We've placed an order for your 100 cases of "Fruits of the Festival." Here's your receipt.
Paimon: What are you standing there for, (Traveler)? Let's go!
Paimon: You have a point. We thought so too!
Paimon: Yup. This time we need 100 cases of "Fruits of the Festival," for Guanchui, the chef of Qingce Village.
