 Chef Mao would like to treat you to a meal...
 Guanhai would like to have Squirrel Fish.
 Here's your order. Enjoy!
 I can take care of it for you.
 I recommend Bamboo Shoot Soup.
Hammer Li: That's a good one! I've heard a storyteller once describe it as a dish that's "simmered to perfection over a low flame, with a distinctive savory taste".
Wrench Wang: Sounds good to me, let's get that one then.
(Dialogue ends)
 I recommend Black-Back Perch Stew.
Guanhai: Ah yes, Wanmin Restaurant's signature dish. I've eaten it many times already, and it doesn't have that sweet and sour taste I'm hankering after... I think I'd prefer something else.
Guanhai: Hmm, can you recommend something else?
(Return to choices)
 I recommend Come and Get It.
Hammer Li: I heard storytellers say that Come and Get It is an exquisite dish, but there's no bamboo shoots. How 'bout something else?
Wrench Wang: Since when do storytellers ever talk about recipes? I've never heard them do that before...
Wrench Wang: Hmm, so that won't be any good. What else can you recommend?
(Return to choices)
 I recommend Crystal Shrimp.
Guanhai: Hmm, there's no fish in that dish, is there? Besides, the flavor's too bland, I think I'd prefer something else.
Guanhai: Hmm, can you recommend something else?
(Return to choices)
 I recommend Grilled Tiger Fish.
Zhihua: Grilled Tiger Fish is good and all... But the flavor is a little too strong for me and I'll smell like grilled fish for the rest of the day...
Zhihua: How about something else... Do you have any other recommendations?
(Return to choices)
 I recommend Lotus Flower Crisp.
Zhihua: Mm, that sounds good. It's nice and light and tastes great. That'll be perfect...
Zhihua: Alright, put me down for Lotus Flower Crisp, please.
(Dialogue ends)
 I recommend Squirrel Fish.
Guanhai: Oh right, that's the one! How could I forget Squirrel Fish!?
Guanhai: Sweet and sour flavor with a crispy texture. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I can't wait to taste more of Chef Mao's cuisine.
(Dialogue ends)
 I recommend Tianshu Meat.
Zhihua: That dish is a little too oily...
Zhihua: How about something else... Do you have any other recommendations?
(Return to choices)
 I'll make a Xiao Lantern for you.
 Leave it to me.
 Quest DescriptionOnce again, it's the Lantern Rite — and once again, Wanmin Restaurant's Chef Mao is busier than ever...
 So what would you like to eat?
 What are you doing?
 Won't you be hanging any Xiao Lanterns?
 Wrench Wang and Hammer Li would like to have Bamboo Shoot Soup.
 Yes, we did.
 Zhihua would like to have Lotus Flower Crisp.
(If delivered after timer ends)
Atsuko: You're here at last. I've been waiting for a while... Still, I'm grateful that you're still making deliveries during the festival period.
(If delivered before timer ends)
Atsuko: Oh, thank you so much! I'd thought that it would still take a while longer before it arrived.
Atsuko: All the festivities for Lantern Rite have been making me feel a little homesick... But I certainly won't be returning to Inazuma any time soon.
Atsuko: I wonder how things are back in Inazuma...
Atsuko: I wonder why my order from Wanmin Restaurant hasn't arrived yet...
Atsuko: Oh, thank you so much! I'd thought that it would still take a while longer before it arrived.
Atsuko: You're here at last. I've been waiting for a while... Still, I'm grateful that you're still making deliveries during the festival period.
Chef Mao: Did you deliver the food?
Chef Mao: Do you happen to know Atsuko? She's the girl from Inazuma down by the docks.
Chef Mao: Even though my dear Xiangling has returned to help, we're still struggling to keep our heads above water. As a matter of fact, she just went out on a delivery...
Chef Mao: Great, I knew that I could count on you! Did you also happen to ask Wrench Wang, Guanhai, and Zhihua what they would like to eat?
Chef Mao: Hah! We don't have time for that now, I've got more dishes to make and Xiangling has just gone out on another delivery...
Chef Mao: How many more dishes was that again...
Chef Mao: Huh, I never would have guessed that Zhihua would have a liking for pastries and the like. Making Lotus Flower Crisp is straightforward enough, no problem.
Chef Mao: I would like to prepare some food to give to them, but I'm afraid that we're simply too busy and won't have the chance to leave the restaurant...
Chef Mao: If you could, Traveler, please help me ask them what they would like to eat, and I'll whip up whatever they request.
Chef Mao: If you don't mind, Traveler, could you lend us a hand?
Chef Mao: Is the Xiao Lantern ready yet?
(Give the lantern)
Chef Mao: No problem, that dish is one of my specialties.
Chef Mao: Oh? These two have rather similar tastes, though Bamboo Shoot Soup will take some time to make. I'll have to start preparing it early.
Chef Mao: Thanks a lot, Traveler. Just come back here and let me know once you've asked them.
(Obtain Wanmin Restaurant Take-Away)
Chef Mao: Thanks for going and asking them what they'd like to eat. Here, take this as a token of my appreciation. Now, I should get started on all those dishes.
Chef Mao: Thanks for your help, Traveler. Here, take these as a token of my appreciation.
Chef Mao: The two of us can barely keep up with the orders as it is. There's no way we'd have time for hanging lanterns.
Chef Mao: There's also others who work down by the docks... Wrench Wang, Hammer Li, Guanhai, and Zhihua.
Chef Mao: They're regular patrons here and always look after our business. They seem to still be busy with work down by the docks, even though it's time for the festival.
Chef Mao: Things have been getting busy with everyone going out to eat during the Lantern Rite. Even travelers from far away lands have come to visit and join the festivities.
Chef Mao: This Xiao Lantern looks great! I'll be sure to write a wish on it shortly. Once Xiangling gets back, we can release the lantern together as father and daughter.
Chef Mao: We've prepared her order, so could you please go deliver the food to her? I've even made her extra large portions to celebrate the festival.
Chef Mao: What am I doing? Why, I'm running Wanmin Restaurant, of course! Haha.
Chef Mao: While everyone else has been out hanging lanterns for the festival, we've been too busy to make a single lantern yet.
Chef Mao: Y—You'd really do that? I'll leave the lantern to you then. I was just starting to worry that the restaurant doesn't look festive enough without any lanterns.
Guanhai: *sigh* Here I am still working while everyone else is out enjoying the festival...
Guanhai: *sigh* Here I am working while everyone else is out enjoying the festival...
Guanhai: Ah yes, Wanmin Restaurant's signature dish. I've eaten it many times already, and it doesn't have that sweet and sour taste I'm hankering after... I think I'd prefer something else.
Guanhai: Chef Mao would like to treat me to a meal? Hmm, it would be nice to kick back with a good meal and enjoy the festivities.
Guanhai: Hmm, can you recommend something else?
(Return to choices)
Guanhai: Hmm, there's no fish in that dish, is there? Besides, the flavor's too bland, I think I'd prefer something else.
Guanhai: I can't think of anything special off the top of my head. What would you recommend?
Guanhai: I really love the taste of fish. It would be great if it was fish paired with some special flavor - say, sweet-and-sour, perhaps...
Guanhai: Oh right, that's the one! How could I forget Squirrel Fish!?
Guanhai: Sweet and sour flavor with a crispy texture. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I can't wait to taste more of Chef Mao's cuisine.
(Dialogue ends)
Hammer Li: Alright, back to work...
Hammer Li: I heard storytellers say that Come and Get It is an exquisite dish, but there's no bamboo shoots. How 'bout something else?
Hammer Li: I'm not going to ask for too much, I'd be more than satisfied with just a sumptuous bowl of hot soup and some crisp bamboo shoots.
Hammer Li: Let's finish this up so we can finally have a rest and enjoy the festival...
Hammer Li: That's a good one! I've heard a storyteller once describe it as a dish that's "simmered to perfection over a low flame, with a distinctive savory taste".
Hammer Li: This is too good to be true! Please give Chef Mao my thanks...
Paimon: Go on...
Paimon: Hmm, Chef Mao also asked us to do something else, too... Oh, that's right!
Paimon: Oh, this dish is best while it's hot.
Paimon: Seems like we'll need a lot of dishes to feed everyone. We'd better get back and tell Chef Mao.
Paimon: Uh oh, the dish seems to be getting cold. I hope Atsuko won't be too disappointed...
Paimon: We should ask Guanhai, Zhihua, Wrench Wang, and Hammer Li what they would like to eat.
Paimon: We should deliver it to Atsuko right away
(If the food grows cold)
Wrench Wang: Hmm, so that won't be any good. What else can you recommend?
(Return to choices)
Wrench Wang: Huh? Oh, I remember Chef Mao did say something about treating us to a meal during Lantern Rite. I guess he was serious, hahaha!
Wrench Wang: I'll never finish all this work...
Wrench Wang: I'm not picky, anything with meat is good enough for me. I'm not one for fine dining, so what do you suggest?
Wrench Wang: Let's put our backs into it! Once we're through with this, we can finally eat!
Wrench Wang: Since when do storytellers ever talk about recipes? I've never heard them do that before...
Wrench Wang: Sounds good to me, let's get that one then.
(Dialogue ends)
Zhihua: Alright, put me down for Lotus Flower Crisp, please.
(Dialogue ends)
Zhihua: As soon as I'm finished with work, I'll go release Xiao Lanterns with Qiming...
Zhihua: But, I'm planning to invite Qiming to release Xiao Lanterns later, so I'd prefer something without fish or meat, and something with a strong flavor...
Zhihua: Do you have any recommendations?
Zhihua: Grilled Tiger Fish is good and all... But the flavor is a little too strong for me and I'll smell like grilled fish for the rest of the day...
Zhihua: How about something else... Do you have any other recommendations?
(Return to choices)
Zhihua: I can't wait for some Lotus Flower Crisp...
Zhihua: Maybe something like a light pastry would be best?
Zhihua: Mm, that sounds good. It's nice and light and tastes great. That'll be perfect...
Zhihua: That dish is a little too oily...
Zhihua: You say Chef Mao wants to treat me? How great!
