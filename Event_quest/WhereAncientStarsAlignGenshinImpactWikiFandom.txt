 (Leonard, is your wish now fulfilled?)
 A climber, determined to reach the highest peak.
 Come on Paimon, let's go.
 Destroy the meteorite core
 Determination so strong, he wished to pass it on to others.
 Don't give up. Let's see what Mona says.
 Everyone can stand on top of the mountain.
 Fischl, are you leaving?
 Have you just woken up?
 How did you find this place?
 How will we find it?
 I wish everyone a speedy recovery.
 It's quite incoherent as there is lots missing.
 Library Index
 Mona, thank you ever so much for all of your assistance.
 Mona, you are a force to be reckoned with.
 Quest DescriptionThe meteorites that have rained down were once, in fact, part of someone's constellation. Why did this ancient array of stars fall from the sky? What goal were their extinguished flames chasing? Armed with the courage to face the answers, you march onward.
 She has a wild imagination.
 She's full of weird and wonderful thoughts.
 Should we... destroy it?
 Thank you Oz, and thank you Fischl.
 Wait! What are you trying to achieve?
 What is it?
Leonard: Against the unknown, humanity stands as one.
Leonard: But between us and your children, students, and friends, I believe someone will reach that place at last.
Leonard: By age 40, I had conquered every last domain
Leonard: Humans create tools to conquer nature, and when nature conquers them in return, they create better tools.
Leonard: I have little time remaining, though the wind has not yet come for my soul.
Leonard: It fills me with fear... and when an adventurer loses courage, they can no longer climb mountains.
Leonard: It is a beast without weakness, the merciless face of the world.
Leonard: Many times I have sat and stared up at that peak as the boundless snow slowly engulfed me.
Leonard: My dear friend, I leave you my designs for the "Wings of Incompletion".
Leonard: My mountaineering days may be over, but I have a greater ambition now.
Leonard: Now, I am approaching the end of my life.
Leonard: Pilos Peak alone defeated me... as an adventurer, and well, maybe in other ways too.
Leonard: To be alive is to seek, to set foot in every place that the eye can see.
Leonard: Where our legs cannot take us, maybe our tools can. And when tools fail us, perhaps wings can carry us instead.
Leonard: With boats, we can sail the seas.
Leonard: With ropes, we can scale mountains.
Media:Vo eqast004 11 mona 01.ogg Mona: Wow. Well, that was unexpected...
Media:vo eqast004 1 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: My loyal servants, one must bid you adieu till such time as I beckon you once more. Though we have faced many trials and tribulations together, you have all shown commendable courage in the course of duty. I feel a breeze now blows upon this place... and I feel that it blows in your honor.
Media:vo eqast004 1 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: ...Goodbye, (Traveler).
Media:vo eqast004 1 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: You are a good listener. ...I enjoy chatting with you.
Media:vo eqast004 1 fischl 04.ogg Fischl: To be honest, most of the other adventurers in the Guild only ever talk to me when they wanna hear Oz's reconnaissance reports...
Media:vo eqast004 1 fischl 05.ogg Fischl: This little journey we had... it was a great adventure. I'm just sorry that it has to end so abruptly...
Media:vo eqast004 1 fischl 06.ogg Fischl: !!!
Media:vo eqast004 1 fischl 07.ogg Fischl: (Yikes!!! What am I doing? I totally broke form...)
Media:vo eqast004 1 fischl 08.ogg Fischl: Ahem! Most indeed... My dear attendants, I hereby charge the Ritter der Verurteilung with leading you out from the darkness, back into the realm of light.
Media:vo eqast004 1 mona 01.ogg Mona: Who are you calling your "attendant..."
Media:vo eqast004 1 mona 02.ogg Mona: Well, now we're two people short.
Media:vo eqast004 1 mona 03.ogg Mona: But let's not get hung up about that. The good news is, I've found something else out.
Media:vo eqast004 1 mona 04.ogg Mona: I shaved some dust off the meteorite and used it to do another reading. It was actually really effective!
Media:vo eqast004 1 mona 05.ogg Mona: These rocks have been around for hundreds, maybe even thousands of years. Leonard must have lived a very long time ago.
Media:vo eqast004 1 mona 06.ogg Mona: The meteorites carry his will, and can pass it on others. In other words, centuries on from Leonard's life, and the strength of his will has not diminished one bit.
Media:vo eqast004 1 mona 07.ogg Mona: A guy from the distant past with a burning ambition to scale the highest mountain... I'd be willing to bet that he was an adventurer, just like you.
Media:vo eqast004 1 mona 08.ogg Mona: Our approach so far has been too passive, and time has been against us every step of the way. We need to change our strategy, and we need to attack this problem at its source.
Media:vo eqast004 1 mona 09.ogg Mona: Yes... Because if the meteorites carry Leonard's will with them, then it's precisely as Fischl said: the rocks are, in a sense, a curse...
Media:vo eqast004 1 mona 10.ogg Mona: I'm a little incredulous, but it turns out her blind guess was actually spot on... Ugh, no, I'm a respectable astrologist, and I shouldn't stoop to that kind of criticism.
Media:vo eqast004 1 mona 11.ogg Mona: Anyway. All we need to do now is remove the curse.
Media:vo eqast004 1 oz 01.ogg Oz: The time has finally come. Though it brings mein Fräulein no joy to do so, there is something she must announce to the assembled populous.
Media:vo eqast004 1 oz 02.ogg Oz: With the arrival of this giant meteorite, many more people have succumbed to the slumber. Strong as the soldiers may be, they are struggling to cope, and there is demand for volunteers everywhere we turn.
Media:vo eqast004 1 oz 03.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein and I shall tend to the victims on the soldiers' behalf. The rest of this investigation we place in your capable hands.
Media:vo eqast004 1 oz 04.ogg Oz: What mein Fräulein means to say, is... is... is that the mystical mysteries that vex and perplex are bound to be effortlessly extinguished by the advent of your commendable courage and wondrous wisdom.
Media:vo eqast004 1 oz 05.ogg Oz: Ahem... Mein Fräulein simply wishes to say that she has every confidence that you will arrive at the truth of this matter.
Media:vo eqast004 1 oz 06.ogg Oz: We will meet again. Once this matter is concluded, I propose that we all get a drink together.
(Oz and Fischl leave the scene)
Media:vo eqast004 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? Is Fischl waiting for us?
Media:vo eqast004 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whaaaat? You're just gonna bail on us!?
Media:vo eqast004 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh? You're talking a little weirder than you normally do...
Media:vo eqast004 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Uh... And now Oz's translation is the one that sounds all kooky.
Media:vo eqast004 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: An adventurer? That does explain his obsession with mountain climbing!
Media:vo eqast004 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Paimon agrees! From now on, we need to put Leonard at the center of everything we do.
Media:vo eqast004 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Okie-dokie!
Media:vo eqast004 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Since we've got a historical adventurer on our hands, Paimon thinks we should pay a visit to the Adventurers' Guild.
Media:vo eqast004 11 mona 02.ogg Mona: Who would have thought that human will can survive in the skies for millennia on end...
Media:vo eqast004 11 mona 03.ogg Mona: Astrology really is an incredible thing!
Media:vo eqast004 11 mona 04.ogg Mona: The ability to communicate with the stars can give you access to all the secrets from throughout human history... Though of course, very few astrologists ever reach that level.
Media:vo eqast004 11 mona 05.ogg Mona: Uh... What's with the formal tone all of a sudden?
Media:vo eqast004 11 mona 06.ogg Mona: And speaking of formal tone... What is the deal with that girl, Fischl? She's a curious one.
Media:vo eqast004 11 mona 07.ogg Mona: You may well be right.
Media:vo eqast004 11 mona 08.ogg Mona: A mountain of yesteryear now sits as an island in the sea. Almost anyone from Mondstadt could reach it now, just by jumping in a boat.
Media:vo eqast004 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: ...What makes you say that?
Media:vo eqast004 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon thinks so, too! She's soooo... How to put this...
Media:vo eqast004 11 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yeah... Although, if you think about it... Seems she was right all along.
Media:vo eqast004 11 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Is she one of these people who uses the wrong method but still gets the right answer?
Media:vo eqast004 11 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Even so, Paimon thinks that the most surprising thing of all was how Pilos Peak turned into a teeny-tiny little island!
Media:vo eqast004 11 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: In other words, everyone can climb Pilos Peak now.
Media:vo eqast004 11 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: D'you think Leonard would be happy about it? The situation with Pilos Peak might be a bit of a shock... but now, with the help of the Anemo Archon, the people of Mondstadt are able to glide.
Media:vo eqast004 11 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: With wings, people can travel further and higher than ever beforem and explore new and unknown places.
Media:vo eqast004 11 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: The victims should finally start waking up now that we've dealt with the core.
Media:vo eqast004 11 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: And we have finally finished our commission from the Adventurers' Guilds!
Media:vo eqast004 2 katheryne 01.ogg Katheryne: Our records show that there have been many adventurers by that name over the years, it is impossible to know which one you refer to.
Media:vo eqast004 2 katheryne 02.ogg Katheryne: However, I do recall that there is a book in the library authored by someone called Leonard. Perhaps you should take a look?
Media:vo eqast004 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Author, Leonard... Where are you, Leonard... Aha! Gotcha!
Media:vo eqast004 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: The index says that Leonard's book should be in the north-west corner on the top floor of the library.
Media:vo eqast004 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: North-west corner... Should be right over there.
Media:vo eqast004 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Found it! "Of Mountains and Seas", A Guide for Adventurers, written by Leonard!
Media:vo eqast004 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: But the words have faded and there are even pages missing... Paimon's got no hope of reading this.
Media:vo eqast004 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Darn... Maybe we're just wasting our time on this one?
Media:vo eqast004 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, right, yeah! Mona! She might have a better idea.
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 01.ogg Mona: Ooh! Let me see!
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 02.ogg Mona: Hm! I could have predicted as much...
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 03.ogg Mona: Your average astrologist would definitely give up at this point.
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 04.ogg Mona: But I am Mona, progenitor of the future of astrology. Nothing can stand in my way.
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 05.ogg Mona: I simply need to deduce the missing portions with my astrolabe, write them in, and then decipher the text...
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 06.ogg Mona: Phew! Finished at last...
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 07.ogg Mona: Just as I thought, Leonard was an adventurer who lived two thousand years ago.
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 08.ogg Mona: His lifelong dream was to reach the summit of a mountain called Pilos Peak.
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 09.ogg Mona: Somehow, for some reason, this constellation was summoned down from the sky. I suspect that the Fatui have something to do with that part.
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 10.ogg Mona: The meteorites harbor elemental energy, which radiates out and lulls people to sleep by some means akin to hypnosis.
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 11.ogg Mona: And if I'm guessing correctly, there should be some sort of core meteorite among the bunch, within which is a crystal that harbors Leonard's spirit.
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 12.ogg Mona: Well, if I were Leonard, I would want to make sure the core lands right on the snowy summit that I never made it to while I was alive.
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 13.ogg Mona: It's the first I'd heard of it too, so I compared the map from the book against the current topography of Mondstadt. Apparently, Pilos Peak no longer exists.
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 14.ogg Mona: I once read somewhere that the Anemo Archon, Barbatos, once used his divine power to mobilize the winds and blow the ice and snow from the face of the earth. The whole landscape of Mondstadt was changed in the process.
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 15.ogg Mona: The mountains of that age were replaced by the vast stretch of ocean we see today. Still, a mountain that high? Drop it into the ocean and it'll still leave a trace.
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 16.ogg Mona: The summit still reaches just above the water's surface. So, the place known as Pilos Peak in Leonard's day is today known...
Media:vo eqast004 6 mona 17.ogg Mona: ...as "Musk Reef."
Media:vo eqast004 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Look what we found, Leonard wrote a book!
Media:vo eqast004 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So what does it say?
Media:vo eqast004 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Two thousand years? So the constellation that caused the meteorites is from two thousand years ago!?
Media:vo eqast004 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Paimon thinks so too. Whenever something shady happens, you can bet the Fatui are involved.
Media:vo eqast004 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So the core should be at the top of Pilos Peak? Where is that? Paimon's never heard of it before.
Media:vo eqast004 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Are you trying to say that the tallest mountain Paimon's never heard of just... disappeared!?
Media:vo eqast004 9 mona 01.ogg Mona: Ho? So this is Pilos Peak? Not much to show for itself now, eh?
Media:vo eqast004 9 mona 02.ogg Mona: He managed to extricate himself from the dream on his own strength? How is that possible?
Media:vo eqast004 9 mona 03.ogg Mona: You entered the dream they've all been having, didn't you? How much do you know about Leonard?
Media:vo eqast004 9 mona 04.ogg Mona: The stars are a lie? What are you talking about?
Media:vo eqast004 9 mona 05.ogg Mona: A few moments ago? You mean...
Media:vo eqast004 9 mona 06.ogg Mona: Ugh, can you believe that guy? He calls us suckers, and then he just trots off!
Media:vo eqast004 9 mona 07.ogg Mona: No one disrespects me, no one! Agh! Time to show them what you get when you cross world-class genius with pure, unadulterated rage!
Media:vo eqast004 9 mona 08.ogg Mona: Told you! That's what happens when you disrespect me!
Media:vo eqast004 9 mona 09.ogg Mona: You bet I am! Paimon, you agree too, right? Did I show those Fatui who's boss or what?
Media:vo eqast004 9 mona 10.ogg Mona: See! How do you like that, Harbinger! Scumbag...
Media:vo eqast004 9 mona 11.ogg Mona: He seemed genuinely shaken, though. I don't think he was lying. I was always taught to talk about the "false sky" during astrological readings... Could there be more to such phrases than I have been led to believe?
Media:vo eqast004 9 mona 12.ogg Mona: ...Ahem. I digress. Come on, let's finish the job we came to do.
Media:vo eqast004 9 mona 13.ogg Mona: This stone harbors an unbelievable amount of elemental energy, and human desire. It's the core alright.
Media:vo eqast004 9 mona 14.ogg Mona: Yes. Otherwise, the victims will never wake up... This core is the root cause of everything that has happened.
Media:vo eqast004 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Looks like someone beat us here.. Is this, like, a popular tourist spot, or...
Media:vo eqast004 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ah! It's you!
Media:vo eqast004 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Look at the state he's in... Was he in that dream just now?
Media:vo eqast004 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: We knew it! This was all a dirty trick by the Fatui!
Media:vo eqast004 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: What?
Media:vo eqast004 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Is this some kind of astrological debate between you and Mona? Because if so, surely you can come up with a better argument than "The stars are a lie."
Media:vo eqast004 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Seriously, who's gonna fall for that one when you can just lift your head up at night and see them up there, twinkling away?
Media:vo eqast004 9 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Wow, you fought so fiercely!
Media:vo eqast004 9 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Sure did! Without you here, those guys would have caused us a whole lot more trouble!
Media:vo eqast004 9 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: The core has gotta be round here somewhere!
Media:vo eqast004 9 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Whoa, this must be the core... It looks totally different from all the other meteorites! It's way more... shiny.
Media:vo eqast004 9 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Do it, (Traveler)!
Media:vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 01.ogg Scaramouche: Ugh... Huh? You again?
Media:vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 02.ogg Scaramouche: Hah! Just because you are powerless to do something does not mean that I am.
Media:vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 03.ogg Scaramouche: You're too late, anyway. I've finished my research.
Media:vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 04.ogg Scaramouche: Save it. No more fun and games for me today. I'll come for you when I'm good and ready.
Media:vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 05.ogg Scaramouche: Leonard? Who's Leonard? ...Ugh, whatever! I have bigger fish to fry!
Media:vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 06.ogg Scaramouche: I've discovered something far more important... and far more terrifying.
Media:vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 07.ogg Scaramouche: The stars, the sky... It's all a gigantic hoax. A lie.
Media:vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 08.ogg Scaramouche: Hah... Hahahahaha! Oh, you are so naive, it kills me!
Media:vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 09.ogg Scaramouche: Still... Can't really blame you. After all, I used to believe the same thing myself — up until a few moments ago, that is...
Media:vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 10.ogg Scaramouche: Look — I really don't have the time to do this right now.
Media:vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 11.ogg Scaramouche: What was the Jester thinking? He must have had some inkling of what we might discover on this mission... Would it really have been so difficult to give me a little forewarning? Hmph, or maybe he just wanted to give me a fright...
Media:vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 12.ogg Scaramouche: Time for me to go out and find the truth. So long, suckers!
Mona studies the book intently...
