 "Immernachtreich..."? Never heard of that place before.
 (A curse? Could it really be?)
 ...Shall we check in with the villagers, then?
 Are there any other symptoms besides the deep sleep?
 Did he touch the meteorite?
 Did you say... "a world beyond"?
 I will surely do my part.
 Katheryne, is that the same thing you were talking about?
 Please lead the way, O fair Princess.
 Quest DescriptionKatheryne of the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild seems to have something to tell you.You hear from Katheryne of the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild that meteorites of unknown origin have turned the lives of people across the land upside down. As a Guild member, you boldly step up to the plate and begin to seek out the truth.
 Shouldn't the source of the energy also respond in like fashion?
 So he works in the wine business?
 So many people have fainted.
 Thanks for the info! I'd better hop to it~
 The meteorite is just over there.
 Then everyone else will wake up, too!
 With a Vision, can you trace the elemental energy back to its source?
 Yes, Paimon...
Adler: Please keep a safe distance from the meteorites. Only approach the impact site if you have business concerning the meteorites.
Check Victim: The victim is still deep in sleep.
Edna: May the Anemo Archon spare you from the effects of the meteorites.
Hartman: Thank you all! I must get back to the Winery and let everyone know that I'm safe.
Joyce: Please exercise extreme caution. Do not touch the meteorites with your bare hands.
Katheryne: ...A power that sends any who touch them into a deep sleep
Katheryne: Covering the entire countryside of Mondstadt and Liyue
Katheryne: The Guild believes the meteorites to be highly dangerous
(Cutscene ends)
Katheryne: The meteorites seem to harbor a strange power...
Katheryne: The strike zone was very large
Katheryne: There was a meteor shower last night
Media:vo eqast001 1 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Katheryne! Vassal of the Immernachtreich, do mine ears deceive me, or didst thou cry out mine holy name in earnest supplication not one moment ago?
Media:vo eqast001 1 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: My loyal subjects, I see your faces are filled with fear and trepidation at the vile and villainous evils that once again seek, albeit in vain, to disturb the peace and tranquility of our beloved Mondstadt.
Media:vo eqast001 1 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: Oh? You are the Traveler? Hmm... One finds the look in your eyes to be most agreeable.
Media:vo eqast001 1 fischl 04.ogg Fischl: Traveler, do you also mean to confront these cryptic crystals of darkness and doom?
Media:vo eqast001 1 fischl 05.ogg Fischl: Hm. Very well then. You have always been a pious vassal, Katheryne, and thus I shall acquiesce to your heartfelt plea for mine assistance.
Media:vo eqast001 1 fischl 06.ogg Fischl: Rejoice! For to join the Prinzessin der Verurteilung on her majestic mission for but a fleeting moment is surely cause for an eternity of elation!
Media:vo eqast001 1 fischl 07.ogg Fischl: Hmph, blind to the glory of the Immernachtreich, realm of everlasting night... Though, one could hardly expect more from a lowly traveler... Hence, it is not blasphemy, but ignorance, that be the cause of this transgression. One will therefore show clemency.
Media:vo eqast001 1 fischl 08.ogg Fischl: Ring the bells, sound the trumpets, for the day of judgment is upon us! Rejoice, all ye who cry out for salvation, for the Prinzessin der Verurteilung has come!
Media:vo eqast001 1 katheryne 01.ogg Katheryne: Hello, Traveler. You couldn't have come at a better time.
Media:vo eqast001 1 katheryne 02.ogg Katheryne: I'm afraid so. It's quite serious... We need all the help from our adventurers that we can get.
Media:vo eqast001 1 katheryne 03.ogg Katheryne: So, I have an extremely urgent commission for you, Traveler.
(Cutscene plays)
Media:vo eqast001 1 katheryne 04.ogg Katheryne: Truth be told, we have never encountered anything like this before.
Media:vo eqast001 1 katheryne 05.ogg Katheryne: The Adventurers' Guild is currently stretched beyond capacity. We are relying on our members across the land to rally together and support the relief effort at this trying time.
Media:vo eqast001 1 katheryne 06.ogg Katheryne: One moment, safety must come first...
Media:vo eqast001 1 katheryne 07.ogg Katheryne: Ah, you've arrived.
Media:vo eqast001 1 katheryne 08.ogg Katheryne: Traveler, allow me to introduce Miss Fischl, a senior member of the Adventurers' Guild.
Media:vo eqast001 1 katheryne 09.ogg Katheryne: Fischl, Oz, this is the Traveler of whom I have spoken to you previously.
Media:vo eqast001 1 katheryne 10.ogg Katheryne: The Adventurers' Guild has so far been unable to ascertain the cause of the meteor shower, or the precise side effects of the meteorites. Hence, we recommend that adventurers travel in pairs for safety.
Media:vo eqast001 1 katheryne 11.ogg Katheryne: Traveler, Fischl, please look out for one another on your journey, and exercise extreme caution at all times.
Media:vo eqast001 1 katheryne 12.ogg Katheryne: In time, you will understand... The more time you spend with Miss Fischl, the clearer everything will become...
Media:vo eqast001 1 oz 01.ogg Oz: A pleasure to meet you again, Katheryne.
Media:vo eqast001 1 oz 02.ogg Oz: Haha, nice to meet you too, my friend... Though I'm sure you must have seen phenomena far stranger than myself before?
Media:vo eqast001 1 oz 03.ogg Oz: Honorary Knight of the Knights of Favonius, and travel companion Paimon, we are honored to meet you both. We have heard much about you.
Media:vo eqast001 1 oz 04.ogg Oz: I believe that mein Fräulein does indeed refer to the meteorite strike.
Media:vo eqast001 1 oz 05.ogg Oz: This young lady is my master, Princess Fischl. She hails from a world beyond known as Immernachtreich. I am mein Fräulein's humble familiar, Oz the Raven.
Media:vo eqast001 1 oz 06.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein means to say: "Hello."
Media:vo eqast001 1 oz 07.ogg Oz: I am sure that you must have many questions. Perhaps we can walk — or indeed fly — and talk.
Media:vo eqast001 1 oz 08.ogg Oz: The situation looks even worse than we imagined.
Media:vo eqast001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What do you mean? Has something bad happened?
Media:vo eqast001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whoa... That does sound pretty serious...
Media:vo eqast001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ah! Did that raven just speak!?
Media:vo eqast001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Uh... Cry—Crystic cryptals of... doomness and... What?
Media:vo eqast001 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Wow... That all sounds very impressive...
Media:vo eqast001 1 paimon 06a.ogg Media:vo eqast001 1 paimon 06b.ogg Paimon:  My name's Paimon, and (Traveler)'s a traveler. We look forward to working with you!
Media:vo eqast001 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Clemency?
Media:vo eqast001 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: These guys are the weirdest double act Paimon's ever seen... The girl sounds strange enough as it is, but every time her pet bird talks, it gets even weirder...
Media:vo eqast001 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Oh, and that's another thing... What's all this about traveling in pairs? This is clearly a party of four!
Media:vo eqast001 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: We're in Springvale now. Katheryne said that this is the closest impact site to the city.
Media:vo eqast001 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: This princess lady seems really enthusiastic.
Media:vo eqast001 10 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Verily, I say, these meteorites are surely the source of the nefarious nightmares that assail my subjects! This I swear on my very sovereignty.
Media:vo eqast001 10 oz 01.ogg Oz: I believe we have found something.
Media:vo eqast001 10 oz 02.ogg Oz: The question is, are these shards of meteorite, which are infused with elemental energy, the true source of the calamity, or not?
Media:vo eqast001 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: That seems to be the last of them. Do you think getting rid of them will help make things better for the Springvale villagers?
Media:vo eqast001 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yeah, let's do that!
Media:vo eqast001 12 edna 01.ogg Edna: Bless you! Thanks to your efforts, two of the victims have already awoken.
Media:vo eqast001 12 edna 02.ogg Edna: I do hope you are able to dispose of the rest of the meteorites around the village...
Media:vo eqast001 12 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Haha, it is most gladdening, indeed. Yet the news that I would be attending to this matter in person was surely the only guarantee that my faithful subjects ever needed of a felicitous outcome!
Media:vo eqast001 12 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: Then thou wert surely cursed, I say! O, wretched scourge upon this land...
Media:vo eqast001 12 hartman 01.ogg Hartman: Ugh... I'm so sleepy... *yawn*
Media:vo eqast001 12 hartman 02.ogg Hartman: All I remember is that it was cold... I was walking along a mountain path... In the ice and snow, I think...
Media:vo eqast001 12 hartman 03.ogg Hartman: Ah, I really don't know... In my dream, it felt like... I wasn't in full control of my actions.
Media:vo eqast001 12 oz 01.ogg Oz: This is wonderful news, it gladdens the heart.
Media:vo eqast001 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Edna! We got rid of the meteorite up on the hill behind the village. How are the victims doing now? Any better?
Media:vo eqast001 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Great, so it did work!
Media:vo eqast001 12 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hey, you just woke up, right? What were you dreaming about while you were asleep?
Media:vo eqast001 12 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: So... Just hiking in the mountains? Or were you supposed to have a destination?
Media:vo eqast001 12 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Well, whatever the case, what we do know is that getting rid of the meteorite shards is helping. So, c'mon guys, we need to redouble our efforts!
Media:vo eqast001 4 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Dear mortals, in this dark hour, your Prinzessin permits you to forgo the usual etiquette and simply relay your account of the matter at hand forthrightly.
Media:vo eqast001 4 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: What ridiculous remonstration is this? Is one not under the divine protection of one's Edelstein der Dunkelheit, and thus impervious to the trifling threat posed by this petty piece of black crystal?
Media:vo eqast001 4 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: Is that so... Very well then, one shall proceed as advised.
Media:vo eqast001 4 fischl 04.ogg Fischl: You dare to parrot the parlance of the Prinzessin!? Hmph! What could one hope to comprehend of the lamenting of a thousand dying world with the sagacity of a mere mortal?
Media:vo eqast001 4 fischl 05.ogg Fischl: Perhaps it is better that you remain in blissful ignorance, for the burden of fate borne by the Prinzessin der Verurteilung would surely be too much for thy shoulders.
Media:vo eqast001 4 joyce 01.ogg Joyce: ...Excuse me? Who are you?
Media:vo eqast001 4 joyce 02.ogg Joyce: Oh, I see. Well, last night, this fellow touched the meteorite and then she fainted just moments later.
Media:vo eqast001 4 joyce 03.ogg Joyce: So, however you plan to conduct your investigation, I implore you: Do not, under any circumstances, touch the meteorites with your bare hands.
Media:vo eqast001 4 oz 01.ogg Oz: We come in peace, good sir. We were just hoping that you could reveal whatever you know about this poor victim's situation.
Media:vo eqast001 4 oz 02.ogg Oz: On the Contrary, mein Fräulein, wise is the princess who is receptive to the sound advice offered by her subjects.
Media:vo eqast001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wait, wait! Stop, let Paimon explain... We're from the Adventurers' Guild. They commissioned us to and investigate after the meteor shower.
Media:vo eqast001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: That goes for you, too, (Traveler)! Wise is the adventurer who is receptive to the sound advice offered by smart people!
Media:vo eqast001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ehehehe, Paimon never gets to talk like that! Oh, Paimon could get used to it, though...
Media:vo eqast001 5 adler 01.ogg Adler: Um... He— He's been sleeping all day and shows no signs of waking up.
Media:vo eqast001 5 adler 02a.ogg Adler: He did. And now he's fast asleep, occasionally he also sleep-talks.
Media:vo eqast001 5 adler 02b.ogg Adler: Not that I've seen so far, although occasionally he talks in his sleep.
Media:vo eqast001 5 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Pray tell, O Knight, what tragedy befell this unfortunate subject of mine?
Media:vo eqast001 5 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: His dark dream harbors a forbidden fruit, poised between the jaws of a ferocious beast... Woe betide the weak should they peer into its eyes, as black as a moonless midnight, for they shall surely be lured into the abyss...
Media:vo eqast001 5 oz 01.ogg Oz: Though we have no evidence to prove it, mein Fräulein's intuition has never failed her before.
Media:vo eqast001 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Look, another victim!
Media:vo eqast001 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wh-What's going on? Why is he saying that?
Media:vo eqast001 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Do you mean... There's something luring him in his dream?
Media:vo eqast001 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Well, let's keep investigating anyway!
Media:vo eqast001 5 patientsa 01.ogg Unconscious Victim: Can't go on... n-need to rest...
Media:vo eqast001 6 draff 01.ogg Draff: Sorry to interrupt you, folks — do you have a moment to spare?
Media:vo eqast001 6 draff 02.ogg Draff: It's... I-I can hardly get the words out...
Media:vo eqast001 6 draff 03.ogg Draff: One of the meteorites struck the hill behind our village. Allan told everyone he was going to go see it for himself... And then, sure enough, he just ran off.
Media:vo eqast001 6 draff 04.ogg Draff: You've seen how dangerous these confounded meteorites are. I'm afraid something may have happened to him... Could you come with me to find him and bring him back?
Media:vo eqast001 6 draff 05.ogg Draff: Exactly! Once we get that rascal back safely, he's due for the scolding of a lifetime, if you ask me!
Media:vo eqast001 6 edna 01.ogg Edna: Greetings, I am Sister Edna. I am here to nurse the sick.
Media:vo eqast001 6 edna 02.ogg Edna: I believe he said something about having to get back to work...
Media:vo eqast001 6 edna 03.ogg Edna: I have tried. He awoke once, for a brief moment, but quickly lapsed back into sleep.
Media:vo eqast001 6 edna 04.ogg Edna: He said he dreamed he was on top of a mountain, and it was very cold there.
Media:vo eqast001 6 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: State your name at once, you heinous heathen of nefarious nightmares!
Media:vo eqast001 6 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: This is no ordinary dream... This man... he has been cursed!
Media:vo eqast001 6 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: This has the trappings of a cruel, cold curse by a mountain-dwelling demon... Alas! One fears these demons have descended from their icy peaks and now covet the domain of the spring fairy!
Media:vo eqast001 6 fischl 04.ogg Fischl: This is a most grave state of affairs... But fear not, for damnation is mine to dispense—
Media:vo eqast001 6 hartman 01.ogg Hartman: The wine... The wine...
Media:vo eqast001 6 oz 01.ogg Oz: My apologies, mein Fräulein was not addressing you... This man lying on the ground — has he spoken at all?
Media:vo eqast001 6 oz 02.ogg Oz: He seems to be sleeping deeply indeed.
Media:vo eqast001 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Can't you just wake him up?
Media:vo eqast001 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Um... Did he tell you anything while he was awake?
Media:vo eqast001 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Mountain, cold... Hmm...
Media:vo eqast001 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, hey, Draff! What's the matter?
Media:vo eqast001 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Wait, so... Big blazing rocks fall out of the sky, and all Allen's worried about is missing out on the action!?
Media:vo eqast001 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Paimon could not agree more! Let's go find that rascal and drag him back by the ears!
Media:vo eqast001 8 allan 01.ogg Allan: Help me!
Media:vo eqast001 8 draff 01.ogg Draff: Allan! What in the devil are you doing!?
Media:vo eqast001 8 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: The hour of judgement has come! The threads of your fate lie in my hands!
(During combat)
Media:vo eqast001 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: That's him!
Media:vo eqast001 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: These slimes are so vicious! Do you think it has to do with the meteorite?
Media:vo eqast001 9 allan 01.ogg Allan: Phew! I thought I was going to die here...
Media:vo eqast001 9 allan 02.ogg Allan: I-I'm sorry! I'll never do it again!
Media:vo eqast001 9 draff 01.ogg Draff: You fool! What were you thinking, gallivanting off on your own at a time like this!?
Media:vo eqast001 9 draff 02.ogg Draff: I sincerely apologize for the trouble Allan has caused for you all. I will make absolutely sure that he learns his lesson!
Media:vo eqast001 9 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Oh? Could it be, perchance, that mine Edelstein der Dunkelheit portends the certain demise of this unholy hex of cold?
Media:vo eqast001 9 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: The profoundest of enigmas... the whispered secrets of the stars... unholy hexes of demon bones... and—
Media:vo eqast001 9 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: Ahem, thank you, Oz. Those whose minds are muddled by the mundane matters of this woeful world are unable to fathom my noble intent as swiftly as thou art...
Media:vo eqast001 9 oz 01.ogg Oz: Our apologies, mein Fräulein is not well-versed in the parlance of the common folk.
Media:vo eqast001 9 oz 02.ogg Oz: I fear you misunderstand — I am no translator, but a humble conveyor of mein Fräulein's royal will. I would venture that what her Vision is reacting to in this vicinity is, quite simply, elemental energy.
Media:vo eqast001 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yeah, next time you think about doing something stupid, think again!
Media:vo eqast001 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon's gonna take a closer loo- Huh? Princess, your Vision is flashing!
Media:vo eqast001 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Maybe...? What kind of things does your Vision react to, exactly?
Media:vo eqast001 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Whaaat? Why do you have to talk so funny all the time, Paimon doesn't understand!
Media:vo eqast001 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oooh, so that's what you're for? To translate?
Media:vo eqast001 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: So, there's elemental energy in the meteorite? And your Vision flashes in response to it?
Media:vo eqast001 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Paimon thinks... probably yes? Anyway, no harm in giving it a try! Let's look for shards of meteorite using Fischl's Vision — clearing them away will help make the area less dangerous.
Recuperated Victim: Huh...? W-Was I asleep? ...Gosh, how long was I out?
