Hu Tao – Fragrance in Thaw
Liyue's Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is a very old name in the funerary business, and its directorship is now up to its 77th generation, with the current Director being a young lady named Hu Tao.
This young director is known for her sharp intellect, but in some peoples' eyes, Hu Tao might be a little too smart for her own good.
Indeed, the quirky and eccentric Hu Tao is not what people expect from a solemn title like that of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's director.
However, Hu Tao has a unique outlook on life and death, and though she is surrounded by death every day, her optimistic outlook has never changed. Quite an odd duck, this one.

Xiangling – Exquisite Delicacy
Liyue Harbor is home to Wanmin Restaurant, and Wanmin Restaurant is home to Xiangling, the famous chef.
The spicy dishes she makes are famous far and wide, and are considered the best of the best.
However, she is not just a chef of great skill, but also one with a great passion for cooking.
She always insists on going out into the wild herself to search for natural ingredients, and is thus often absent from the restaurant.
 ...Are you alright?
Media:vo eqhdj talk 5 xiangling 03a.ogg Xiangling: Could be worse, could be worse! Festivals are always a little busy, you know how it is.
 Classic Liyue...
 Did you try asking Ganyu?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 08b 1.ogg Keqing: Unfortunately, Ganyu is on leave at the moment, so I'm unable to get in touch with her.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 08b 2.ogg Keqing: I'm afraid I'll still require your assistance.
 Erm, what are you doing here, Keqing?
 Great, then we go watch the fireworks together!
 He's really knowledgeable about the people of Liyue.
 How's Guoba these days?
Media:vo eqhdj talk 5 xiangling 03b.ogg Xiangling: Hehe, aw, thanks for asking! Well, neither the stove nor the atmosphere are dying down any time soon, so Guoba's as happy as can be.
 Huh? Me?
 I miss it all the time.
Media:vo eqhdj talk 1 ningguang 03a.ogg Ningguang: Is that so? I am delighted to hear it.
 I'll think of something.
 Is there any way we can help her?
 Just came here to see you.
 Just here to chat with you.
 Keqing definitely had an imposing presence...
 Let's go speak with others who are familiar with Keqing.
 Let's go talk to Zhongli, then.
 My focus is on my mission, my journey.
Media:vo eqhdj talk 1 ningguang 03b.ogg Ningguang: Ah, naturally.
 No, no, not at all.
 Not bad, we've learned a lot along the way.
 Quest DescriptionLantern Rite has come around again. You and Paimon go and ask the people of Liyue about this year's festival preparations.
 So she must feel... very tired?
 Step DescriptionLantern Rite has come around again. You and Paimon go and ask the people of Liyue about this year's festival preparations. At Ningguang's request, you start looking for ways to convince Keqing to set her work down for a while.
 Sure, leave it to me.
 Sure, no problem.
 Thank you, but we're here to see Mr. Zhongli.
 We'll gladly help you.
 We're looking for your consultant, Zhongli.
 We're not disturbing you, are we?
 Well, long story short...
 What are you working on, Keqing?
However, Hu Tao has a unique outlook on life and death, and though she is surrounded by death every day, her optimistic outlook has never changed. Quite an odd duck, this one.
However, she is not just a chef of great skill, but also one with a great passion for cooking.

Media:vo dialog eqhdj101 ferrylady 01.ogg Ferrylady: If you're looking for the director and our consultant, you can go look for them at Third-Round Knockout. I've heard the director often goes there to do... uh, promotion.
Media:vo dialog eqhdj101 zhongli 01.ogg Zhongli: Once you've collected enough story material, we can meet here again and discuss things further.
Media:vo eqhdj talk 1 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Another Lantern Rite is upon us.
Media:vo eqhdj talk 1 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Traveler, it seems Liyue has a way of drawing you back every once in a while. Do you miss it here?
Media:vo eqhdj talk 1 ningguang 03a.ogg Ningguang: Is that so? I am delighted to hear it.
Media:vo eqhdj talk 1 ningguang 03b.ogg Ningguang: Ah, naturally.
Media:vo eqhdj talk 1 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: Times change. Suddenly, the Lantern Rite of today is a wholly different affair from the past.
Media:vo eqhdj talk 1 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: The preparations were very lengthy this time. I don't know if it is to everyone's tastes, but I, for one, am most satisfied with the way it has turned out.
Media:vo eqhdj talk 1 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: I hope that it might be a highlight of your journey. If you ever grow weary in your travels, know that you can always come back and visit Liyue.
Media:vo eqhdj talk 4 hutao 01.ogg Hu Tao: Well hello there, (Traveler)! A happy and healthy Lantern Rite to you!
Media:vo eqhdj talk 4 hutao 02.ogg Hu Tao: And what brings you here on this finest of days? Not business, I presume? So what is it? Need my help?
Media:vo eqhdj talk 4 hutao 03.ogg Hu Tao: Oh, I see! So you just missed me all of a sudden? Oh, you — why'd you have to go and be so thoughtful, hmm? I couldn't possibly bring myself to scare you with a ghost story now!
Media:vo eqhdj talk 4 hutao 04.ogg Hu Tao: To tell the truth, this Lantern Rite's been a busy one for me. I got Xiangling to give me a few recipes and I've been trying my hand at them. Since you're here, why don't you have a taste...
Media:vo eqhdj talk 4 hutao 05.ogg Hu Tao: Wh—What's that look for!? ... You're not leaving already are you? C'mon, don't go — I promise they don't taste that bad! And I promise, it's not a prank!
Media:vo eqhdj talk 5 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: Okay, so we have one group booked for two tables for a banquet tomorrow night... and another group who needs their order delivered around the same time... Phew...
Media:vo eqhdj talk 5 xiangling 02.ogg Xiangling: Oh! Hey, (Traveler)! Happy Lantern Rite!
Media:vo eqhdj talk 5 xiangling 03a.ogg Xiangling: Could be worse, could be worse! Festivals are always a little busy, you know how it is.
Media:vo eqhdj talk 5 xiangling 03b.ogg Xiangling: Hehe, aw, thanks for asking! Well, neither the stove nor the atmosphere are dying down any time soon, so Guoba's as happy as can be.
Media:vo eqhdj talk 5 xiangling 04.ogg Xiangling: If you're craving anything off the Wanmin menu, don't worry about being a burden. However busy it gets, I'll always make time to cook for you.
Media:vo eqhdj101 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Who would've guessed that rebuilding the Jade Chamber would draw out such a massive monster!
Media:vo eqhdj101 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: For a second there, Paimon really thought the Jade Chamber was gonna be ruined again...
Media:vo eqhdj101 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Whew, but it's all over now... who knows if the Lantern Rite can still go on after an incident like that, though.
Media:vo eqhdj101 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Let's ask Lady Ningguang how things are shaping up for the festival this year, (Traveler).
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: ...Send this report to the Ministry of Civil Affairs and have them delegate each of the tasks on the list to the appropriate departments.
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Also, be sure to tell them that though the Lantern Rite may be complicated, everything must be done properly.
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: No, of course not. You are my honored guests.
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: And given the looks of you two, I presume that you are here to celebrate the Lantern Rite?
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: As always, there will be a variety of activities taking place. Oh, but there is one of particular interest... The Ministry of Civil Affairs is planning a fireworks show this year. It should certainly be worth your time.
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: Fireworks were originally developed alongside many other inventions here in Liyue.
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: When our ancestors first created fireworks, they were originally known as "firecrackers." Their bright flashes and loud sounds were often used for warding off beasts or as warning signals to other people.
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: In those days, it was difficult for people to contact one another while out farming the land, so they would carry firecrackers with them to give signals when necessary.
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: But people's lifestyles began to change after Liyue Harbor was founded. They no longer had to travel out of town to tend the fields anymore, so the use of firecrackers for emergencies also began to dwindle.
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: But through our local customs, the pioneering spirit of the firecrackers has been passed down to this very day.
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: We made improvements to firecrackers and began setting them off during the Lantern Rite to commemorate the tenacious spirit of our ancestors.
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: As I am sure you already know, everything on this land accumulates history and value as time passes. That is the nature of Liyue.
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: I've left Keqing in charge of the fireworks show. If you're interested, why don't we pay her a visit together?
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: Releasing Mingxiao Lanterns has always been at the heart of the Lantern Rite, but with all that has occurred in Liyue as of late, I think the people of the city need something to warm their hearts, a feeling of everyone coming together in solidarity.
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: So, I believe that this year calls for a celebration of particular magnificence, something that would be closer to the hearts of every citizen.
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 16.ogg Ningguang: We are currently in the process of placing fireworks at various locations all throughout Liyue. We shall choose a timely moment during the festival to set off all the fireworks in unison, allowing the sparkling lights and excitement to resonate with the hearts of the people.
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hello, Lady Ningguang! It's us again!
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: That's right! So what's on the agenda for the festival this year?
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Fireworks? But we've already seen fireworks in other places before.
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Is there something special about the fireworks in Liyue?
Media:vo eqhdj101 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Wow, everything has so much history in Liyue.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: Hmm, we need to add a few more locations for launching fireworks. The show has to be visible all across Liyue, not just in the city. They celebrate Lantern Rite in Qingce Village too, you know.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 02.ogg Keqing: The budget is exactly what it's meant to be. It's the necessary amount of funds to properly carry out a task.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 03.ogg Keqing: If you think the current budget will not suffice, then we'll simply have to apply for more funding from the Ministry of Civil Affairs and wait for their approval.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 04.ogg Keqing: Our aim is to organize a memorable Lantern Rite. The budget is there just to facilitate planning, we mustn't lose sight of our goal.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 05.ogg Keqing: Good, and please remember, safety first.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 06.ogg Keqing: Oh, it's Ningguang and the Traveler! Good to see you.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 07.ogg Keqing: Are you here for the Lantern Rite? Your timing couldn't be any better, the preparations are almost complete.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 08.ogg Keqing: I'm reviewing the positioning of the fireworks and double-checking the relevant facilities... It's all in a day's work.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 09.ogg Keqing: No, it's fine. Really, I can handle it.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 10.ogg Keqing: Pengyi, please redraft our plans, make a summary report, and send it to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 11.ogg Keqing: I'm going into town to check the progress of the fireworks setup. I'll return shortly.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 12.ogg Keqing: As for you, Traveler, you're our esteemed guest. Please take the opportunity to stay in Liyue Harbor and enjoy the festivities.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 13.ogg Keqing: Pengyi, is everything clear? Please remember the tasks I've given you.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 14.ogg Keqing: Good. Ningguang, Traveler, goodbye for now.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: Forgive my directness, but if I'm not mistaken, you could just as easily leave these tasks to your subordinates. You've already been working around the clock these past few days, I'm sure a break would not be amiss.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: Ever since the adepti left Liyue Harbor in the hands of mortals, we Qixing have taken up the responsibility of leading the people.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: We have taken charge of many vital tasks in various sectors, and we are responsible for planning and organizing all sorts of affairs.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: That said, being in charge of everything inevitably takes its toll. It's exhausting at times.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: Jiangzhou was responsible for planning the Lantern Rite in former years, but her father is getting quite old now, so she transferred to another department this year.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: In the end, the Lantern Rite planning was left to Keqing and myself. I am the head organizer, while Keqing is responsible for the highly anticipated fireworks show.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: Such an important event should be entrusted to the most qualified candidate. Keqing is disciplined, yet passionate about her work, so she's naturally the best fit for the job.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: Absolutely. She is strict with both herself and others, to the point that she can even become overly involved at times. She's worked several days without a break now.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: I'm concerned about the effects it may have in the long run.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: Finding balance is an essential concept in Liyue culture.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: I've tried talking to her, but you know how she is... She uses her wit to talk circles around anyone...
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: Traveler, you are quite close to Keqing, why don't you try talking to her? Maybe she'd listen to someone as experienced as you.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: Thank you, Traveler. I am glad you are able to help. Keqing can be a tough nut to crack, sometimes.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: I still have other business to attend to at the Jade Chamber. I'll leave Keqing in your capable hands.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whew, Paimon couldn't get a single word in just now...
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh, well, more like Paimon didn't dare open her mouth while they were talking, but still!
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Did you notice it too? Lady Keqing is a lot more outspoken than she used to be!
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: And she seems a whole lot busier, too. Wonder why...
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: She's definitely disciplined... no doubt about that.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Uh, are you sure you can really persuade Keqing to take a break? Even Ningguang herself couldn't manage to convince her...
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Besides, before you can persuade someone, you have to at least understand how they feel at the moment.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Keqing has been working non-stop without a break.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Duh! C'mon, everyone knows that! Think harder, how does she feel deep, deep down inside?
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Umm, or maybe... we could ask a friend. You know, someone more knowledgeable about these things?
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Huh? Zhongli?
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Oh, there's no arguing that! Zhongli it is, then!
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Paimon thinks he's still a consultant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Let's go see if he's there!
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 01.ogg Pengyi: B—But Lady Keqing, what about our budget...
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 02.ogg Pengyi: Yes, Lady Keqing. I understand.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 03.ogg Pengyi: Yes, Lady Keqing! Don't worry.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 04.ogg Pengyi: Please excuse me, Lady Ningguang, and uh... Traveler, I must get going.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 05.ogg Pengyi: Lady Keqing told me a great deal of information, and I have to write up the plans from scratch again, so time is of the essence.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 06.ogg Pengyi: Ooh! One moment, I almost forgot!
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 07.ogg Pengyi: Here, Traveler, this is a Launch Tube. Lady Keqing said you may be interested, so she had me keep one to give to you.
Media:vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 08.ogg Pengyi: Someone with good handicraft skills should be able to use this to design their very own fireworks. You should try it when you have the chance!
Media:vo eqhdj101 4 ferrylady 01.ogg Ferrylady: ...
Media:vo eqhdj101 4 ferrylady 02.ogg Ferrylady: Hello, how may I help you?
Media:vo eqhdj101 4 ferrylady 03.ogg Ferrylady: Ah, yes... Well, I'm afraid he is currently out with the director.
Media:vo eqhdj101 4 ferrylady 04.ogg Ferrylady: The director said that they were going for a walk.
Media:vo eqhdj101 4 ferrylady 05.ogg Ferrylady: If you'd prefer, you could go look for them at Third-Round Knockout.
Media:vo eqhdj101 4 ferrylady 06.ogg Ferrylady: I've heard the director often goes there to do... uh, promotion.
Media:vo eqhdj101 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Out with the director? You mean, for work?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 gooba 01.ogg Guoba: ♪~♪~
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 gooba 02.ogg Guoba: ?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 gooba 03.ogg Guoba: ♪!
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 01.ogg Hu Tao: Yum... Whew, I'm so full, not another bite!
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 02.ogg Hu Tao: Hats off to you, Xiangling, serving the grilled fish with a dipping sauce is quite an innovative approach, the flavor is just to die for!
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 03.ogg Hu Tao: Oh! It's the Traveler and Paimon! What brings you to this side of town?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 04.ogg Hu Tao: Hold on! Let me take a wild guess. Hmm, yes... Oh, you must be here for the Lantern Rite!
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 05.ogg Hu Tao: Aiya, c'mon! Can't you take a joke!?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 06.ogg Hu Tao: So, c'mon! Why are you looking for our good consultant? Do enlighten us.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 07.ogg Hu Tao: And just in case you were wondering, we are on business, too! We only tried Xiangling's dish since we just happened to be here.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 08.ogg Hu Tao: Even during the most joyous of holidays, life still follows its natural course, does it not? Is that really so surprising? But there isn't need to be alarmed, it's just a nice day today and I thought we could go for a walk while doing a little promotion for our business.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 09.ogg Hu Tao: You can go ahead and chat away. Xiangling and I will go have some tea with the boss over there. Zhongli, please come get me when you're through here!
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 10.ogg Hu Tao: Oooh! That's quite the compliment, don't you think?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 11.ogg Hu Tao: And I thought I have a way with words, but you certainly take the prize, Mr. Zhongli.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 12.ogg Hu Tao: What's that? Would you like to order something, Guoba? Please, by all means, it's my treat! I'll just open a tab under "Xiangling"!
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: Greetings everyone, I hope I'm not intruding.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 02.ogg Keqing: Mr. Zhongli, I didn't expect to see you here. Thank you for all your assistance during the Rite of Parting.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 03.ogg Keqing: Hmm, why? And what's with your strange expression?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 04.ogg Keqing: Oh, I see, my apologies, I appear to have interrupted your conversation with Mr. Zhongli.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 05.ogg Keqing: Yes, I was going to ask you to introduce me to the adepti. I thought that it would be fitting to send them some festive gifts on behalf of the Liyue Qixing.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 06.ogg Keqing: Yes, but we only met briefly on that single occasion. The adepti may have already forgotten about me, and I'm concerned it would be imprudent to show up so suddenly.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 07.ogg Keqing: Which is why I thought it would be more appropriate to ask you to introduce me first.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 08b 1.ogg Keqing: Unfortunately, Ganyu is on leave at the moment, so I'm unable to get in touch with her.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 08b 2.ogg Keqing: I'm afraid I'll still require your assistance.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 09.ogg Keqing: Thank you, Traveler. Let me go and prepare the gifts.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 10.ogg Keqing: I'm sorry to make you run errands with me during our big festival. I promise to make this quick, and I'll be sure to get you back in time to enjoy the fireworks show.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 11.ogg Keqing: Huh? T—Together?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 12.ogg Keqing: Hmm, alright. I'll go to see the fireworks with you once I've finished my work.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 13.ogg Keqing: Speaking of which, Mr. Zhongli, the Fireworks Show will be particularly exciting this year. Please, don't miss it.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 14.ogg Keqing: I should be going now. Traveler, please come find me at the Jade Chamber once you're ready.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, are you guys talking about tasty food again?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh, isn't that pretty obvious? Anybody could have guessed that!
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Don't have to ask Paimon twice! Or once, even!
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? Y—You mean we're not gonna try any? Aww, fine, let's get down to business...
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Business? What kind of business would the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor possibly have during a festival?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Yeah. Everyone knows you're super knowledgeable, Paimon bets she would listen to someone like you!
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Oh, you're right... Then what should we do?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Umm, Paimon doesn't really get it...
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it! So we need to talk with people who know Keqing, right? Hmm, so who should we start with?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Huh? Oh, L—Lady Keqing!
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Keqing, are you here looking for us?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: But didn't you meet them when we were fighting to defend Liyue Harbor together?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: You could just as easily go and find them in Jueyun Karst.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: So you even have to run around delivering gifts in person... It sure doesn't seem easy to be a Qixing.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: And there she goes.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: You're really reliable too, Zhongli!
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 xiangling 01.ogg Xiangling: Hee-hee, that's my signature dipping sauce. I knew it would taste great!
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 xiangling 02.ogg Xiangling: You came at the perfect time, I was just letting everyone try my latest dish!
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 xiangling 03.ogg Xiangling: The owner of Third-Round Knockout says it's... well, a real knockout. Mr. Zhongli and Hu Tao seem to like it too, but I think it never hurts to let more people do a taste test.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 xiangling 04.ogg Xiangling: How about it, you two? Would you like to have a taste?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 xiangling 05.ogg Xiangling: Hee-hee... I am flattered. Thank you, Mr. Zhongli!
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 01.ogg Zhongli: Hmm. Tempered Jueyun Chili powder mixed with garlic paste and chopped scallions... Then seasoned with salt, vinegar, and soy sauce, before finally sizzling in hot oil.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 02.ogg Zhongli: This recipe may seem a bit crude, but is entirely hinged on the precise balancing of flavors and seasonings by the chef. Everything must be balanced just right.

Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 04.ogg Zhongli: We meet again, Traveler. I trust your journey is going well?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 05.ogg Zhongli: Splendid, therein lies the value of a journey.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 06.ogg Zhongli: Of course, I'll see you later, Director.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 07.ogg Zhongli: Now then, Traveler, what brings you to see me today?
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 08.ogg Zhongli: Hmm, yes. The Yuheng is honest, intelligent, and most diligent. She is capable of shouldering responsibilities that few others could, but everything has a balance, and one's health must certainly weigh in.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 09.ogg Zhongli: If I were still the mighty Rex Lapis, I might be able to help her see reason. But alas, I'm now nobody but an ordinary consultant. My words no longer carry the same weight as they once did.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 10.ogg Zhongli: Besides, I am by no means close to the Yuheng. Taking the liberty to lecture her may just as easily produce the opposite of the desired effect.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 11.ogg Zhongli: We could take a more subtle, indirect approach to the matter.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 12.ogg Zhongli: Such as telling a story that resonates with her, containing your message conveyed within it.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 13.ogg Zhongli: Such a story can be achieved by referencing topics from her daily life. The story could prove even more effective if you weave in something about someone close to her.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 14.ogg Zhongli: I knew you'd understand what to do, haha. Well done, Traveler.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 15.ogg Zhongli: Go collect some source materials for your story. Of course, I can always provide you with my advice, if needed.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 16.ogg Zhongli: Once we have formulated the plot, you can tell the story to the Yuheng.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 17.ogg Zhongli: You are on amiable terms with the Yuheng, which makes you the natural candidate.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 18.ogg Zhongli: You are most welcome, Yuheng. It was the least I could do.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 19.ogg Zhongli: Ah, yes. Thank you for your kind reminder.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 20.ogg Zhongli: That's the Yuheng, efficient and reliable as ever.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 21.ogg Zhongli: Why, thank you, Paimon.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 22.ogg Zhongli: Please don't forget our earlier conversation. Once you've collected enough story material, we can meet here again and discuss things further.
Media:vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 23.ogg Zhongli: You are too kind, Director. Your eloquence is *ahem* infamous in Liyue Harbor.
Ningguang leaves.
She always insists on going out into the wild herself to search for natural ingredients, and is thus often absent from the restaurant.

This young director is known for her sharp intellect, but in some peoples' eyes, Hu Tao might be a little too smart for her own good.
