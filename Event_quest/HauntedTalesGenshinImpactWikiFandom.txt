Kamisato Ayaka - Frostflake Heron
The lady of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, Kamisato Ayaka. Dignified and elegant, intelligent and tenacious.
All know that her character is unimpeachable, and that she is a gentle and approachable soul deeply loved by the people.
This is because she often represents the Yashiro Commission as it conducts affairs among the common folk.
But while she is often viewed as a restrained, collected individual, few understand that beneath the fame and the name, the young girl's heart is still filled with an unknown tenderness and loveliness.

(If the player has not met Sayu yet, an introductory note appears on screen)
Sayu - Mujina Ninja
Sayu, a ninja of the Shuumatsuban, is a petite figure skilled at skiving.
She is well-trained in many arts of concealment and covering her tracks, and she uses these to evade work and look for places to nap during the day.
This is not laziness, of course! Rather, she is simply spending time on more important matters, such as sleeping more, so that she can grow taller... Or at least, that's how Sayu would rationalize things.
Also, the animal her clothes are based on it is a mujina, not a tanuki. You'd better remember that!

(If the player has not met Yoimiya yet, an introductory note appears on screen)
Yoimiya - Frolicking Flames
The present owner of Naganohara Fireworks. Hero to the children, Queen of the Summer Festival â€” also known as Yoimiya.
Inazuma has yearly festivals that all feature fireworks painstaking made by her. Her creativity itself burns hot and brightly, and brings people endless, incomparable joy.
Yoimiya's heart has yet to lose its childlike innocence, and she often plays simple but evergreen games with the children, or goes with them to find some shiny objects. The purity of these children brings her great happiness.
Though fireworks are fleeting things, their radiance remains in peoples' hearts. This miracle is momentary yet also eternal, and this is how she "protects" those around her.

Youko: It's said that long ago
Youko: A human samurai once stumbled across the Mikawa Flower Festival
Youkai #1: What's a human doing here?
Youkai #2: We erected the barrier, didn't we? Ugh, what a pain...
Youko: The youkai at the festival began discussing
Youko: How to drive away the human
Youko: When suddenly, they heard a voice
Kamai Kenji: This is our festival, and the point is to have fun!
Kamai Kenji: What difference does it make if a human joins us youkai!?
Youko: The speaker appeared to be a prominent figure among the youkai
Youko: And when he spoke, the other youkai fell silent
Kamai Kenji: You there, young man. Do you drink sake?
Yanagibashi Takuto: ...Yes, I do
Kamai Kenji: Hah! Then join us. We can enjoy tonight's festivities together. Haha!
Youko: And so, the youkai and samurai celebrated together
Youko: The two competed in the highlight of the festival: the Akitsu Hazura (Haneasobi)
Youko: Their spectacular game ended in a draw, and a new friendship was forged...
Kamai Kenji: Haha, I can't believe a human could keep up with me
Yanagibashi Takuto: Witnessing the dynamic powers of the youkai
Yanagibashi Takuto: Will certainly help hone my swordsmanship
Kamai Kenji: You're a swordsman!?
Yanagibashi Takuto: Yes, I'm currently traveling the world in search of formidable opponents
Kamai Kenji: Then let's make a deal
Kamai Kenji: We meet for a duel every ten years, whaddya say?
Yanagibashi Takuto: I look forward to it
(Cinematic ends)
 "The hunter by day becomes the hunted by night."
 Everyone has their reasons.
 Go ahead, you can tell us.
 Huh?
 I concede.
 I don't see any change.
Media:vo sdeq002 35 sayu 03b 1.ogg Sayu: Aww, how come...
 I still need to give it some more thought.
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 sayu 02b 1.ogg Sayu: Okay... If you want me to be your partner, you can find me here.
 I still need to give it some more thought.
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 02b 1.ogg Thoma: Ah, not a problem. I still wish you the best of luck, no matter who you chose to team up with.
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 02b 2.ogg Thoma: Just be sure not to put too much pressure on yourself. The Test of Courage is meant to be a fun event, focusing only on winning would defeat the whole purpose of participating.
 I still need to give it some more thought.
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 02b 1.ogg Yoimiya: Ah, really? That's a bummer...
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 02b 2.ogg Yoimiya: Well anyway, I'll be right here if you change your mind!
 I want to partner up with Sayu.

Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10a 3.ogg Sayu: It's pretty scary here, but I'm going to face my fears this time.
 I want to partner up with Thoma.
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 02a 1.ogg Thoma: Really? Thank you.
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 02a 2.ogg Thoma: I can't guarantee we'll be able to win the second round, but I'll do my best to help. Let's give it our best shot!
 I want to partner up with Thoma.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 11a 1.ogg Thoma: Really? Thank you.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 11a 2.ogg Thoma: I can't guarantee we'll be able to win the second round, but I'll do my best to help. Let's give it our best shot!
 I want to partner up with Yoimiya.
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 02a 1.ogg Yoimiya: Hehe, awesome! Don't worry, you'll see that being on my team is a blast!
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 02a 2.ogg Yoimiya: Now let's get out there and win this thing... We'll move faster than a firework shooting straight into the sky! It'll be like WHOOOSHHH and the round will be ours!
 I want to partner up with Yoimiya.
Media:vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 06a 1.ogg Yoimiya: Hehe, awesome! Don't worry, you'll see that being on my team is a blast!
Media:vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 06a 2.ogg Yoimiya: Now let's get out there and win this thing... We'll move faster than a firework shooting straight into the sky! It'll be like WHOOOSHHH and the round will be ours!
 It must have been Ayato.
 It's alright, no need to tell him for now.
 Itto's showing some of his better qualities this time.
 Let me think about it...
Media:vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 06b 1.ogg Yoimiya: Oh, I understand. You have to put some thought into choosing the best partner... You did already win the first round, after all.
Media:vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 06b 2.ogg Yoimiya: But I'm definitely no pushover when it comes to the Test of Courage. I've been to loads of these events.
Media:vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 06b 3.ogg Yoimiya: Besides, choosing me means you'll have one less tough competitor to deal with, hehe! Anyway, give it some thought.
 Let me think about it...
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10b 1.ogg Sayu: It's okay, no rush. I came here for my own reasons anyway.
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10b 2.ogg Sayu: I'll try to overcome my fear... and sleepiness.
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10b 3.ogg Sayu: But, if you do want to partner up, just let me know...
 Let me think about it...
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 11b 1.ogg Thoma: Ah, I understand. Hope you can find the right partner and win the second round.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 11b 2.ogg Thoma: You've probably already heard that to win the Grand Narukami Shrine's special prize. You have to win all three rounds.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 11b 3.ogg Thoma: I'd like to know what the prize is as well... And you're the only one who has that chance now, so go for it!
 Maybe she just wants to be left alone.
 Maybe we can help you.
 Quest DescriptionYou encountered something peculiar in the first round, and the second is just about to begin...
 She's messing with you.
 Step DescriptionAfter chatting with the little youkai, it turns out that the mysterious woman is not one of them... Who is she?
 Step DescriptionAfter completing the Test of Courage, you hear Itto's voice in the woods...
 Step DescriptionHeizou suggested temporarily hiding what you just saw and heard to avoid causing unwanted complications. It's almost time for the second Test of Courage. Head over to the site.
 Step DescriptionIt turns out that your peculiar encounters were a misunderstanding: the little youkai were only making preparations for a festival. Now that all the tension has gone, perhaps you should go to the beach and take a look.
 Step DescriptionOn the beach, you encountered the mysterious woman you had seen somewhere before. You decide to play a game of Akitsu Yuugei. The loser will grant the winner a wish.
 Step DescriptionThe staff said you needed another partner. Who will it be...
 Step DescriptionTime to go meet the staff with your partner.
 Step DescriptionYou decided to join Sayu in the second round. What challenges will you encounter along the way?
 Step DescriptionYou decided to join Thoma in the second round. What challenges will you encounter along the way?
 Step DescriptionYou decided to join Yoimiya in the second round. What challenges will you encounter along the way?
 Step DescriptionYou didn't expect that her wish was to never cross paths with you again. It sounded a little sad... Is that what she really wanted? You can't know for sure right now, so you decide to check on the little youkai first.
 There's nothing behind us.
 Uh, maybe a little.
Media:vo sdeq002 35 sayu 03a 1.ogg Sayu: Really? Ah, that's great!
 Wait a minute, we did meet some lady who was all dressed up...
 We heard that someone had been trapped in Akitsu Yuugei.
 We never managed to find those three, either.
 We're your friends, too.
 What did you notice, Heizou?
 You mean, the Mikawa Flower Festival?
 You win.
All know that her character is unimpeachable, and that she is a gentle and approachable soul deeply loved by the people.
Also, the animal her clothes are based on it is a mujina, not a tanuki. You'd better remember that!

Kamisato Ayaka - Frostflake Heron
Media:Vo dialog sdeq002 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Could the rumors be true then? Do strange phenomena really happen every time the Test of Courage is held...?
Media:Vo dialog sdeq002 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Please, be careful.
Media:Vo dialog sdeq002 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: "Recite this to yourself, keep your mind clear and at peace. Free your thoughts from spirits and ghosts"...
Media:Vo dialog sdeq002 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Those were Her Excellency's remarks in the directive. She once said, "There is nothing to be afraid of as long as your conscience is clear."
Media:Vo dialog sdeq002 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: If only Her Excellency were here. She would get to the bottom of this in no time.
Media:Vo dialog sdeq002 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Unease pervades the air, and fear is spreading
Media:Vo dialog sdeq002 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Maybe this is the real Test of Courage...? It's already becoming an unforgettable experience for me.
Media:Vo dialog sdeq002 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Shh... this is one of my usual hiding spots. It's always safe here.
Media:Vo dialog sdeq002 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: Let me show you a trick. Just cover your eyes, and the scary things will go away...
Media:Vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: I believe my lord had foreseen this situation...
Media:Vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: He has my absolute trust, but given Lady Ayaka is still here, we must get to the bottom of this as soon as possible.
Media:Vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: So is there really a ghost around here?
Media:Vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 04.ogg Yoimiya: I'm gonna go look for it. I've never seen a ghost before! Oh, how exciting!
Media:Vo sdeq002 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? Hear what?
Media:Vo sdeq002 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whaaaaa! Stay away from Paimon!!!
Media:Vo sdeq002 12 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: *sobs* Thank goodness...
Media:Vo sdeq002 12 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: Hey, did you guys hear that?
Media:Vo sdeq002 12 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: It sounded like it came from inside the shrine.
Media:Vo sdeq002 12 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: I've heard people say that some evil spirits are sealed in shrines, and at night they make banging sounds from inside.
Media:Vo sdeq002 12 yoimiya 04.ogg Yoimiya: Whenever someone approaches, a spirit will â€” POW â€” leap out and pull that unfortunate person inside the shrine, using the victim to replace themself [sic] as the prisoner!
Media:Vo sdeq002 12 yoimiya 05.ogg Yoimiya: Huh? Oh, it's a kitty. Not gonna lie, that's kinda disappointing! I was hoping to see a real evil spirit!
Media:Vo sdeq002 14 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: On second thought, mâ€”maybe we shouldn't go! Oh, Paimon's heart is pounding like crazy!
Media:Vo sdeq002 14 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: Oh, you're right! That wasn't there when we arrived!
Media:Vo sdeq002 14 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: There's clearly no one around, but there's a shadow on the ground. Oh, this is like a real kaidan story!
Media:Vo sdeq002 14 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: Let's go check it out!
Media:Vo sdeq002 17 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh, another stall? It sure looks familiar...
Media:Vo sdeq002 17 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wait, this is the same stall we saw earlier![Note 1]
Media:Vo sdeq002 18 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ah, it's back again! Maybe it's following us. Ah, help!
Media:Vo sdeq002 22 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm... This isn't what we're looking for. Oh, and Paimon thought we had it, too...
Media:Vo sdeq002 23 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's a dead end... Where did they hide that fan?
Media:Vo sdeq002 24 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: You want to explore somewhere else? Uh, how about we finish the Test of Courage first!
Media:Vo sdeq002 36 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: This doesn't seem to be the right way. Let's try another path!
Media:Vo sdeq002 41 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Hmm? Did something fall down here?
Media:Vo sdeq002 41 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Oh! It's some Onikabuto! Don't worry. This species is very docile. They're not nearly as scary as they look.
Media:Vo sdeq002 41 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: If anything, they're more scared of us than we are of them. Let's leave them alone and they'll eventually climb back up into the tree.
Media:Vo sdeq002 42 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh, Thoma, did you hear that?
Media:Vo sdeq002 42 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It sounded like a rattling sound... Ah! It seems to be coming from the shrine over there!
Media:Vo sdeq002 42 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Be careful, Thoma!
Media:Vo sdeq002 42 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Yeah, you're right. Please wait here for a moment, I'll go check it out.
Media:Vo sdeq002 42 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: The sound doesn't seem to be coming from the inside of the shrine! Maybe it's from behind...? Huh?
Media:Vo sdeq002 42 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Oh, it's just a little cat. How did you end up here, hmm? Are you hungry?
Media:Vo sdeq002 42 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Just a second, I have some Dried Fish with me. Here you go...
Media:Vo sdeq002 43 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? Where...? Aaah! You're right!
Media:Vo sdeq002 43 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Now's not the time to worry about that! Just run!
Media:Vo sdeq002 43 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Hmm? What's that following us? Is it a floating Lavender Melon?
Media:Vo sdeq002 43 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: That was the last thing I was expecting to see. How did they manage that, I wonder?
Media:Vo sdeq002 44 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh, is it just Paimon, or is there an eerie shadow over there?
Media:Vo sdeq002 44 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ah, it's the ghost! The ghost came back! Run kids!!!
Media:Vo sdeq002 44 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Oh, yeah... Hmm, that wasn't there when we arrived!
Media:Vo sdeq002 44 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Reminds me of a kaidan I heard. Once upon a time, there were four children who used to play together every day until one day, one of them mysteriously vanished.
Media:Vo sdeq002 44 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: The remaining three children searched high and low for their friend, but were unable to find him.
Media:Vo sdeq002 44 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Then, one day, while the children were chatting, one of them suddenly showed a creepy smile and said, "He's back."
Media:Vo sdeq002 44 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: The other two were confused, until they followed the child's pointing finger to the ground, only to see four shadows...
Media:Vo sdeq002 44 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Hahaha... Hey, come on. No need to get so worked up. it's just a kaidan story. Let's keep going.
Media:Vo sdeq002 45 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: You're so relaxed, Thoma! You act like we're just out on another hike!
Media:Vo sdeq002 45 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yes, please! Would you guys like some sushi too? Huh? Why do these statues seem to be staring at Paimon...
Media:Vo sdeq002 45 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: W-wait, are these statues... supposed to be facing this way?
Media:Vo sdeq002 45 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Forget the sushi! Run!!!
Media:Vo sdeq002 45 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Care to take a break and have some snacks?
Media:Vo sdeq002 45 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: I brought some homemade sushi and onigiri that I prepared. Would you like some?
Media:Vo sdeq002 45 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: And the candles went out! Is there something scary happening here, too? Uh, anyway, here's the sushi...
Media:Vo sdeq002 46 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Do they have anything to eat?
Media:Vo sdeq002 46 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Huh... I didn't expect to find a stall here.
Media:Vo sdeq002 46 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: I'm not sure, the owner's nowhere to be seen.
Media:Vo sdeq002 46 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Now that I look at it, this stall is pretty dirty... The wood seems to be pretty old and is caked with dust.
Media:Vo sdeq002 46 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Well, guess I'll have to spruce it up a little.
Media:Vo sdeq002 49 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: You think so? Paimon thinks they look a little spooky...
Media:Vo sdeq002 49 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Good thing these lanterns are here, they sure make the path a lot brighter.
Media:Vo sdeq002 49 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: Despite what the lanterns look like, whoever placed them here probably didn't mean any harm.
Media:Vo sdeq002 49 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Believe me, there's plenty of other options if they intended to cause us harm. Alright, let's continue, shall we?
Media:Vo sdeq002 50 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Let Paimon see... Oh, it has fireworks printed on it, so it must be for some sort of festival!
Media:Vo sdeq002 50 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh... Paimon thought Ayato would choose a folding fan... You know, like the kind Ayaka usually uses.
Media:Vo sdeq002 50 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm, wonder if Itto's still out trying to capture those three from earlier. Paimon's a little worried about him... Why don't we have a look around?
Media:Vo sdeq002 50 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Ah, this must be the fan we're looking for.
Media:Vo sdeq002 50 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: Seems we're the first to find it, too. Our luck's not so bad after all.
Media:Vo sdeq002 50 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: You're right, this fan doesn't appear to be something my lord would usually use...
Media:Vo sdeq002 50 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: Anyway, let's head back now that we've found it.
Media:Vo sdeq002 50 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Hmm? Are you planning to stay here? Then allow me to take the fan back.
Media:Vo sdeq002 50 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: But remember, you're only one round away from taking home the special prize! Make sure you get yourselves ready and give it your best shot.
Media:Vo sdeq002 51 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: This doesn't seem to be the right way. Let's try another path!
Media:Vo sdeq002 52 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm... This isn't what we're looking for. Oh, and Paimon thought we had it, too...
Media:Vo sdeq002 54 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Wait, where are you going?
Media:Vo sdeq002 55 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: I'm feeling a little worn out myself, let's stop and take a break for a while.
Media:vo dialog sdeq001 hitomi 01.ogg Shrine Maiden: Have you found a partner yet?
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Don't freak out, boys! Whatever happens, I'll protect you!
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Oh, will you pair up with me for the Test of Courage?
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 sayu 02a 1.ogg Sayu: Really? You're willing to be my partner?
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 sayu 02a 2.ogg Sayu: Great... But please keep an eye on me, and don't let me fall asleep again.
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 sayu 02a 3.ogg Sayu: It's pretty scary here, but I'm going to face my fears this time.
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 sayu 02b 1.ogg Sayu: Okay... If you want me to be your partner, you can find me here.
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Haha, want to team up with me?
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 02a 1.ogg Thoma: Really? Thank you.
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 02a 2.ogg Thoma: I can't guarantee we'll be able to win the second round, but I'll do my best to help. Let's give it our best shot!
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 02b 1.ogg Thoma: Ah, not a problem. I still wish you the best of luck, no matter who you chose to team up with.
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 02b 2.ogg Thoma: Just be sure not to put too much pressure on yourself. The Test of Courage is meant to be a fun event, focusing only on winning would defeat the whole purpose of participating.
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 together 01.ogg Mamoru, Akira, and Genta: You're the best, Boss!
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: So, made up your mind yet? Do you wanna team up with me?
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 02a 1.ogg Yoimiya: Hehe, awesome! Don't worry, you'll see that being on my team is a blast!
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 02a 2.ogg Yoimiya: Now let's get out there and win this thing... We'll move faster than a firework shooting straight into the sky! It'll be like WHOOOSHHH and the round will be ours!
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 02b 1.ogg Yoimiya: Ah, really? That's a bummer...
Media:vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 02b 2.ogg Yoimiya: Well anyway, I'll be right here if you change your mind!
Media:vo sdeq002 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Well, the second round of the Test of Courage is about to begin.
Media:vo sdeq002 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmm, Paimon wonders if the shrine maiden knows anything about what Heizou told us... Let's go ask her.
Media:vo sdeq002 10 hitomi 01.ogg Shrine Maiden: You appear to have found a partner. Let's see if you can repeat your luck from the first round.
Media:vo sdeq002 10 hitomi 02.ogg Shrine Maiden: Though, whether winning should be considered "good luck" or not is debatable, hehehe...
Media:vo sdeq002 10 hitomi 03.ogg Shrine Maiden: Anyway, I will now reveal the item you'll be searching for in the second round of the Test of Courage.
Media:vo sdeq002 10 hitomi 04.ogg Shrine Maiden: It's... a "fan."
Media:vo sdeq002 10 hitomi 05.ogg Shrine Maiden: Correct. The fan was personally selected by the Yashiro Commissioner himself, and has been placed somewhere in the Chinju Forest.
Media:vo sdeq002 10 hitomi 06.ogg Shrine Maiden: There will be signs to guide the way, but beware, the darkness that lurks in the forest is drawing nearer.
Media:vo sdeq002 10 hitomi 07.ogg Shrine Maiden: Mwahahahaha... Remember, if you can't go on any further, you can always give up and live to see another day.
Media:vo sdeq002 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: A fan? You mean like the thing we use to keep cool when it's hot out?
Media:vo sdeq002 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We'll never give up! Let's go!
Media:vo sdeq002 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Something just fell from above! Ah, keep it away from Paimon!!!
Media:vo sdeq002 11 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: Really? Lemme see... Oh! It's some Onikabuto!
Media:vo sdeq002 11 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: And pretty strong ones, from the looks of it. I'll hold on to them! Hehe, they'll come in real handy for the next Onikabuto tournament!
Media:vo sdeq002 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, Paimon's over here! That doesn't even look like Paimon!
Media:vo sdeq002 13 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: That's strange... How did Paimon transform into a Lavender Melon?
Media:vo sdeq002 13 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: Hmm? So, what in the world is this...? Hey, it's flying away. Don't go! Let me have a look at ya!
Media:vo sdeq002 14 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh, is it just Paimon, or is there an eerie shadow over there?
Media:vo sdeq002 15 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Phew... This should be far enough.
Media:vo sdeq002 15 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yes, please! Whew, let's rest here... Huh?
Media:vo sdeq002 15 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wâ€”Wâ€”Wait a minute! Was that statue always facing this way?
Media:vo sdeq002 15 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: The candles also went out! What's going on? Is something coming...? Oh, let's get out of here!!!
Media:vo sdeq002 15 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: Are you tired, Paimon? Do you want to take a break?
Media:vo sdeq002 15 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: Whoa, Paimon wasn't kidding! The statue really did move. Wonder how that works...
Media:vo sdeq002 16 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yay! Thanks, Yoimiya.
Media:vo sdeq002 16 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: Hmm? What is this stall doing here? Maybe it's for participants who need a break?
Media:vo sdeq002 16 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: Excuse me! Three glasses of juice, please...
Media:vo sdeq002 16 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: Hehe! Don't worry, this time it's on me!
Media:vo sdeq002 16 yoimiya 04.ogg Yoimiya: Uh, excuse me! Anyone here? Strange... seems like no one's around. Guess we'll just have to keep going.
Media:vo sdeq002 19 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh, that's definitely not normal!
Media:vo sdeq002 19 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: No! Now's not the time!
Media:vo sdeq002 19 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: Wow, look at all the lanterns here! It's so beautiful!
Media:vo sdeq002 19 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: But now that I look closer, it seems like the lanterns are floating in midair. How is that possible?
Media:vo sdeq002 19 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: Hey (Traveler), can I borrow your shoulders for a second? You can give me a boost and I'll pull one of them down!
Media:vo sdeq002 2 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Hey, you guys finally made it!
Media:vo sdeq002 2 itto 02.ogg Arataki Itto: I was searching for hours. Still didn't see any sign of those three, so I decided to come back.
Media:vo sdeq002 2 itto 03.ogg Arataki Itto: How about you? Find anything?
Media:vo sdeq002 2 itto 04.ogg Arataki Itto: I see... So you came up empty-handed, too.
Media:vo sdeq002 2 itto 05.ogg Arataki Itto: Well, it doesn't matter! I already came up with a new plan!
Media:vo sdeq002 2 itto 06.ogg Arataki Itto: Shinobu told me a saying after she got back from studying in Liyue. It went something like... "The something by day becomes..." Uhh, something by night?
Media:vo sdeq002 2 itto 07.ogg Arataki Itto: Yeah, that's what I said! C'mon, keep up!
Media:vo sdeq002 2 itto 08.ogg Arataki Itto: Anyway, I was so focused on scaring people last round that those three dressed up as ghosts caught me completely off guard.
Media:vo sdeq002 2 itto 09.ogg Arataki Itto: But not this time! Oh no! I'll be hiding nearby and waiting for those three to emerge first, then I'll nail 'em with a surprise attack.
Media:vo sdeq002 2 itto 10.ogg Arataki Itto: You two just gotta keep playing it natural and join the contest. Got it? Okay, see ya later!
Media:vo sdeq002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh, it's kinda hard to explain...
Media:vo sdeq002 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? What plan?
Media:vo sdeq002 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wait, Itto! Ugh, he ran off again!
Media:vo sdeq002 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Well, his plan does make some sense at least... Let's go talk to the shrine maiden so we can join the second round.
Media:vo sdeq002 20 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Phew... Thank goodness it's over!
Media:vo sdeq002 20 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmm, wonder if Itto's still out trying to capture those three from earlier. Paimon's a little worried about him... Why don't we have a look around?
Media:vo sdeq002 20 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Thank you~! That would help.
Media:vo sdeq002 20 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: Hehe! Look what we have here! Isn't this the fan we're looking for?
Media:vo sdeq002 20 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: Wow, it has such a beautiful design on it. Are those fireworks? It seems to be for some sort of festival!
Media:vo sdeq002 20 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: So now that we've found this fan, does that mean we've won the second round of the Test of Courage? Let's bring it back!
Media:vo sdeq002 20 yoimiya 04.ogg Yoimiya: Hmm? Is there something else you need to take care of? How about I take the fan back, then?
Media:vo sdeq002 20 yoimiya 05.ogg Yoimiya: No need to thank me. It's been a blast doing the Test of Courage with you guys! I'd love to do it again!
Media:vo sdeq002 21 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: This doesn't seem to be the right way. Let's try another path!
Media:vo sdeq002 25 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: C'mon, let's go. We can't let anyone beat us to it!
Media:vo sdeq002 26 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: She's gone! We should get out of here too!
Media:vo sdeq002 26 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Something just fell from above...
Media:vo sdeq002 26 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: I'm outta here... Yoohoo Art!
Media:vo sdeq002 27 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What? Paimon's teeth aren't chattering.
Media:vo sdeq002 27 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's definitely not Paimon! Wait... It seems to be coming from inside the shrine!
Media:vo sdeq002 27 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: There's something over there...
Media:vo sdeq002 27 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Phew, it's just a cat. Thank goodness...
Media:vo sdeq002 27 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: I can hear your teeth chattering, Paimon. You must be really scared.
Media:vo sdeq002 27 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: I understand, I'm scared too...
Media:vo sdeq002 27 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: But I heard a rattling sound... Was that not you?
Media:vo sdeq002 28 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, that's not Paimon! It doesn't look anything like me!
Media:vo sdeq002 28 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon's over here!
Media:vo sdeq002 28 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: It's so dark here. It's hard to make out anything.
Media:vo sdeq002 28 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: It's so dim that Paimon almost looks like a flying Lavender Melon...
Media:vo sdeq002 28 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: Ah! It's a... Lavender Melon ghost!
Media:vo sdeq002 29 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh, is it just Paimon, or is there an eerie shadow over there?
Media:vo sdeq002 29 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wait for Paimon!!!
Media:vo sdeq002 29 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Please leave Paimon alone! Paimon doesn't taste very good!
Media:vo sdeq002 29 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hear that? Just leave us alone!!!
Media:vo sdeq002 29 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Ah... You're right... Run!
Media:vo sdeq002 29 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Yeah, mâ€”me neither...
Media:vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 01.ogg Shrine Maiden: Mwahahaha... Congratulations on winning the first round of the Test of Courage.
Media:vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 02.ogg Shrine Maiden: Now you're one step closer to the dark, messy truth. But is that really a good thing?
Media:vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 03.ogg Shrine Maiden: Oh, really? Good to hear.
Media:vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 04.ogg Shrine Maiden: Hearing the words "super terrifying" is exactly what all us event organizers would like to hear.
Media:vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 05.ogg Shrine Maiden: So what? You've heard the stories about the Test of Courage, haven't you?
Media:vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 06.ogg Shrine Maiden: Everyone who participates in the event faces a variety of emotions.
Media:vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 07.ogg Shrine Maiden: People are afraid of seeing their innermost fears appear before them, yet they still seek the thrill of experiencing those fears.
Media:vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 08.ogg Shrine Maiden: So isn't it natural for us to have things in the dark and deathly silent forest to help fulfill that experience?
Media:vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 09.ogg Shrine Maiden: Just like the grinning monster standing behind you right now, waiting for you to turn around...
Media:vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 10.ogg Shrine Maiden: Hehehe... I knew a little trick like that wouldn't be enough to scare you off.
Media:vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 11.ogg Shrine Maiden: So, congrats on passing this test. The second round of the Test of Courage will begin shortly.
Media:vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 12.ogg Shrine Maiden: Have you found your partner yet?
Media:vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 13.ogg Shrine Maiden: Yes, your team's outstanding effort certainly won you the last round.
Media:vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 14.ogg Shrine Maiden: So it's understandable that you'd want to pair up with your previous partner... But unfortunately, you must find a different partner for each round of the event.
Media:vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 15.ogg Shrine Maiden: If you don't have a partner by the time the next round begins, then...
Media:vo sdeq002 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, cut the nonsense! What we just saw was super terrifying!
Media:vo sdeq002 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ugh no, that's not what Paimon means! Something mysterious is also happening here, not just the event!
Media:vo sdeq002 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Aaaah!!! Really!?
Media:vo sdeq002 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? But don't we already have a partner from the last round...?
Media:vo sdeq002 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Yeah, yeah, Paimon already knows! If we don't have a partner in time, then we'll be disqualified!
Media:vo sdeq002 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Let's ask around and see if there's anyone looking for a partner!
Media:vo sdeq002 30 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Phew, thank goodness! We've finally made it to a safe spot...
Media:vo sdeq002 30 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh Sayu, was that statue always facing this way?
Media:vo sdeq002 30 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: And why does Paimon have a feeling that it's staring right at us...?
Media:vo sdeq002 30 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Run!!!
Media:vo sdeq002 30 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: I usually like to hide here and take a nap...
Media:vo sdeq002 30 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Don't worry. There doesn't appear to be anything scary here.
Media:vo sdeq002 30 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: What? That can't be right... This is supposed to be a safe place...
Media:vo sdeq002 30 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: Oh, we have to high tail it out of here! Yoohoo Art... Let's go!
Media:vo sdeq002 31 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We've been running for so long that Paimon's starting to get thirsty.
Media:vo sdeq002 31 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh look, there's a stall set up. Let's go buy something to drink.
Media:vo sdeq002 31 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hello? Anyone here? Strange, there's nobody around.
Media:vo sdeq002 31 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Waaaah! You're right, it's starting to creep Paimon out! Let's just get outta here!
Media:vo sdeq002 31 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Good idea!
Media:vo sdeq002 31 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Oh, I dunno... This stall looks kinda spooky.
Media:vo sdeq002 34 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: There sure are a lot of lanterns here! Are they supposed to guide us?
Media:vo sdeq002 34 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ah! Don't scare Paimon! Dâ€”Do we keep going?
Media:vo sdeq002 34 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: *Sobs* Paimon can't take it anymore, you go first!
Media:vo sdeq002 34 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: I heard there are lanterns that release a chilly breeze to guide spirits to be reincarnated...
Media:vo sdeq002 34 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: This is getting pretty creepy...
Media:vo sdeq002 35 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Enough about that. Look! Isn't this the fan we're looking for?
Media:vo sdeq002 35 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It has fireworks printed on it, so it must be for some kind of festival!
Media:vo sdeq002 35 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yep, seems like it. Haha, we've won again!
Media:vo sdeq002 35 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hmm, wonder if Itto's still out trying to capture those three from earlier. Paimon's a little worried about him... Why don't we have a look around?
Media:vo sdeq002 35 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Phew... this place should be safe.
Media:vo sdeq002 35 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: I can't believe I made it this far. Hey, did I get any taller?
Media:vo sdeq002 35 sayu 03a 1.ogg Sayu: Really? Ah, that's great!
Media:vo sdeq002 35 sayu 03b 1.ogg Sayu: Aww, how come...
Media:vo sdeq002 35 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: So does that mean the second round of the Test of Courage is over now?
Media:vo sdeq002 35 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: Great. *yawn* Because I was just starting... to feel sleepy...
Media:vo sdeq002 35 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: In that case, I'll take the fan back with me and have a little nap. Just don't stay out here too long...
Media:vo sdeq002 37 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm... This isn't what we're looking for. Oh, and Paimon thought we had it, too...
Media:vo sdeq002 38 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's a dead end... Where did they hide that fan?
Media:vo sdeq002 39 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: Hey, the sign is pointing this way. Please come back...
Media:vo sdeq002 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh, Yoimiya! You're here too?
Media:vo sdeq002 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hehe... Actually, Paimon still doesn't know how we managed to find it.
Media:vo sdeq002 4 paimon 03a.ogg Media:vo sdeq002 4 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: Paimon was just hiding behind (him/her) the whole time, and somehow we won!
Media:vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: Heya (Traveler), Paimon! I had a feeling you two would be here!
Media:vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: Mm-hmm. I was also here for the first round, but I arrived a little early, so maybe that's why I didn't see you.
Media:vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: By the way, I heard you were the winners. Impressive! I eventually found the hidden Dango Milk too, but it was already too late.
Media:vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 04.ogg Yoimiya: (Traveler), you never told me you were so good at this sort of event... You weren't keeping it a secret, were you?
Media:vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 05.ogg Yoimiya: Anyway, would ya like to pair up with me? We'd be an amazing team! With us working together, the second round will be a piece of cake.
Media:vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 06a 1.ogg Yoimiya: Hehe, awesome! Don't worry, you'll see that being on my team is a blast!
Media:vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 06a 2.ogg Yoimiya: Now let's get out there and win this thing... We'll move faster than a firework shooting straight into the sky! It'll be like WHOOOSHHH and the round will be ours!
Media:vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 06b 1.ogg Yoimiya: Oh, I understand. You have to put some thought into choosing the best partner... You did already win the first round, after all.
Media:vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 06b 2.ogg Yoimiya: But I'm definitely no pushover when it comes to the Test of Courage. I've been to loads of these events.
Media:vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 06b 3.ogg Yoimiya: Besides, choosing me means you'll have one less tough competitor to deal with, hehe! Anyway, give it some thought.
Media:vo sdeq002 40 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: I'm feeling a little sleepy...
Media:vo sdeq002 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, Sayu! Are you here for the Test of Courage, too?
Media:vo sdeq002 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: She looks like she just woke up... No wait, she's actually trying to fall asleep!
Media:vo sdeq002 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: A big bull-headed beast... Wait, that sounds like Ushi!
Media:vo sdeq002 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, poor Sayu... Wait, but why would you join the Test of Courage in the first place?
Media:vo sdeq002 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: What kind of silly idea is that!? That's just a load of baloney!
Media:vo sdeq002 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Well, Sayu doesn't have a partner yet. Should we team up with her?
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: *snoring* Huh? Ah, you found me...
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 02.ogg Sayu: Yes... *yawn*
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 03.ogg Sayu: The Test of Courage is too scary, so I keep my eyes closed to not feel scared.
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 04.ogg Sayu: But as soon as I close my eyes, it's really easy to fall asleep...
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 05.ogg Sayu: During the first round, a big bull-headed beast leaped out of nowhere and scared me half to death, so I ran and hid behind a tree.
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 06.ogg Sayu: I closed my eyes and tried to hide for a while, but it was really dark and I fell asleep... By the time I woke up, the round was already over.
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 07.ogg Sayu: Now, no one wants to partner up with me for the second round.
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 08.ogg Sayu: Oh, because I heard that being frightened causes you to grow taller...
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 09.ogg Sayu: I wasn't sure if it was true, either, but since I heard it could help people grow taller, I decided to give it a shot...
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10a 1.ogg Sayu: Really? You're willing to be my partner?
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10a 2.ogg Sayu: Great... But please keep an eye on me, and don't let me fall asleep again.
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10a 3.ogg Sayu: It's pretty scary here, but I'm going to face my fears this time.
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10b 1.ogg Sayu: It's okay, no rush. I came here for my own reasons anyway.
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10b 2.ogg Sayu: I'll try to overcome my fear... and sleepiness.
Media:vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10b 3.ogg Sayu: But, if you do want to partner up, just let me know...
Media:vo sdeq002 53 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's a dead end... Where did they hide that fan?
Media:vo sdeq002 56 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Hahaha! I've gotcha now!
Media:vo sdeq002 56 itto 02.ogg Arataki Itto: Hah! Don't underestimate this oni! None of you are getting away today!
Media:vo sdeq002 56 kappa 01.ogg ???: Ah, just run! Don't worry about me!
Media:vo sdeq002 56 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, it's Itto! It looks like he captured those three we were looking for!
Media:vo sdeq002 56 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's go see!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 01.ogg ???: Yeah, that's right! So just get on with it... If you're gonna eat us, then you'll have to deal with all three of us!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 02.ogg ???: We won't back down, even if... even if we're already in your stomach!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 03.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: According to legends, oni are grouchy, extremely strong, and crush other youkai into balls to eat them up!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 04.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: ...
Media:vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 05.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: Really? You're not mad?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 06.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: Yep, that was us! Have you tried it yet? Isn't it fun?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 07.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: We drew inspiration from the legendary Akitsu Hazura. It took a lot of youkai power to set it up.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 08.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: After that, we didn't have much youkai power left, so we set up some stalls in the forest to add to the festival atmosphere...
Media:vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 09.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: Really?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 10.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: Yeah, but that wasn't us!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 11.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: After that incident, people stopped coming to the attraction.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 12.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: It wasn't long before large numbers of people began coming to the Chinju Forest!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 13.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: And visitors were playing Akitsu Yuugei again. It was wonderful.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Hmm... I have a weird feeling that I've seen these three somewhere before...
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 02.ogg Arataki Itto: Ah, I know! These are all creatures from the Ultimate Youkai Field Guide that granny used to show me!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 03.ogg Arataki Itto: There's Youko, Kappa, and Hitotsume Kozou! They're all youkai.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 04.ogg Arataki Itto: Pfff! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! Who came up with that!?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 05.ogg Arataki Itto: Besides, you're the ones people are scared of! Hiding behind bushes and scaring people off the road, what are you trying to do here?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 06a.ogg Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 06b.ogg Arataki Itto: Don't think I didn't see you! ...Following (him/her) around and conjuring up all sorts of weird, scary stuff.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 07.ogg Arataki Itto: Mikawa Flower Festival... huh, that does ring a bell.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 08.ogg Arataki Itto: Ah right, it used to be hosted by the top youkai. I heard it was supposed to be a lot of fun... I mean, not as fun as my Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival, but still...
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 09.ogg Arataki Itto: Ah, I get it now. You wanna repay the favor, but your powers are too puny!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 10.ogg Arataki Itto: Hey, don't let it get to ya. You might be a bunch of pip-squeaks, but you're all solid youkai in my book!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 11.ogg Arataki Itto: Ah, I know the one!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 12.ogg Arataki Itto: Hmm, they don't look like they're lying, and believe me, I know a liar when I see one! Maybe it really was just an accident.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 13.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh, so my bro Ayato is here for the Test of Courage, too?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 14.ogg Arataki Itto: Or maybe he's here to catch Onikabuto... Ha, had I known that, I would have brought the one I caught a few days ago to battle him!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 15.ogg Arataki Itto: Hey, you want to hang out with humans, right? I totally get that.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 16.ogg Arataki Itto: After all, we youkai are becoming a rare breed these days. If all we do is isolate, we'll only feel more lonely. So, why don't you let this oni do ya a favor, hmm?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 17.ogg Arataki Itto: See, I'm a youkai too, right, and I'm already a natural in human society. I bet there's not a single person in Inazuma who hasn't heard of Arataki "The One and Oni" Itto!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 itto 18.ogg Arataki Itto: Hahaha! C'mon, let's go! I'll show you around!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 kappa 01.ogg ???: Seriously, why didn't you run when I told you?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 kappa 02.ogg Kappa: Well, we recognized you right away! You're an oni, aren't you?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 kappa 03.ogg Kappa: No, we weren't trying to scare anyone. We were just trying to, uh...
Media:vo sdeq002 57 kappa 04.ogg Kappa: Mm-hmm. You see, we live in the wilderness and are frequently attacked by monsters.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 kappa 05.ogg Kappa: They would come and stir up trouble on our land, forcing us to hand over our food... Sometimes they would even get rough and leave us injured.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 kappa 06.ogg Kappa: But later, many human adventurers came into the wilderness and drove off the monsters, allowing us to live in peace.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 kappa 07.ogg Kappa: We have no idea what could have gone wrong!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 kappa 08.ogg Kappa: Later, a human man with blue hair appeared and walked around the area...
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow Itto, you really captured them!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Who said we were going to eat you? Wait, are you the ghosts of something tasty?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: And Itto, why're you so quiet all of a sudden?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Aha, so it was you three!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Even though you scared the daylights out of Paimon a few times, it doesn't seem like you were doing it on purpose.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Anyway, let's hear your side of the story and Paimon will decide whether or not to forgive you!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Ah, the festival that Ei mentioned!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Huh? Gratitude? What do you mean?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: So are you the ones who set up the Akitsu Yuugei game on the beach?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Is the Akitsu Yuugei really that important? Why did you spend all of your youkai power to build it?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Paimon would have taken (Traveler) for a big meal if you had set up more food stalls!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: "A human man with blue hair"...?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Now that you mention it, the fan that Ayato chose is the same kind that's used at a festival... Do you think that he knew about the youkai when he decided to hold the Test of Courage here?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Wow, Itto's still clueless about who Ayato really is...
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Well anyway, seems like all the strange things we saw earlier were caused by these little youkai, not ghosts. What a relief...
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: And now that we know what was happening, the Test of Courage doesn't seem that scary after all!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Now that Paimon doesn't feel so scared anymore, maybe we can walk around the area?
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: The youkai said they wanted to host a festival, but Paimon was too busy having the bejeebers scared out of her to pay any attention until now.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: Come to think of it, Paimon remembers seeing some festival-related items on the beach... Let's head over there and take a look. Maybe we can help out!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 01.ogg ???: What're you saying... We couldn't abandon you!
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 02.ogg Youko: It sure took you long enough to notice.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 03.ogg Youko: ...
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 04.ogg Youko: Ahem, well, the truth is... we were planning a festival.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 05.ogg Youko: One hosted by the youkai, but humans are also welcome to attend.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 06.ogg Youko: Yes, the Mikawa Flower Festival is our aspiration... But we know that our festival doesn't deserve that name.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 07.ogg Youko: The times of Hyakkiyakou are long gone, we're just a bunch of little youkai living in the wilderness.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 08.ogg Youko: As you can see, we lack the necessary youkai powers to put on such a grand festival.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 09.ogg Youko: But... we're determined to still reach out to humans and express our gratitude.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 10.ogg Youko: We were just following you to see your reactions.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 11.ogg Youko: To be honest, we've never met a human before, so we had no idea what you would like...
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 12.ogg Youko: We focused on building the Akitsu Yuugei because of a legend we heard.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 13.ogg Youko: It's the story of youkai meeting a human during a festival hundreds of years ago.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 14.ogg Youko: The Mikawa Flower Festival is meant to bring happiness to all who attend, and Akitsu Hazura is a symbol of friendship.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 15.ogg Youko: That's why, when we decided to hold the festival here, setting up Akitsu Hazura was our first priority.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 16.ogg Youko: Unfortunately, the real Akitsu Hazura has been lost to time. What we created is a version of the game we heard about from a wandering merchant, so we changed the name to Akitsu Yuugei.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 17.ogg Youko: We closed Akitsu Yuugei a while ago and carefully checked it for any issues.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 18.ogg Youko: But, we didn't find anything wrong with it... Maybe it was just some strange mishap caused by our unstable youkai power at the time.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 19.ogg Youko: He had a piercing gaze, I almost felt like he could see us.
Media:vo sdeq002 57 youko 20.ogg Youko: But then he turned and quickly left without saying anything.
Media:vo sdeq002 58 chizuru 01.ogg ???: ...Oh, it's you two again.
Media:vo sdeq002 58 chizuru 02.ogg ???: I have to say, I'm impressed by your willingness to approach me after last time. You're much braver than I thought.
Media:vo sdeq002 58 chizuru 03.ogg ???: But I'm not going to let you off the hook so easily this time. If you don't leave, I'llâ€”
Media:vo sdeq002 58 chizuru 04.ogg ???: Huh? Fellow youkai?
Media:vo sdeq002 58 chizuru 05.ogg ???: Akitsu Yuugei, again that game...
Media:vo sdeq002 58 chizuru 06.ogg ???: How could this be happening now? All I needed was a little more time, and I could...!
Media:vo sdeq002 58 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wait! You're the strange lady we met before!
Media:vo sdeq002 58 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmph! Nice try, but you don't scare us anymore!
Media:vo sdeq002 58 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We just met your fellow youkai, and they told us everything!
Media:vo sdeq002 58 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: That's right! You're another little youkai who lives in the wilderness, aren't you? We just met Youko, Kappa, and Hitotsume Kozou!
Media:vo sdeq002 58 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So which type of youkai are you? Let Paimon guess... uh... hmm, actually Paimon has no idea what you are!
Media:vo sdeq002 58 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Anyway, it doesn't matter. We're on our way to play Akitsu Yuugei, care to join us?
Media:vo sdeq002 58 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Huh? What's the matter? Are you not feeling well?
Media:vo sdeq002 58 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Oh! Maybe you're hungry? Or maybe you didn't sleep well? You look pretty exhausted.
Media:vo sdeq002 58 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Don't worry. Itto has already taken your fellow youkai to meet some new friends! Everyone will get along just fine.
Media:vo sdeq002 58 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Yeah, so there's no need to worry. C'mon, let's go play Akitsu Yuugei!
Media:vo sdeq002 58 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: We'll see who can finish the game the quickest. The loser will have to grant the winner a wish!
Media:vo sdeq002 58 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Oh, it's starting! Get ready!
Media:vo sdeq002 59 chizuru 01.ogg ???: ...Okay, watch and learn.
Media:vo sdeq002 59 chizuru 02.ogg ???: Even if the rules have changed a little, I would never lose to amateurs like you.
Media:vo sdeq002 59 chizuru 03.ogg ???: A wish, huh? Then I wish...
Media:vo sdeq002 59 chizuru 04.ogg ???: ...that we never cross paths again.
Media:vo sdeq002 59 chizuru 05.ogg ???: That's precisely why...
Media:vo sdeq002 59 chizuru 06.ogg ???: Don't ever come near me or speak to me again.
Media:vo sdeq002 59 chizuru 07.ogg ???: Surely that's a wish you can fulfill, right?
Media:vo sdeq002 59 chizuru 08.ogg ???: This is my final word of warning. If I ever see your faces again, I will, uh... I'll steal your souls!
Media:vo sdeq002 59 chizuru 09.ogg ???: Scared now? Good, then don't come here again!
(??? leaves)
Media:vo sdeq002 59 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Amazing! You cleared all the elemental cubes so quickly.
Media:vo sdeq002 59 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hehe, Paimon thinks we got this in the bag! Alright, it's your turn.
Media:vo sdeq002 59 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: No way, she hit every cube in one shot and finished even faster than you, (Traveler)!
Media:vo sdeq002 59 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Uh, Paimon's head is spinning after watching that! Did you see how she did it?
Media:vo sdeq002 59 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh right, you're a youkai... You're the ones who created Akitsu Yuugei.
Media:vo sdeq002 59 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: No wonder you were so good... Anyway, we'll keep our word; you can make a wish now.
Media:vo sdeq002 59 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: But before you say anything, we won't do anything that's clearly impossible or harmful to others.
Media:vo sdeq002 59 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Wait, what? But didn't we just have a great time together?
Media:vo sdeq002 59 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Uhh, Paimon doesn't get it... Did we do something wrong?
Media:vo sdeq002 59 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Fair enough... But Paimon had a lot of fun playing Akitsu Yuugei with her! It would be great if we could see her again.
Media:vo sdeq002 59 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Anyway, let's go see how Itto's doing!
Media:vo sdeq002 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Thoma! Wait, were you also a contestant in the first round?
Media:vo sdeq002 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmm, is there a chance he wasn't there to cause trouble? Maybe he was just trying to scare people.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon remembers you once mentioned that you like kaidan...
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Hey there! Congrats on winning the first round of the Test of Courage.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 02.ogg Thoma: I sure was! But I couldn't shake this constant feeling that someone was secretly following me the entire round.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 03.ogg Thoma: He didn't seem to be from the Yashiro Commission, and I was concerned that he might be out to stir up trouble at the event, so I tried to capture him.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 04.ogg Thoma: I didn't expect him to run so fast. I gave chase for a while, but I couldn't keep up... and before I knew it, the round was over.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 05.ogg Thoma: Coming all the way to the Test of Courage to scare people? Well, I guess the world is full of all kinds of weirdos...
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 06.ogg Thoma: Anyway, I'm gonna be sure to show everyone my abilities in the second round.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 07.ogg Thoma: Yeah, that's right. Once I really get into it, you might find me to be your toughest competitor.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 08.ogg Thoma: Haha, I'm only kidding, of course. I'm not here for the prizes, just to have fun.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 09.ogg Thoma: My lord has granted me a rare vacation, so I'd rather spend my time relaxing than worrying about some contest.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 10.ogg Thoma: Speaking of which, have you found a partner yet? Would you like to pair up with me?
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 11a 1.ogg Thoma: Really? Thank you.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 11a 2.ogg Thoma: I can't guarantee we'll be able to win the second round, but I'll do my best to help. Let's give it our best shot!
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 11b 1.ogg Thoma: Ah, I understand. Hope you can find the right partner and win the second round.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 11b 2.ogg Thoma: You've probably already heard that to win the Grand Narukami Shrine's special prize. You have to win all three rounds.
Media:vo sdeq002 6 thoma 11b 3.ogg Thoma: I'd like to know what the prize is as well... And you're the only one who has that chance now, so go for it!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 akira 01.ogg Akira: Yeah, the Test of Courage is terrifying! Thâ€”There are definitely ghosts here!!!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: There's no need to be so formal...
Media:vo sdeq002 60 genta 01.ogg Genta: I still get shivers just thinking about it... But the thrill was kinda fun...
Media:vo sdeq002 60 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Hey, don't you want to go talk to them, too?
Media:vo sdeq002 60 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Really? That's strange, you seemed completely fine when we were chatting.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: It's okay. You can't excel at everything. The important thing is to have the courage to change.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: What's all the noise about?
Media:vo sdeq002 60 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: There's nothing to fear. Even if there really is a ghost, all your noise would drive it away.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Itto, you and your gang should go and inform the other contestants about the situation.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: (Traveler), Paimon, please come with me.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 hitotsumekozou 01.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: Yâ€”Yes!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 hitotsumekozou 02.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: Oh...! I once saw some Naganohara fireworks... Even though I was watching from a distance, they were still so beautiful, bursting across the sky...
Media:vo sdeq002 60 hitotsumekozou 03.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: Wow, really? Thank you very much... And, if I may ask, are you Lord Kaedehara Kazuha?
Media:vo sdeq002 60 hitotsumekozou 04.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: I've seen you with your sword in the wilderness... You made quick work of many opponents with your amazing swordsmanship.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 hitotsumekozou 05.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: Oh, so yâ€”you must be the one and only Shirasagi Himegimi? What an honor...
Media:vo sdeq002 60 hitotsumekozou 06.ogg Hitotsume Kozou: I never imagined I'd ever meet someone as distinguished as you! I must be dreaming...!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Hahaha! It's nothing! Being the "The One and Oni" means being the best, you know.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 02.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh â€” I should mention that, uh, I even have my own gang, and every member has a special title!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 03.ogg Arataki Itto: Hey! This is my moment, Paimon! Don't ruin it for me!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 04.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh yeah!? Alright, well then let's have a little contest and see who knows the most people!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 05.ogg Arataki Itto: Haha, well, of courseâ€”
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 06.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh, it's the boys!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 07.ogg Arataki Itto: Darn it! I was so caught up with the youkai that I forgot I was supposed to scare the daylights outta the gang!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 08.ogg Arataki Itto: Ahem... hey fellas, look, I can explain, Iâ€”
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 09.ogg Arataki Itto: Wait, what now?
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 10.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh... uh... hahaha well, I told you it would be an exhilarating experience, but noooo, none of you believed me.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 11.ogg Arataki Itto: Anyway, no need to be too scared now. Let me tell you what's happening here...
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 12.ogg Arataki Itto: It turns out, there aren't any ghosts here, all the scary stuff you saw was just a little misunderstanding we had with the youkai.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 13.ogg Arataki Itto: Right?
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 14.ogg Arataki Itto: Huh?
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 15.ogg Arataki Itto: Hâ€”Hold on, little Youko... You're kidding, right? You know, now's really not the time for that!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 16.ogg Arataki Itto: But if it wasn't you guys... does that mean there are real ghosts out here!?
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 17.ogg Arataki Itto: Calm down! Everyone jâ€”just calm down now!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 18.ogg Arataki Itto: Hmm? Oh, you're the Tenryou Commission's...
Media:vo sdeq002 60 itto 19.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh... Okay!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 kappa 01.ogg Kappa: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm rather shy...
Media:vo sdeq002 60 kappa 02.ogg Kappa: I'm not sure why, but I feel so relaxed when talking with you, General Gorou.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 kappa 03.ogg Kappa: Actually, I'm the most timid of the three of us. I hid for days the last time someone tossed a stone into the river...
Media:vo sdeq002 60 kappa 04.ogg Kappa: Ah! Sorry for rambling on. It's odd... I'm not normally like this...
Media:vo sdeq002 60 kappa 05.ogg Kappa: Hâ€”Hello there.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, that's me, but I'm afraid that I'm no lord... just a wandering samurai.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Ah, that must have been when I was trying to escape Inazuma... It wasn't as impressive as you make it seem. I had to face many trying situations before I was able to leave the islands.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: The head of the Kamisato Clan also lent me his assistance at the time. By the way, this is his sister.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 mamoru 01.ogg Mamoru: Boss!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 mamoru 02.ogg Mamoru: We shouldn't have ever doubted you, Boss. You were right!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Classic Itto... There you go, bragging about yourself... again!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Don't confuse them! Everyone's here for the Test of Courage, not because you brought them here! Half the people here don't even know who you are!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hehe, Itto really isn't as cool as he claims to be.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: When it comes to having connections in Inazuma, nobody can beat Paimon and (Traveler)!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Sure! Bring it on, Bull-Chucker Beetle Boy!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Huh?
Media:vo sdeq002 60 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Ah, that's right! Paimon assumed she was a youkai too, and we even played Akitsu Yuugei with her.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Ah! So she was a ghost?
Media:vo sdeq002 60 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Heizou!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Phew... Paimon somehow feels a little better now that Heizou's here...
Media:vo sdeq002 60 sayu 01.ogg Sayu: I've never seen a Kappa before.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 thoma 01.ogg Thoma: Hey there, chatting away I see... Mind if I join you?
Media:vo sdeq002 60 together 01.ogg Mamoru, Akira, and Genta: Boss!!!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 together 02.ogg Mamoru, Akira, and Genta: Boss, we're sorry!!!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 together 03.ogg Mamoru, Akira, and Genta: Ah, Boss! Save us!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: So you must be Hitotsume Kozou!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: Hehe, no need to be nervous. I'm Yoimiya, and I run Naganohara Fireworks.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: Really? Then the next time we meet, I'll bring some fireworks for us to launch together! It'll be fun!
Media:vo sdeq002 60 youko 01.ogg Youko: Thank you for bringing so many amazing people to meet us, Itto.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 youko 02.ogg Youko: Ahem... please don't fight. Actually, I think you're both really amazing.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 youko 03.ogg Youko: And you also have a great friendship. Just like Lord Kamai and the samurai...
Media:vo sdeq002 60 youko 04.ogg Youko: Ah... Sorry, but I've never seen these three before.
Media:vo sdeq002 60 youko 05.ogg Youko: I'm not sure where you've been or what you've seen, but I don't think it had anything to do with us...
Media:vo sdeq002 60 youko 06.ogg Youko: Nâ€”No, I'm serious. I really don't know what's going on...
Media:vo sdeq002 60 youko 07.ogg Youko: ...
Media:vo sdeq002 60 youko 08.ogg Youko: *gulp* Iâ€”I'm not sure who it was you met...
Media:vo sdeq002 60 youko 09.ogg Youko: But we're the only three youkai who wanted to hold a festival here...
Media:vo sdeq002 68 heizou 01.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The shrine maiden appears to be urging us to finish the third round of the Test of Courage.
Media:vo sdeq002 68 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The words are scribbled hastily, but there's no evidence of a struggle. However... aren't there too many words written here?

Media:vo sdeq002 68 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Waaaah! What's this? Look, there's something written in red on the bulletin board!
Media:vo sdeq002 68 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: "Round 3... Item... Hagoita."
Media:vo sdeq002 68 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Does this mean that the item we have to find in the third round is a hagoita?

Media:vo sdeq002 68 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Let's worry about that later. The bigger question is, are we really going to join the third round of the Test of Courage?

Sayu - Mujina Ninja
Sayu, a ninja of the Shuumatsuban, is a petite figure skilled at skiving.
She is well-trained in many arts of concealment and covering her tracks, and she uses these to evade work and look for places to nap during the day.
The lady of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, Kamisato Ayaka. Dignified and elegant, intelligent and tenacious.
The present owner of Naganohara Fireworks. Hero to the children, Queen of the Summer Festival â€” also known as Yoimiya.
This is because she often represents the Yashiro Commission as it conducts affairs among the common folk.
This is not laziness, of course! Rather, she is simply spending time on more important matters, such as sleeping more, so that she can grow taller... Or at least, that's how Sayu would rationalize things.

Yoimiya - Frolicking Flames
Yoimiya's heart has yet to lose its childlike innocence, and she often plays simple but evergreen games with the children, or goes with them to find some shiny objects. The purity of these children brings her great happiness.
You watch as the lady finishes the game in record speed.

Youko: How to drive away the human
Youko: It's said that long ago
Youko: The speaker appeared to be a prominent figure among the youkai
Youko: The two competed in the highlight of the festival: the Akitsu Hazura (Haneasobi)
