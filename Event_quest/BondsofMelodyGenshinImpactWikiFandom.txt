Bennett - Trial by Fire
Young Bennett is one of the most passionate adventurers in Mondstadt. He is also by far the least fortunate...
So infamous is his bad luck that other adventurers are rarely willing to team up with him. Yet Bennett has grown used to being alone and doesn't let it discourage him. No matter how many injuries he may suffer, his fiery passion for adventure burns on.
Come on, there's treasure waiting up ahead in the unknown! Benny's Adventure Team, assemble!

Klee - Fleeing Sunlight
Spark Knight Klee of the Knights of Favonius, reporting for duty!
Inquisitive, enthusiastic, and innocent, this little knight is a ball of laughs to be around.
Though she does often get herself into some trouble, but is playfulness not the purview of young children?
Now, take a guess: is Klee currently planning to go out for an adventure, or is she going to Starfell Lake for some fish blasting?
Whichever the case, she'd best be careful, or the monster of the confinement room is going to catch her!

(If the player has not met Rosaria yet, an introductory note appears on screen)
Rosaria - Thorny Benevolence
Rosaria is a sister of the Church of Favonius, but you wouldn't know it except for her attire.
You certainly won't find her saying prayers or attending Church gatherings. If you need to find this elusive sister for any reason, then you might be looking for quite a while.
Check the hidden corners in the shadows, and you might just find Rosaria quietly observing the rapid changes around Mondstadt. Though everything about her seems mysterious, this sister is in fact guarding Mondstadt, just in her own way.
 ...Hard to say.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 06b 1.ogg Rosaria: I get it. In the final moments of your life, the people there with you won't necessarily be your blood relatives.
 Actually, we're here about Razor...
 Ah, the memories...
 Be careful.
 But it's normal to be curious.
 Definitely time to take a break...
 Great job, Razor.
 Hello, Klee, and Razor.
 I enjoyed it as well.
 I still have to look for ingredients with Razor...
 I think the bond of blood is a strong one.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 06a 1a.ogg Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 06a 1b.ogg Rosaria: Ah, I almost forgot. You have a (sister/brother).
 It doesn't help during the day.
 It makes me think of the Knights of Favonius.
 It'll take some time, there's no need to rush it.
 It's a plan then.
 Just gathering some reference material.
 Keep your eyes peeled on the road.
 Leave it to us.
 Let's find more people to speak to.
 Let's wait and see.
 Lisa, you're a godsend. Thank you.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 14b 1.ogg Lisa: Well, aren't you a sweet one? But this is as much my business as yours. It's my pleasure, really.
 Maybe an information overload.
 Maybe they aren't the "ingredients"...
 Maybe they describe the wine's "character"...
 Obviously that's not what he meant.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 paimon 02a 1.ogg Paimon: Oh... F—Fair enough...
 Perhaps he did... as a way of helping us to help Razor.
 Phew, so bomb crisis averted...
 Quest DescriptionRazor decides to make some Thousand-Wind Wine personally to better understand his human parents. However, which ingredients, specifically, was Venti's song referring to?
 Seems entirely reasonable to me.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 paimon 02b 1.ogg Paimon: Is your brain half-asleep or something? It doesn't make any sense at all!
 Some questions, he can't stop thinking about.
 Sounds more like something you'd do than Razor.
 Step DescriptionBefore the last brewing material is ready, you decide to follow Kaeya to Dawn Winery to help Razor find a suitable barrel.
 Thank you for your hospitality.
 That would be a "Suspicious Thousand-Wind Wine"...
 The Adventurers' Guild, the Church of Favonius...
 The more the merrier.
 The urge to know is understandable.
 They're still waiting for you at the festival.
 To be fair, they only glow at night...
 We need a barrel...
 We'll wait for you.
 What a guy.
 What a trooper...
 What is it, Razor?
 Why don't you two go adventuring together?
 Yes... And as for the word "defender"...
 You could say that.
 You seem a little...

Klee - Fleeing Sunlight
Media:vo dialog jnjeq002 adelinde 01.ogg Adelinde: It's been a long time since I last saw Masters Diluc and Kaeya sharing a meal together. The atmosphere was... ahem, was not something that a maid of my lowly stature should be commenting on.
Media:vo dialog jnjeq002 adelinde 02.ogg Adelinde: (Traveler), thank you so much for visiting. I hope to see you again soon.
Media:vo dialog jnjeq002 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Family, huh...
Media:vo dialog jnjeq002 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: ...
Media:vo dialog jnjeq002 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Don't mind me. You should probably head back and get some rest.
Media:vo dialog jnjeq002 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: I'm not the most familiar with Razor, but you can contact me if you ever need help.
Media:vo dialog jnjeq002 lisa 01.ogg Lisa: Aw, alright. I'll teach you a very special magic trick that can make all your troubles disappear in the blink of an eye.
Media:vo dialog jnjeq002 lisa 02.ogg Lisa: But before we do that, let's warm up with something a little bit easier, hmm? Let's practice some talking.
Media:vo dialog jnjeq002 lisa 03.ogg Lisa: That way, the next time somebody helps you, or you have a different opinion from the rest of the group, you'll be able to express what you think clearly and precisely.
Media:vo dialog jnjeq002 marcel 01.ogg Marcel: We're going through a ton of fruit this Weinlesefest... I really need that cart to get here safely.
Media:vo dialog jnjeq002 razor 01.ogg Razor: My heart, feels like, rotten berries. So sour.
Media:vo dialog jnjeq002 razor 02.ogg Razor: I don't understand what I should do...
Media:vo dialog jnjeq002 razor 03.ogg Razor: Okay!
Media:vo dialog jnjeq002 razor 04.ogg Razor: I will do my best.
Media:vo jnjeq002 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's almost time. Let's go meet up with Razor!
Media:vo jnjeq002 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: The meeting spot is on the bank of Cider Lake. You know the way, right?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: *panting* Razor... Razor... finally, I found you.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Oh, haha, look who's here! Hey, everyone.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: Here, this is for you.

Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: Yup, that's right. I tripped up on it this morning and took a little tumble.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: I did a full faceplant, but somehow, this little thing came out completely unscathed. That's when I knew it was destined to go into your wine mix!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: Haha, ah, I was just running too fast and got careless, I guess.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: (Okay, I guess maybe I won't tell them about the other faceplants that came after that...)
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: Anyway, I've been all over the place trying to find Razor this morning. Everyone I asked told me I'd just missed him.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: Good thing I've caught up now, I can finally catch my breath...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: Thanks, (Traveler).
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 11.ogg Bennett: Oh, that? Yeah, interesting story.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 12.ogg Bennett: This lady came to see Master Cyrus, asking for the Adventurers' Guild's support with the Weinlesefest. Said she was the librarian. Anyway, she mentioned your situation too, and asked if we could help...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 13.ogg Bennett: Ohhh! So that was Lisa? People say she's crazy intelligent but just doesn't go out much... First time I've ever seen her.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 14.ogg Bennett: I thought long and hard about what ingredients to pick, and came up with a load of suggestions that I was gonna discuss with you...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 15.ogg Bennett: But then I realized that Small Lamp Grass was clearly the best. It shines a light to guide the way for explorers in the dark. Doesn't that sound like a wonderful thing?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 16.ogg Bennett: Ahh, don't gimme that! I get how you must be feeling about all of this. Besides, you gotta help out your friends, right?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 17.ogg Bennett: If my family... uh, well, my dads ever needed help one day, I know you'd be there for me too.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 18.ogg Bennett: Ahh, haha, well that's because I never met my parents. I was raised by some of the older adventurers in the guild. So we're not exactly a typical family.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 19.ogg Bennett: But if you do want to hear about them, I can tell you some of my dads' stories. Hmm... okay, I'll start with the most awesome one.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 20.ogg Bennett: ...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 21.ogg Bennett: I really appreciate the thought, Klee. But I'm afraid I can't accept your offer...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 22.ogg Bennett: I already have my dads and all my friends... And let's not forget that I'm the leader of Benny's Adventure Team. You don't need to worry about me.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 23.ogg Bennett: ...Are you sure?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 24.ogg Bennett: Cool, don't worry about a thing! We'll look after each other.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 bennett 25.ogg Bennett: See ya later, folks.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 01a.ogg Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 01b.ogg Klee: (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight! Paimon!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 02.ogg Klee: They let me out for Weinlesefest!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 03.ogg Klee: Albedo is super busy helping Timaeus fix his recipe for an Extra-Strong Sobriety Potion, so he doesn't have time to come play with me right now. I'm just playing by myself instead.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 04.ogg Klee: But it's so cool! All the grown-ups in Mondstadt are out to celebrate the festival. Everyone's smiling and having loads of fun!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 05.ogg Klee: I wanted to join in too. So I made a whole bunch of stuff so I can celebrate with everyone in my very own way!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 06.ogg Klee: And that's when I bumped into Razor.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 07.ogg Klee: Razor was acting kinda different than usual, like he was thinking about something. So I asked him, "What happened?"
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 08.ogg Klee: And then Razor said that he was looking for his mommy!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 09.ogg Klee: It's okay, silly! Mommies are important people, so finding your mommy is a super important job. That's why Klee's gonna come help!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 10.ogg Klee: Bennett, how did you manage to trip up on a Small Lamp Grass?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 11.ogg Klee: No, no, I wasn't talking about the glowing. What I meant was, they're really big and easy to spot. So I don't get how you didn't see it.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 12.ogg Klee: Can I help, too? Please, take me with you, pleeease! I wanna join in!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 13.ogg Klee: Aw, Bennett...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 14.ogg Klee: You can be Mommy's kid, just like Klee! My mom is super nice — she'll take great care of you!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 15.ogg Klee: Oh, okay. I got it. Um, then have this.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 16.ogg Klee: Yeah! It's a lazy, dopey Jumpy Dumpty that always dozes and never explodes! I hope you guys can be best friends.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 17.ogg Klee: Yep! Jumpy Dumpty will be happy to make a new friend, too.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 18.ogg Klee: Yay! Adventure! Treasure! Weinlesefest! Let's go, let's go!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 19a.ogg Media:vo jnjeq002 2 klee 19b.ogg Klee: Oh... wait, but what about Wolfie? Wolfie— uh, I mean Razor needs looking after. Honorary Knight, Paimon, you'd better take care of Razor, okay? Make sure he finds his mommy.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 marcel 01.ogg Marcel: Excuse me, I couldn't help but overhear that you're about to head back into the city. Is that right?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 marcel 02.ogg Marcel: I'm waiting on a fruit cart from the city. It should be here now, but... I'm getting worried that something may have happened on the way, but I can't leave the festival to check up on it...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 marcel 03.ogg Marcel: Would you be able to do me a huge favor, and keep an eye out for the cart on your way back?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 marcel 04.ogg Marcel: That's wonderful, thank you so much!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? Where's the heck's Razor? Paimon thought he would've been here by now...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmm, he had a pretty big day when we last saw him... Do you think he fell asleep when he got back and is still snoozing away now?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Fair enough, you're right. Let's keep waiting.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Well, since we've got some time on our hands, let's put our heads together and try to figure out that poem! Tone-Deaf Bard mentioned some ingredients, but they all sounded super abstract:
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: An explorer's courage, a love tender and true, a defender's will, and... the thousand winds'... "song of good cheer"...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Do you have any ideas?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Yeesh, that's even more abstract! How do we go about looking for this wine's "character"? Where do we start?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Huh? Are you saying that it has something to do with Mondstadt's institutions?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Wow, that... actually makes a surprising amount of sense. So the poem wasn't talking about any specific ingredients after all? More like... the general gist?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Now that you mention it, it just so happens that all the institutions you mentioned are organizers of the Weinlesefest!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: ...Wait, this is way too big of a coincidence! That Tone-Deaf Bard, did he just make this all up on the spot!?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: In that case, the last part about the thousand winds' song of cheer must be code for the toasting ceremony! Ohoho, now we're cookin'! We'll crack your riddle-recipe yet, Tone-Deaf Bard!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: When Razor gets here, let's visit all the places you mentioned and talk to some people we know there. We definitely should be able to find some more clues that way.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: That's alright, we were just chatting.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 15a.ogg Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 15b.ogg Paimon: (Traveler)'s pretty smart, so thanks to (him/her), we're finally onto something!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: "Very own way"... Uh oh, this does not bode well coming from Klee.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Uh... a Small Lamp Grass?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Huh, that's true. They do glow, after all...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: Whoa, Lisa is doing some real work for once?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: Klee's in high spirits today. She seems more excited by this festival than anyone.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 21.ogg Paimon: Huh!?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 22.ogg Paimon: A Jumpy Dumpty?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 23.ogg Paimon: Good idea. Maybe Klee will bring Bennett some good luck, and the adventure will go smoothly. And you might just find some treasures you've never noticed before!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 24.ogg Paimon: Of course... It's also highly possible that Klee will be the only one who gets lucky...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 25.ogg Paimon: Still, on the flip side, Klee won't be getting into any trouble with Bennett there. And this way, she'll still get to enjoy the Weinlesefest!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 26.ogg Paimon: Ah, it's so nice to see everyone in such a good mood.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 27.ogg Paimon: Oh...! Paimon almost forgot the whole reason we came here!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 28.ogg Paimon: Razor, (Traveler) and Paimon were just chatting about the ingredients Venti mentioned in his poem. We think that they're actually a description of the wine's characteristics.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 29.ogg Paimon: Plus, it seems like each of them means something special to one of the three big institutions in Mondstadt. So, if we talk to some people we know at each place, maybe we'll find what you're looking for.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 30.ogg Paimon: What's wrong? Something on your mind? Do you want to talk about it?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 31.ogg Paimon: That's great! Keep at it, and you'll definitely find the answer eventually.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 32.ogg Paimon: Yeah! We should head back into the city. Let's find a friendly face at the Church of Favonius!
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 33.ogg Paimon: Hmm, now who does Razor know best at the church...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 paimon 34.ogg Paimon: Ummm... Well, if it's on the way...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 01.ogg Razor: I'm sorry! I'm late...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 02.ogg Razor: Hi. I was on my way, then I saw Klee.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 03.ogg Razor: I did not say mommy.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 04.ogg Razor: ...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 05.ogg Razor: Bennett?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 06.ogg Razor: How did you know... I need ingredients?
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 07.ogg Razor: ...Apologies... for the trouble.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 08.ogg Razor: Yes.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 09.ogg Razor: Bennett, before now... you never talk about your family.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 10.ogg Razor: I... also happy for you.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 11.ogg Razor: Mm...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 12.ogg Razor: ...Good luck.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 13.ogg Razor: Hmm...
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 14.ogg Razor: Yes. These days, I think a lot.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 15.ogg Razor: I am not... smart. Not like teacher, not like (Traveler). But... I still have to think.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 16.ogg Razor: Everyone is ready to help, but... some things, I must do myself.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 17.ogg Razor: I don't understand human father and mother... but I must find a way to understand.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 18.ogg Razor: Maybe I can learn about other people's father and mother first, then think about my own father and mother.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 19.ogg Razor: That's why I want to ask questions.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 20.ogg Razor: Never knew Bennett is... like me.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 21.ogg Razor: When he talks about "dads," his scent changes.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 22.ogg Razor: Warm, like a bed of straw in the sun.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 23.ogg Razor: Okay, we go. I go too.
Media:vo jnjeq002 2 razor 24.ogg Razor: Everyone helps me. Now I have chance, to help everyone.
Media:vo jnjeq002 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh! Paimon sees the cart, but what are these hilichurls doing here!? Do they want some fresh fruit now, too?
Media:vo jnjeq002 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: (Traveler), to the rescue!
Media:vo jnjeq002 3 razor 01.ogg Razor: *sniff*... This way.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whew, finally. These hilichurls are a little too obsessed with food for their own good... But never mind that, are you okay? Did they hurt you?
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Rosaria! What the heck are you doing here?
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wait... Actually, turning up at random places is pretty normal for you...
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Okay, next question: What the heck do you mean "brother and sister"?
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Brother and sister...? Varka...?
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Oh! Paimon gets it. Varka is a father figure to both of them, so that makes them family — just not by blood.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Whew, Rosaria's take is a little on the nose... That's a hard one for Razor to answer.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Wow, Rosaria...
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: But can we really use a Mist Flower? Won't it freeze the entire barrel?
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Aw, Rosaria, you're more thoughtful than Paimon realized...
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: ...Uh, wait, you heard the bard say that? Were you spying on us!?
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Now you see her, now you don't... Paimon's slowly getting used to her style.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Oh well, as "love tender and true" goes, that was pretty awkward, but... still counts, right? Now all that's left is the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Razor, are you still thinking about what Rosaria said?
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 01.ogg Razor: ...
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 02.ogg Razor: Mm.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 03.ogg Razor: Enemy following.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 04.ogg Razor: ...
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 05.ogg Razor: It's okay. I will wait.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 06.ogg Razor: Cold, dark grown-up... You also don't remember what your real mother and real father look like?
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 07.ogg Razor: No! You are wrong about this.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 08.ogg Razor: Lupical protect each other. Human family also important. Must care about them.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 09.ogg Razor: Ummm...
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 10.ogg Razor: Thank you...
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 11.ogg Razor: ...
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 12.ogg Razor: Her words, are like Mist Flower. They are cold, and they sting.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 13.ogg Razor: But cold also good for wounds. Like Wolfhook.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 14.ogg Razor: I need to, think about it. Maybe then, I will understand.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 15.ogg Razor: Okay.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 razor 16.ogg Razor: I will come with you. I think while we walk.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rolf 01.ogg Rolf: Phew... I'm fine, thanks to you. You were just in time. Any later, and all you'd have found here is a pile of pulp... and I don't think there'd be much left of the fruit, either.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rolf 02.ogg Rolf: Got it. Well, thanks again! I'd better not delay this delivery any longer, so goodbye and Happy Weinlesefest!
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rolf 03.ogg Rolf: Thanks to you, too, kiddo.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 01.ogg Rosaria: "Enemy"? Heh, I think we're a little closer than that.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 02.ogg Rosaria: On some level, you could even say that we're brother and sister.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 03.ogg Rosaria: Varka taught you how to use that sword, I take it? Swift but powerful. Heh, I can spot that old-timer's style anywhere.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 04.ogg Rosaria: I see you're not much of a talker. Well, there's something else you could learn from Varka. Never lost for words, even when he has nothing to say... It'd be good conversation practice for you. Just a shame we have no idea when he'll be back.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 05.ogg Rosaria: Well, blood relations are overrated anyway, don't you think?
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 06a 1a.ogg Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 06a 1b.ogg Rosaria: Ah, I almost forgot. You have a (sister/brother).
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 06b 1.ogg Rosaria: I get it. In the final moments of your life, the people there with you won't necessarily be your blood relatives.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 07.ogg Rosaria: Huh... So you're helping him dig up some info on his biological parents? And trying to help him build a concept of family along the way?
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 08.ogg Rosaria: Alright, you got me.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 09.ogg Rosaria: I barely have any memories of my birth parents... The last time I saw them was long before I had any understanding of the world around me.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 10.ogg Rosaria: But that seems pretty common. Even in this day and age, there are plenty of people in the world who can't stop thinking about their families, but will never get to see them.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 11.ogg Rosaria: Anyway, if you're never gonna meet someone, it's not worth spending mental energy on them. It's more important to focus on the kind of person you want to become.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 12.ogg Rosaria: ...Fine. So let's say you do find out who your parents were, and they were saints. Or the opposite, they were complete monsters. What then?
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 13.ogg Rosaria: How would that affect your life choices? What would you do about it?
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 14.ogg Rosaria: Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to make this any more difficult than it already is. But Razor's feeling lost and confused right now, and all the other Mondstadters we know are too sunny and bright to tell it like it really is...
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 15.ogg Rosaria: ...The sun nurtures many good things, but it can't do anything about the problems lurking in the shadows.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 16.ogg Rosaria: Alright, I'll leave it there. Take this flower, it's icy cold — just like me.

Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 17.ogg Rosaria: Barbara's busy preparing the sung poetry event for the Weinlesefest. She couldn't get away, so I picked an ingredient out on behalf of the church.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 18.ogg Rosaria: No, not now that I've dealt with it. The bard did say to think "freedom," didn't he? So go on, take it. It won't be a problem.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 19.ogg Rosaria: Don't mention it. It's nothing. Varka's been a big help to me in the past, so just consider it returning a favor. Besides... if I'm your older sister, I might as well act like it.
Media:vo jnjeq002 4 rosaria 20.ogg Rosaria: Good luck finding your answers.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Oho, just in time. Lisa and I were just talking about Razor's situation.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Where were we... Ah, yes, the barrel!
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: *sigh* Alright, spare me the flattery, Lisa. We're all friends here, and I know you're only trying to help your student.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: ...But I haven't been back there in a long time. This could be quite difficult to accomplish in just a single trip.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Hmm... I suppose. Alright, I'll head out right away.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Splendid. I was just thinking about how nice it would be to have some company on my trip.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 01.ogg Lisa: ...So you see, you're the best person for this.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 02.ogg Lisa: Hehe... Oh, Paimon, don't worry, you'll get your ingredient. I've already tasked someone with sorting it out.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 03.ogg Lisa: The person is very conscientious, and wants to properly research their contribution. So it may take some time, but hopefully it'll be worth the wait.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 04.ogg Lisa: As for the barrel... how else were you planning on mixing all the ingredients? Surely not in the giant cooking pot at Dadaupa Gorge?
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 05.ogg Lisa: After much deliberation, I realized this was a job for the most sociable and savviest member in our ranks, the Cavalry Captain. So I asked him to take a trip to the Dawn Winery, and somehow bring back a wine barrel.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 06.ogg Lisa: Difficult? For you? Don't be silly, negotiating is your biggest strength.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 07.ogg Lisa: Weinlesefest is one of the most important festivals in Mondstadt, and you know how Diluc thinks better than anyone.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 08.ogg Lisa: Just drop a few little hints, like how this is the first festival Mondstadt has had in a long time, we're short on much-needed supplies for a multitude of reasons... Oh, who can help us?
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 09.ogg Lisa: When he hears that, I guarantee you he'll offer to help out with finances and sourcing goods.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 10.ogg Lisa: Dear me, what's gotten you so upset, my little wolf cub? We can't have you being so down in the dumps.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 11.ogg Lisa: Ah, I see.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 12.ogg Lisa: Hmm. Cutie, how about you keep Kaeya company while I stay here and help Razor process his feelings? As his teacher, I owe him some tutelage anyway.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 13.ogg Lisa: Come and collect him in a few days' time. The last ingredient should be ready by then as well.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 14b 1.ogg Lisa: Well, aren't you a sweet one? But this is as much my business as yours. It's my pleasure, really.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 lisa 15.ogg Lisa: Run along now, and don't forget to tell Diluc that the Knights of Favonius send our regards.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh!? But obviously, the knights part is supposed to be "a defender's will." But what kind of ingredient is a barrel?
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 paimon 02a 1.ogg Paimon: Oh... F—Fair enough...
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 paimon 02b 1.ogg Paimon: Is your brain half-asleep or something? It doesn't make any sense at all!
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Lisa's literally trying to extort Master Diluc!
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wow, he didn't take much persuading!
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Ugh, and Paimon was just about to thank Lisa for the things she's been doing for Razor behind the scenes...
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Paimon doesn't even know whose side to be on anymore...
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 razor 01.ogg Razor: ...
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 razor 02.ogg Razor: (Traveler) and teacher, did a lot for me. A lot of work.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 razor 03.ogg Razor: But me... I still can't answer questions. So useless.
Media:vo jnjeq002 5 razor 04.ogg Razor: I don't know what is right, but I trust Teacher. I accept.
Media:vo jnjeq002 6 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Oh, I'm sorry, my mind was elsewhere... What was your question?
Media:vo jnjeq002 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Kaeya, you're fond of a good drink, aren't you? Weinlesefest must be right up your alley.
Media:vo jnjeq002 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh, Kaeya...?
Media:vo jnjeq002 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmph, never mind. Nothing that important.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 adelinde 01.ogg Adelinde: How did you put it? Ah, yes: "Taking a trip home during festival season is a universal custom, common to all the cultures of Teyvat." Now that even Master Diluc has made an offer... Are you quite sure you won't stay for a meal after coming all this way, Master Kaeya?
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 adelinde 02.ogg Adelinde: Oh, don't say that. How often do I get a chance to indulge my dear Master Kaeya, hmm? Tea for the Cavalry Captain when you visit in an official capacity doesn't count. I only get to spoil you if you'll let me cook for you.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 adelinde 03.ogg Adelinde: Take care, Master Kaeya. Have a safe trip back.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Oh? I was just wondering who'd be coming all the way out here during the Weinlesefest. So it's you two.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: ...And you, too.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Please get to the point.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: And the Knights of Favonius's woes have what, exactly, to do with me?
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: ...Hmph.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: Give that silver tongue of yours a rest. You might need it to maintain public order at the festival.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 07.ogg Diluc: Duly noted on the financial issues you raised. I'll have Elzer follow up with Hertha in more detail.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 08.ogg Diluc: And I just so happen to have a batch of wine that I can offer as a token of appreciation to everyone that has been working so hard for the festival.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 09.ogg Diluc: Shall I address it to you personally?
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 10.ogg Diluc: You're better informed than I thought. In that case, I will leave this with Adelinde and keep everything anonymous.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 11.ogg Diluc: Are you two here regarding the Weinlesefest, too?
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 12.ogg Diluc: It's okay. I understand.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 13.ogg Diluc: We have a spare barrel in the winery. It's a little old, but it's been specially treated for durability. You could leave it next to a Flaming Flower all day and there wouldn't be a scratch. I think that one should satisfy your needs.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 14.ogg Diluc: No need. I'll have someone deliver it to the festival market. Just collect it from the Angel's Share stand.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 15.ogg Diluc: You're more than welcome. Helping each other is what friends do.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 16.ogg Diluc: ...It's nearly dinner time. Would you care to stay for a meal?
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 17.ogg Diluc: Hmph.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 18.ogg Diluc: What happened to your swagger? Lost for words?
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 19.ogg Diluc: Surely you wouldn't dream of disappointing Adelinde?
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 20.ogg Diluc: Glad you liked it. You're welcome to join again anytime.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 diluc 21.ogg Diluc: Indeed. Goodbye.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Brrr, so cold. Almost enough to make me feel unwelcome here, Master Diluc.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: Don't forget that this is my home, too. I'm fairly certain that taking a trip home during festival season is a universal custom, common to all the cultures of Teyvat.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: The point is one that you've already raised yourself: the Weinlesefest.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: To celebrate this long-awaited festival, the Acting Grand Master has been coordinating with both the church and the Adventurers' Guild to host a series of events.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Unfortunately, given the financial situation of the Knights of Favonius... Well, I'm sure you can imagine...
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: Hey, no need to be so cruel. Even I'm not going to take that. Everyone's just doing the best they can for Mondstadt.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: Now, I can't remember the last time I tasted Dawn Winery's Weinlesefest special... And I'm sure the Mondstadt populace would echo this sentiment.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: Are you going to deny others the opportunity to drink to their hearts' content just because you don't like to drink yourself?
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Anyway, speaking of the knights, everyone dearly hopes that you'll rejoin our ranks again one day. Then we'll be one big, happy family again.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: If we were able to enjoy the sterling reputation of Master Diluc, my... I'm sure people would be queuing for our charity booth all the way to Falcon Coast...
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: That would be an absurd request, even for me. The words "with compliments from the Dawn Winery" ought never be preceded by "To the Cavalry Captain." Is that not the unwritten rule?
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: I really can't thank you enough.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: Poor Razor. He grew up so fast, and he's still looking for his father. Master Diluc, we really ought to lend him a hand.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: Wonderful. Always eager to help, and never forgets to return a favor. That's the Master Diluc I know.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: How time flies... I'll be on my way, then...
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: I couldn't possibly, Adelinde. I wouldn't want to trouble you.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 17.ogg Kaeya: Oh, uh...
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 18.ogg Kaeya: ...Ahaha... Diluc, you—
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 19.ogg Kaeya: ...Alright then. I'll take you up on the offer. Adelinde, one more set of cutlery, please, if you'd be so kind.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 20.ogg Kaeya: Oh? Then I may have to tag along on (Traveler)'s adventures more often in the future.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 kaeya 21.ogg Kaeya: Alright, now that our task is complete and our bellies are full, it's time for me to get back to work.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hi there, Master Diluc!
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Check it out, Kaeya's not-so-subtly asking for freebies... He's actually doing it...
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Master Diluc is so generous! That's all Paimon needs to get that warm, fuzzy feeling... which is just as well, since she won't be allowed to drink a drop.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: How come Klee said he's looking for his mom, but Kaeya says he's looking for his dad...? It might make more sense to them, but it's gonna get confusing for everyone else!
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Sounds great, we'll take it! When can we come fetch it?
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Ah, you always make things so nice and easy for us, Master Diluc! Hehe, thanks a lot. Razor will really appreciate it.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Oof, Paimon's so full... Adelinde's cooking is amazing. Everything looked and tasted so beautiful.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Ugh, Kaeya's back to his usual ways.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: We should get going as well. Lisa's taking care of Razor, but the Weinlesefest can't do without us.
Media:vo jnjeq002 7 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: See you next time, Master Diluc!
Now, take a guess: is Klee currently planning to go out for an adventure, or is she going to Starfell Lake for some fish blasting?
Rosaria - Thorny Benevolence
Rosaria is a sister of the Church of Favonius, but you wouldn't know it except for her attire.
So infamous is his bad luck that other adventurers are rarely willing to team up with him. Yet Bennett has grown used to being alone and doesn't let it discourage him. No matter how many injuries he may suffer, his fiery passion for adventure burns on.
Spark Knight Klee of the Knights of Favonius, reporting for duty!
The group dines to the sound of Kaeya's jesting and Diluc's disapproving grunts...
Though she does often get herself into some trouble, but is playfulness not the purview of young children?
Whichever the case, she'd best be careful, or the monster of the confinement room is going to catch her!
You certainly won't find her saying prayers or attending Church gatherings. If you need to find this elusive sister for any reason, then you might be looking for quite a while.
You tell Diluc that you're helping Razor to make Thousand-Wind Wine...
Young Bennett is one of the most passionate adventurers in Mondstadt. He is also by far the least fortunate...
