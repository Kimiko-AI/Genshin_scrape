 How about something sweet instead?
 It's kind of like snow on the mountains...
 Like a sprout pushing through the ice to give you a kiss...
 Quest Description"Is the white-haired lady passing by an adeptus from Liyue?""I can't tell. Can you?" "Me, neither..."
 The milky foam doesn't have much taste to it...
 The moment you taste the sweetness of the juice...
 What would you like?
(Traveler): (Alright, this drink is looking good.)
(Traveler): (We should just make a Snow-Covered Kiss...)
Another familiar face has arrived at the tavern.
Media:vo eqtj008 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hi there! Paimon would be more surprised to see you if we hadn't already seen a bunch of our friends...
Media:vo eqtj008 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh!? Wait, you're Shenhe! This is a surprise!
Media:vo eqtj008 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You needed help with directions?... Wait, you came all this way just for a drink?
Media:vo eqtj008 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Here's the menu!
Media:vo eqtj008 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Well, Boreal Watch here probably is referring to the Wolf of the North. So yeah, you could say it's cold.
Media:vo eqtj008 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon's tried that one. It's actually caramel flavored coffee. "Pinecone" just refers to the color!
Media:vo eqtj008 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Those medicinal herbs don't grow around here. If you want something bitter, then it'd have to be coffee...
Media:vo eqtj008 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: That's a good idea. You've practiced the adepti arts long enough. It's time for something new!
Media:vo eqtj008 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Let's make Shenhe a Snow-Covered Kiss! It sounds like a perfect fit for her.
Media:vo eqtj008 1 shenhe 01.ogg Shenhe: Hello, (Traveler).
Media:vo eqtj008 1 shenhe 02.ogg Shenhe: This place isn't easy to find. Angel's Share... The name doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.
Media:vo eqtj008 1 shenhe 03.ogg Shenhe: Mr. Zhongli was kind enough to help me with directions. I'm thankful.
Media:vo eqtj008 1 shenhe 04.ogg Shenhe: That's right.
Media:vo eqtj008 1 shenhe 05.ogg Shenhe: Because... we're friends.
Media:vo eqtj008 1 shenhe 06.ogg Shenhe: Boreal Watch... Hmm, Boreal? As in a cold climate?
Media:vo eqtj008 1 shenhe 07.ogg Shenhe: Caramel Pinecone... How could that be a drink?
Media:vo eqtj008 1 shenhe 08.ogg Shenhe: Huh...
Media:vo eqtj008 1 shenhe 09.ogg Shenhe: These names are confusing. I can't make sense of any of these.
Media:vo eqtj008 1 shenhe 10.ogg Shenhe: I'll leave it up to you. As long as it's something that tastes like Qingxin or Violetgrass.
Media:vo eqtj008 1 shenhe 11.ogg Shenhe: Fine.
Media:vo eqtj008 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's called a Snow-Covered Kiss! Whisk milk until it froths, and then gently pour it over some juice. It looks like it's covered by a layer of snow.
Media:vo eqtj008 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Don't ask why it's called a kiss, though... Paimon doesn't get it either. It's probably just a gimmick to get it to sell better!
Media:vo eqtj008 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Uh, Paimon's just guessing... Maybe it's more of a romantic description!
Media:vo eqtj008 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Uhh... It's hard to explain! Stop making Paimon come up with things.
Media:vo eqtj008 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Mm-hmm, that's right.
Media:vo eqtj008 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Oh? Really?
Media:vo eqtj008 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: But wait, why is Paimon the one who's confused now!?
Media:vo eqtj008 2 shenhe 01.ogg Shenhe: Hmm, it's sweet and smooth. Not bitter at all. What is it?
Media:vo eqtj008 2 shenhe 02.ogg Shenhe: A gimmick?
Media:vo eqtj008 2 shenhe 03.ogg Shenhe: Romantic?
Media:vo eqtj008 2 shenhe 04.ogg Shenhe: ...Oh.
Media:vo eqtj008 2 shenhe 05.ogg Shenhe: I see. I seem to understand now.
Media:vo eqtj008 2 shenhe 06.ogg Shenhe: Occasionally, I chew on divine herbs as I wander about in the mountains. I have witnessed the moment a new sprout breaks through the soil.
Media:vo eqtj008 2 shenhe 07.ogg Shenhe: The elation in my heart then does bear a resemblance to what I'm experiencing now.
Media:vo eqtj008 2 shenhe 08.ogg Shenhe: Thank you for helping me understand these obscure names, (Traveler).
Media:vo eqtj008 2 shenhe 09.ogg Shenhe: I might need your help again sometime in the future.
