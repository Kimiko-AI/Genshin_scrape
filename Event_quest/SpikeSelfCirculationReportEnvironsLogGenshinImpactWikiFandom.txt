 Quest DescriptionWhile you attempted to move the Pursina's Spike into the frontline mines, you face a significant number of obstacles...
 Well, I am pretty good at what I do.
Hao: I just hope there won't be any long-lasting side effects...
Hao: What on earth was that dark mud. I just touched it once by mistake, and it felt like my entire side went cold... *cough*
Hosseini: ...Looks like we need another solution.
Hosseini: But clearing the mud out as we go isn't a good idea either. The closer we get to the area venting the mud, the more intense the rate at which it will just keep flowing out. We have to stop this problem directly at its source.
Hosseini: I am most glad that you were the one Khedive got to help us out. If it were anyone else, I doubt they could have solved this issue quite so handily.
Hosseini: Indeed, that is plain to see.
Hosseini: Is there some way we can transport the Pursina's Spike without touching the ground?
Hosseini: My, as I should have expected of you, I suppose. Now the dark mud and monsters are gone, with minimal damage to the Pursina's Spike.
Hosseini: The dark mud keeps spreading gradually. This state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist...
Hosseini: The two miners, Tu and Hao, have headed back to rest. Looks like it'll be difficult to move the Spike back right away...
Tu: *cough* I'm a little unwell, but I'm feeling much better now than I did down there in the mining complex.
