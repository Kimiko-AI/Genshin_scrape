 Hello?
 I would have preferred to handle this my way.
 It was nothing.
 Quest DescriptionThe unusual fellow may have gotten away in the end, but at least the merchant route is safe again.
Ella Musk:  Well! Either way, my dictionary has been further refined, and we've obtained more evidence to support my thesis that harmonious coexistence between human and hilichurl kind is viable.
Ella Musk: Ah, I almost forgot — this is for you, as thanks for your help.
Ella Musk: But from the linguistic corpus I have managed to assemble thus far, it seems likely that it was simply looking to make some friends in an unfamiliar land.
Ella Musk: Hmm...? Oh, it's you! Thanks for your help.
Ella Musk: Homu... mimi tomo... Hmm...
Ella Musk: It is a real pity that you didn't get to converse with it...
Ella Musk: Still, it is a pity that we didn't get the opportunity to converse with the Unusual Hilichurl...
Ella Musk: Ya ika!!! ...O—Oh, it's just you, phew... Goodness, you gave me the fright of my life. Please, I'd appreciate it if you didn't interrupt me like that.
Ella Musk: You helped me a lot here, and I do apologize for having put you through so much trouble... But I do hope I will have the pleasure of working with you again in the future.
Katheryne: Although you were unable to capture the Unusual Hilichurl and we still cannot ascertain the reason for the recent spate of disturbances... the wilderness is much safer now, so thank you.
Katheryne: Greetings, Adventurer! I have already been informed about your completion of the mission. The Guild is grateful for your ongoing support! Here is your compensation.
Katheryne: On a related note, Ella Musk is waiting for you in the library.
Paimon: How are we interrupting when you called us here in the first place!?
Paimon: Well now, isn't that very polite of you all of a sudden...
