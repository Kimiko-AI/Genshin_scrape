Media:vo clwq002 3 bigmeatmaru 01a 2.ogg Miitoboru: He would harpoon fish with his barbed spear. I never saw him miss once. You have "the Catch" with you, don't you? I've sensed it for some time now... Ah, those were good times.
Media:vo clwq002 3 bigmeatmaru 01a 3.ogg Miitoboru: I'm sure he's still sailing across the sea, charting a course towards his dreams.

Media:vo clwq002 3 bigmeatmaru 01b 2.ogg Miitoboru: He would harpoon fish with his barbed spear. I never saw him miss once. I do wonder where he is now...
Media:vo clwq002 3 bigmeatmaru 01b 3.ogg Miitoboru: But knowing him, I'm sure he would do everything he could to return to Seirai...
 Do you wanna go again?
Media:vo clwq002 6 kosekimaru 02a.ogg Kosekimaru: Haha, I'd rather not.
 Is Miitoboru also affected by the machine...
 Is it because the machine was turned off...
 Kosekimaru can't speak anymore...
 Oh, go on then...
 Paimon, you never change.
 Paimon...
 Quest DescriptionMiitoboru seems to have some request or another. Talk to him and learn the details...
 Step DescriptionCollect the treasure that Miitoboru mentioned with him
 Tell us.
 You're too kind.
As you speak, the area around you becomes shrouded in fog...
Having left the guiding light, you lose your way amidst the fog.
In but a few breaths, thunder and lightning begin raging across the skies..
Kosekimaru: (The ship named Kosekimaru does not respond...)
Kosekimaru: ...
Media:vo clwq002 1 bigmeatmaru 01.ogg Miitoboru: Ahoy, here you are. I thought you'd be too busy flying around the islands with those wings o' yours.
Media:vo clwq002 1 bigmeatmaru 02.ogg Miitoboru: Bet you've long forgotten your old mate Miitoboru, sitting there slowly soaking away in the ocean.
Media:vo clwq002 1 bigmeatmaru 03.ogg Miitoboru: It's not that important... Remember when you helped me find the missing pieces of my body?
Media:vo clwq002 1 bigmeatmaru 04.ogg Miitoboru: How can I put it... I'm not sure if it's because I've fulfilled my wishes, or if these waters are slowly diminishing my ability to talk...
Media:vo clwq002 1 bigmeatmaru 05.ogg Miitoboru: Recently, I find myself sleeping most of the time rather than staying conscious...
Media:vo clwq002 1 bigmeatmaru 06.ogg Miitoboru: I see... So it's because of some contraption that I became your Waverider and could communicate with you, (Traveler)...
Media:vo clwq002 1 bigmeatmaru 07.ogg Miitoboru: Haha, there'll be no need for that, Paimon... I am quite content that I had the chance to talk to you at all.
Media:vo clwq002 1 bigmeatmaru 08.ogg Miitoboru: Argh... The more I think about it, for me, as a ship, to have gotten to talk to you in the past few days... It really is a wondrous thing, the stuff dreams are made of...
Media:vo clwq002 1 bigmeatmaru 09.ogg Miitoboru: But now, I need to ask you for one more favor...
Media:vo clwq002 1 bigmeatmaru 10.ogg Miitoboru: Remember when I told you that once we found my body, I'd take you for a cruise? Well, it seems my body was reduced to a slew of sorry shipwrecks...
Media:vo clwq002 1 bigmeatmaru 11.ogg Miitoboru: And most of the treasure was taken away, leaving nothing good for you...
Media:vo clwq002 1 bigmeatmaru 12.ogg Miitoboru: But this time, I swear as a mighty pirate ship, there be treasure ahoy, and a fine treasure at that! Or else may I be strangled by seagrass and fed to the fish! Just trust me one last time!
Media:vo clwq002 1 bigmeatmaru 13.ogg Miitoboru: Argh! Come on then, me hearties! Time to come aboard!
Media:vo clwq002 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Didn't Miitoboru say he wanted to meet us, (Traveler)?
Media:vo clwq002 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's go find him and see what it's about!
Media:vo clwq002 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We're here now, aren't we!
Media:vo clwq002 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: So, you said you needed our help. What's up?
Media:vo clwq002 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh... Does that mean that once the effects of the machine wear off, Miitoboru won't be able to talk anymore?
Media:vo clwq002 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: We gotta do something before it's too late, (Traveler)...
Media:vo clwq002 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Well, (Traveler), since Miitoboru probably won't be able to speak soon...
Media:vo clwq002 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: And... Since there really is treasure this time... Let's go, (Traveler)!
Media:vo clwq002 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Time to set sail!
Media:vo clwq002 2 bigmeatmaru 01.ogg Miitoboru: Those lights are from Inazuma. I haven't seen them for many a year... Follow them...
Media:vo clwq002 2 bigmeatmaru 02.ogg Miitoboru: They look just like fishing lanterns. I feel like I'm back in the port at Seirai, with the fishing boats lining the harbor at night...
Media:vo clwq002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uhh, why did it get so foggy all of a sudden... Wow, (Traveler), look! There's a lot more lights on the sea!
Media:vo clwq002 3 bigmeatmaru 01a 1.ogg Miitoboru: Even pirates don't get to go on adventures every day. When he had free time, Zaemon would take us out fishing.
Media:vo clwq002 3 bigmeatmaru 01a 2.ogg Miitoboru: He would harpoon fish with his barbed spear. I never saw him miss once. You have "the Catch" with you, don't you? I've sensed it for some time now... Ah, those were good times.
Media:vo clwq002 3 bigmeatmaru 01a 3.ogg Miitoboru: I'm sure he's still sailing across the sea, charting a course towards his dreams.
Media:vo clwq002 3 bigmeatmaru 01b 2.ogg Miitoboru: He would harpoon fish with his barbed spear. I never saw him miss once. I do wonder where he is now...
Media:vo clwq002 3 bigmeatmaru 01b 3.ogg Miitoboru: But knowing him, I'm sure he would do everything he could to return to Seirai...
Media:vo clwq002 4 bigmeatmaru 01.ogg Miitoboru: Oh, oh! I just remembered, I've got two things to tell you. First of all, I've remembered my name...
Media:vo clwq002 4 bigmeatmaru 02.ogg Miitoboru: The Maiden of Asase Shrine named me "Kosekimaru." Most of my mates were from Koseki Village, and she hoped I could take them back to their hometown...
Media:vo clwq002 4 bigmeatmaru 03.ogg Miitoboru: But I... I failed them. If only I could have been stronger, I might've been able to survive the thunderstorm and make it back to Koseki Village with my friends safe and sound...
Media:vo clwq002 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow! So, Miitoboru... no wait. So, Mr. Ship, what's your real name?
Media:vo clwq002 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Kosekimaru... Hmm, Paimon still prefers Miitoboru, but Kosekimaru's a nice name too.
Media:vo clwq002 5 bigmeatmaru 01.ogg Miitoboru: This thunderstorm is just like the one on that day... And so were the Inazuman lights we saw, too. Is this all happening because of me? Festering fishbait... I'm going to drag everyone down with me...
Media:vo clwq002 5 kosekimaru 01.ogg Kosekimaru: Aye, you're right, I am the proud Kosekimaru, pirate ship under the command of the mighty pirate, Ako Domeki!
Media:vo clwq002 5 kosekimaru 02.ogg Kosekimaru: The wood of Seirai made my flesh and bones, and the Shrine Maiden of Asase gave me my name. I have sailed the seas for decades, never once leaving my friends behind! Even when fighting the strongest foes, I never feared, nor faltered!
Media:vo clwq002 5 kosekimaru 03.ogg Kosekimaru: A little thunder and lightning can't stop me! Ha! Watch me breeze through it!
Media:vo clwq002 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa, where'd that thunder come from... Be careful!
Media:vo clwq002 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Come on, Miito... Kosekimaru! You can do it!
Media:vo clwq002 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Sail through the thunderstorm, Kosekimaru!
Media:vo clwq002 6 kosekimaru 01.ogg Kosekimaru: Haha, a talking ship is still just a ship. (Traveler)'s superb sailing skill was what saw us safely through the storm.
Media:vo clwq002 6 kosekimaru 02a.ogg Kosekimaru: Haha, I'd rather not.
Media:vo clwq002 6 kosekimaru 03.ogg Kosekimaru: *sigh* I'm afraid I may have triggered the thunderstorm. These waters are less stable than they once were...
Media:vo clwq002 6 kosekimaru 04.ogg Kosekimaru: But... we've arrived! (Traveler), Paimon, the treasure is right up there!
Media:vo clwq002 6 kosekimaru 05.ogg Kosekimaru: I am certain that there's treasure up there this time. It's... What did I call it again? It's the intuition of a mighty pirate ship!
Media:vo clwq002 6 kosekimaru 06.ogg Kosekimaru: Hahaha, I thought you'd already forgotten. I'll tell you when you come back!
Media:vo clwq002 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whew, that was close. Paimon was sure we were gonna sink!
Media:vo clwq002 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Kosekimaru, you're amazing!
Media:vo clwq002 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Isn't this the place we first visited when we were looking for treasure? There was nothing here but half of Kosekimaru's hull!
Media:vo clwq002 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wait a minute... You said you had two things to tell us, right? And the first one was that you'd remembered your name. What was the other one?
Media:vo clwq002 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Surely the treasure should be near Kosekimaru's shipwreck...
Media:vo clwq002 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's go and check it out, (Traveler)!
Media:vo clwq002 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wow, there really is treasure here this time! That's so strange, how did we miss it last time?
Media:vo clwq002 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Come on! Let's go find Kosekimaru and show him what we've found!
Media:vo clwq002 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Kosekimaru, Kosekimaru!
Media:vo clwq002 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We found the treasure. Look, it's a model pirate ship! Your intuition finally worked this time!
Media:vo clwq002 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So, what's the other thing you wanted to tell us?
Media:vo clwq002 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Kosekimaru?
Media:vo clwq002 8 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: ...Hmph, but he said he'd tell us when we returned.
Media:vo clwq002 8 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Kosekimaru... you're a big fat liar!
