 It must be pretty expensive...
 Looks pretty complicated...
 Quest DescriptionRuijin from Liyue Harbor is promoting a new "game"...
 Theater Mechanicus? What's that?
 Uh, well how much does it cost to play?
Ruijin:  C'mon, give it a try! I'll even let you play the first round for free and you can keep your Xiao Lantern.

(Theater Mechanicus Gameplay Tutorial)
Ruijin: Do you see these things laid out on the table here? These are all important items used in Theater Mechanicus.
Ruijin: Hello! Would you like to play a round of Theater Mechanicus?
Ruijin: If you'd like to try, just bring me a Xiao Lantern and you'll be good to go!
Ruijin: It may seem complicated, but you'll get the hang of it after you play a couple of times.
Ruijin: No, not at all. It is the Lantern Rite, after all. Besides, I was hoping to collect everyone's initial impressions of the game.
Ruijin: Oh, never heard of it? Allow me to introduce it to you then. Theater Mechanicus is a kind of tabletop game invented by yours truly.
Ruijin: So all it'll cost you to play is a single Xiao Lantern.
Ruijin: So, how about it? Would you like to give it a try?
