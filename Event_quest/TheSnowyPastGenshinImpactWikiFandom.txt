Bennett - Trial by Fire
Young Bennett is one of the most passionate adventurers in Mondstadt. He is also by far the least fortunate...
So infamous is his bad luck that other adventurers are rarely willing to team up with him. Yet Bennett has grown used to being alone and doesn't let it discourage him. No matter how many injuries he may suffer, his fiery passion for adventure burns on.
Come on, there's treasure waiting up ahead in the unknown! Benny's Adventure Team, assemble!

Eula - Dance of the Shimmering Wave
Eula is a member of the Lawrence Clan by birth.
The Lawrence Clan's oppressive rule plunged Mondstadt into one of the darkest periods of its history. Today, they have long since fallen from grace, but their present-day descendants still find themselves held in contempt for the transgressions of their forefathers.
Not content to accept her fate, Eula has chosen to face the hostility of others head-on, and to prove with her blade that the noble spirit forsaken by her predecessors is alive and well in her.
Should you meet this bold knight, be sure to cast aside your reservations and greet her courteously. She, in turn, will be sure to extend the utmost courtesy to you.
 (And why does he look so serious?)
 (But... there's something about Albedo today...)
 (Something seems different. What could it be?)
 (Did something happen?)
 (Something seems different. What could it be?)
 (That voice sounded very familiar!)
 ...
 A strange and tenacious life force.
 About that. There's something else I couldn't say earlier.
 Actually... it's nothing serious...
 Alright, fine...
 Bennett, are you hurt?
Media:vo dialog eqxs102 bennett 02a.ogg Bennett: No, I'm fine. Thank you for asking! Right now I just need to get outta here... Brrrr, I'm so cold... Achoo!
 But... Joel's father...
 Careful, Paimon.
 Did you hear that...
 Didn't he come with us?
 Do you realize how absurd you sound right now?
 Don't be like that. You're great too.
 Don't blame yourself for Paimon's outlandishness.
 Don't worry about it. The Honorary Knight will help you.
 Eula can help.
 Eula desperately needs this kind of opportunity.
 Eula?
 Got it.
 He's not been that long.
 Hi all. Long time no see.
 Hi, Joel!
 I approve.
 I can help tidy up.
 I don't think it's that simple.
 I just heard a strange noise coming from up the mountain...
 I remember that kid...
 I want people to know all the good qualities she has.
 I will make sure to keep Paimon in check in the future.
 I'm not going anywhere.
 Paimon and I will help with the investigation.
 I'm trying to figure out what you're thinking...
 It looks like we lost it.
 It sounds like...
 It's a long story...
 It's been a long time, Joel.
 Let's go check it out!
 No problem.
 Okay.
 Paimon and I will help with the investigation.
 Quest DescriptionPaimon has an odd thought and drags you off to the Mondstadt alchemy shop...Paimon, struck by a bout of imagination, drags you off to the alchemy store in Mondstadt to expound her bold hypothesis to Sucrose and Timaeus, but is told that the best person to answer such questions is, in fact, the scholarly Albedo. However, the person waiting for you there is...
 Right.
 Since it's for Joel, count me in.
 Since it's you, Amber, count me in.
 So it was just you.
 So there's something else bothering you?
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 14b 1.ogg Eula: Hm. How very perceptive of you.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 14b 2.ogg Eula: Were you staring at me the whole time when everyone was talking? You shan't be getting off lightly for that.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 14b 3.ogg Eula: The truth is, I'm a little concerned that I might be quite inept at building snowmen.
 So you're leading rookies, too...
 So... you want me to learn to paint now?
 Sorry, I just don't know what has gotten into Paimon today.
 Sorry, what have I walked into here?
 Sure.
 Take it easy. It's just for fun.
 That's just how Eula talks...
 Then it's time to get building a snowman!
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 14a 1.ogg Eula: Indeed. It's just...
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 14a 2.ogg Eula: *sigh* That's the thing. I'm a little worried that I won't be up to the challenge.
 Then why is the thief not with you?
 There's no one else around. You can say.
 Uh... Amber, what are you doing here?
 We are alone here. Just tell me.
 We drove off the Fatui.
 We got revenge for you.
 We got revenge for you.
 We were probably overthinking it.
 We will find the key.
Media:vo dialog eqxs102 bennett 02b.ogg Bennett: Thanks! I'll be, uh, waiting right here!
 We're the only ones who can help.
 What about Amber...?
 What's going on...?
 What's the occasion?
 You can't directly compare knights and adventurers.
 You take care, too!
 You're acting a little out of character...
 You're in safe hands with Eula...
A strange rustling surrounds you...
After Albedo leaves, you and Paimon wait outside the cavern for a while...
Albedo recounts meeting you, discovering the theft at the camp, and the pursuit of the culprit to everyone...

Media:vo dialog eqxs101 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: It feels like every time I try to drum up some enthusiasm for my idea, nobody wants to know. But whenever the young lass starts talking, everyone rallies behind her! ...What am I doing wrong?
Media:vo dialog eqxs101 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: ...
Media:vo dialog eqxs101 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Have you done anything apart from resting all day? Come on, are your supplies ready? Have you done your warm-up exercises? If not, then get to it, lad!
Media:vo dialog eqxs101 recklesspallad 01.ogg Reckless Pallad: Hey, don't talk that way, Cyrus! You're the branch master! You're awesome!
Media:vo dialog eqxs101 recklesspallad 02.ogg Reckless Pallad: Oh, uh, yeah! Sure!
Media:vo dialog eqxs101 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Timaeus... it's not completely useless, but... perhaps it needs to be a little more original...
Media:vo dialog eqxs101 timaeus 01.ogg Timaeus: Seriously!? Albedo doesn't like my alchemy device? It can create tiny ice crystals! I thought I had a good design here — I was planning to take it further...
Media:vo dialog eqxs101 timaeus 02.ogg Timaeus: O—Okay... I see. I'll give it some more thought... Hmm, then again, what IS the use of this thing? I'm the one who came up with it, and even I can't think of a potential application...
Media:vo dialog eqxs102 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: I'm sorry to trouble you. This was all my fault...
Media:vo dialog eqxs102 bennett 02a.ogg Bennett: No, I'm fine. Thank you for asking! Right now I just need to get outta here... Brrrr, I'm so cold... Achoo!
Media:vo dialog eqxs102 bennett 02b.ogg Bennett: Thanks! I'll be, uh, waiting right here!
Media:vo eqxs101 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, let's go see Timaeus. Paimon has a favor to ask him!
Media:vo eqxs101 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It'd be great if we could catch Sucrose and Albedo, too... but they seem really busy lately, so let's not get our hopes up.
Media:vo eqxs101 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Anyway, let's go see!
Media:vo eqxs101 10 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: ...
Media:vo eqxs101 10 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Some things are missing.
Media:vo eqxs101 10 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: It's hard to say their value, but...
Media:vo eqxs101 10 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: Some of my alchemy notes are missing.
Media:vo eqxs101 10 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: To the uninitiated, they are merely scraps of paper. But for someone who knows what they're doing... the knowledge contained in those notes is more valuable than any treasure.
Media:vo eqxs101 10 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: I feel the same way. However, hilichurl break-ins and other such incidents are not unheard-of on Dragonspine. It's difficult to draw a conclusion based solely on the evidence at hand.
Media:vo eqxs101 10 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: ...
Media:vo eqxs101 10 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: Hmm? These appear to be...
Media:vo eqxs101 10 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: Fresh ones. Meaning, our thief can't have made it far.
Media:vo eqxs101 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Aaaah!
Media:vo eqxs101 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Thieves! It's gotta be!
Media:vo eqxs101 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Nothing valuable, hopefully? Wait, where's Paimon's Mora?
Media:vo eqxs101 10 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Alchemy notes? Would they fetch a high price?
Media:vo eqxs101 10 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: So you're saying only someone who knows alchemy would've stolen them? But the only people who come to Dragonspine are adventurers, thieves, and monsters... What use would any of them have with your notes?
Media:vo eqxs101 10 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Footprints?
Media:vo eqxs101 10 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Let's chase them down. We can't let 'em get away!
Media:vo eqxs101 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, Timae— Huh, is that Albedo? Why is he leaving?
Media:vo eqxs101 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Were you having a really serious discussion right now, or something?
Media:vo eqxs101 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ugh, so we just missed him. Maybe we should have hollered to him...
Media:vo eqxs101 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: He didn't look in the best of moods just now, though. Was he upset about something? If so, he probably wouldn't have been in the mood to help out, anyway.
Media:vo eqxs101 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Yeah! He wasn't looking his usual self.
Media:vo eqxs101 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hehe, nah! Anyway, Paimon wanted to ask you for a favor, Timaeus!
Media:vo eqxs101 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Well, Paimon found a bunch of super-duper sweet Sunsettias in the mountains the other day. But if Paimon eats them all, then they'll be gone, so Paimon isn't ready to finish them all yet...
Media:vo eqxs101 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Paimon was thinking maybe you could make a device that you put fruits in, and it turns them into juice! That way, they'll be preserved for as long as Paimon needs!
Media:vo eqxs101 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Huh? Seems pretty straightforward to Paimon... can't you do it?
Media:vo eqxs101 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Okay, so how about you, Sucrose? Any idea?
Media:vo eqxs101 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Huh... Well, excuse Paimon for overestimating the power of alchemy...
Media:vo eqxs101 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: P—Paimon just wanted some fruit juice... What's wrong with that!?
Media:vo eqxs101 2 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Hmm, he doesn't seem to be in a good mood today, though. What if he ignores us?
Media:vo eqxs101 2 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Hey, so, where is Albedo heading to, anyway? Dragonspine?
Media:vo eqxs101 2 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Then let's go to Dragonspine to find him. C'mon, there's no time to lose!
Media:vo eqxs101 2 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Hello, you two! It's been a long time!
Media:vo eqxs101 2 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Huh... upset? You mean, Albedo?
Media:vo eqxs101 2 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Upset... uh-oh, I wonder if...
Media:vo eqxs101 2 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: I wonder if Timaeus's research topic is... so boring this time that Albedo finally snapped?
Media:vo eqxs101 2 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: I'm sorry... it doesn't sound like it falls within my area of expertise. I could give it a try if you really want, but... I'd probably just end up giving all your precious fruits arms and legs.
Media:vo eqxs101 2 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: Well, as you know, my focus is on Bio-Alchemy... Besides, keeping things fresh forever is just not possible. If you just wanted to modify certain properties of the fruit or their seeds, on the other hand, I'd easily be able to help with that.
Media:vo eqxs101 2 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: Alchemists usually focus in on their own research areas. Take us for example — Timaeus, Albedo, and I all have very different research foci.
Media:vo eqxs101 2 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: Paimon, your idea is very imaginative... but it's beyond Timaeus's and my ability.
Media:vo eqxs101 2 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: I don't think even Albedo could make such an incredible device... After all, alchemy is not mechanics. There is a big difference between the two.
Media:vo eqxs101 2 sucrose 10.ogg Sucrose: In fact, before Albedo showed up, everyone in Mondstadt thought alchemy was useless.
Media:vo eqxs101 2 sucrose 11.ogg Sucrose: Of course, we know better now. But even then, I have to admit that alchemy is only one of the many wondrous arts in the world. It's certainly not some kind of all-powerful magic that can simply take a substance and preserve it indefinitely... Ahem! Uh, sorry, that wasn't meant as a criticism against you personally...
Media:vo eqxs101 2 sucrose 12.ogg Sucrose: Oh, of course, these are just Timaeus's and my subjective opinions on the matter. If you're really intent on pursuing this wondrous device... you can try your luck asking Albedo.
Media:vo eqxs101 2 sucrose 13.ogg Sucrose: But I wouldn't get your hopes up. If he has no idea how to make one either, you'll have to give up on the idea.
Media:vo eqxs101 2 sucrose 14.ogg Sucrose: Unless he specifically says otherwise, Dragonspine is where he usually goes. He seems particularly fond of that place. And somehow, the cold doesn't seem to bother him at all.
Media:vo eqxs101 2 timaeus 01.ogg Timaeus: Hey, it's the Traveler and Paimon!
Media:vo eqxs101 2 timaeus 02.ogg Timaeus: Just a regular catch-up. We meet here once in a while to go through any recent developments in our research projects.
Media:vo eqxs101 2 timaeus 03.ogg Timaeus: Wh—What are you looking at me for?
Media:vo eqxs101 2 timaeus 04.ogg Timaeus: S—Surely not... It's not that boring! ...Is it?
Media:vo eqxs101 2 timaeus 05.ogg Timaeus: A favor? Haha, well sure! How can I help?
Media:vo eqxs101 2 timaeus 06.ogg Timaeus: I'm afraid that sort of thing... is a little, uh...
Media:vo eqxs101 2 timaeus 07.ogg Timaeus: Hahaha. Paimon, I'm afraid you've entered into the realm of the weird and wonderful with this one...
Media:vo eqxs101 2 timaeus 08.ogg Timaeus: Whoa... Your tone is so calm but your words are so terrifying. You'd think I'd be used to this by now...
Media:vo eqxs101 2 timaeus 09.ogg Timaeus: He won't. Albedo is not that kind of person.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Hey, Traveler and Paimon! Fancy meeting you all the way out here.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 ambor 02.ogg Amber: Well, that's part of it, actually...
Media:vo eqxs101 4 ambor 03.ogg Amber: The other reason is, when I was patrolling the perimeter of Dragonspine, I found a lost kid named Joel.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 ambor 04.ogg Amber: I heard he lives here on the camp, so I escorted him back.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 ambor 05.ogg Amber: I know. Joel's father went missing.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 ambor 06.ogg Amber: I totally sympathize with how much Joel misses his family. Dragonspine is so bleak and deserted, it must have been so lonely for him here.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 ambor 07.ogg Amber: Anyway, I wanted to do something to cheer Joel up, so I said I'd build a snowman with him. It's something he enjoys doing.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 ambor 08.ogg Amber: It also gives me a chance to stay here for a while and help Cyrus out.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 ambor 09.ogg Amber: Aw, really? Thank you!
Media:vo eqxs101 4 ambor 10.ogg Amber: Let's go meet up with Joel, then. Oh, I invited another friend of mine to join, too. She should be here any second. She'll be perfect for this kind of thing.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 ambor 11.ogg Amber: Hey, Cyrus, we've gotta take off. Is that okay?
Media:vo eqxs101 4 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Oh? The Traveler is joining us too. Great, fantastic, wonderful! Hahahaha, the more the merrier.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: Hahaha... allow me to explain.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: The Adventurers' Guild is holding winter training on Dragonspine.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: As you know, our members have varying levels of adventure experience. Dragonspine is an excellent place for budding adventurers to challenge themselves and improve... but it's dangerous to go alone.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: So, we made a plan for senior members to pair up with junior members. This way, everyone can experience training on Dragonspine together under safe and controlled circumstances.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: Now, every adventurer can progress together. I have been working on this grand plan for half a year now, and it's finally coming together! Hahaha, it's a great plan, isn't it!?
Media:vo eqxs101 4 cyrus 07.ogg Cyrus: Hey, (Traveler), you are an outstanding adventurer. Surely you must be willing to join us and help out?
Media:vo eqxs101 4 cyrus 08.ogg Cyrus: No problem. Go ahead. I still have some final checks to make, so I will call you before we depart.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hmm? This looks lively, what's the occasion? Let's go and have a look!
Media:vo eqxs101 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Amber, Cyrus, Pallad... What's everyone doing at Dragonspine? Don't you mind the cold?
Media:vo eqxs101 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, right! Paimon remembers most of these people are from the Adventurers' Guild... Then again, it seems a certain Outrider has joined too.
Media:vo eqxs101 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Is the Adventurers' Guild short on experienced members?
Media:vo eqxs101 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Aw, Amber...
Media:vo eqxs101 4 recklesspallad 01.ogg Reckless Pallad: I agree. I feel much better with the Traveler joining us. Definitely the kind of person you want to have around in a tight spot.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Hey, Joel, we're here.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 ambor 02.ogg Amber: Oh, sorry. I forgot to do the introductions.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 ambor 03.ogg Amber: This is Eula, the Spindrift Knight and Captain of the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Company...
Media:vo eqxs101 6 ambor 04.ogg Amber: Yeah, that's something else. But look, Joel's at that age where he should be having fun, and there's nothing to play with on Dragonspine.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 ambor 05.ogg Amber: He used to build snowmen with his dad, and since his dad's not around, we're keeping him company instead.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 ambor 06.ogg Amber: Besides, Eula, it's gotta be more fun than taking an ice bath all by yourself.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 ambor 07.ogg Amber: Let's combine our forces and build ourselves a huge snowman! It'll be a ton of fun.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 ambor 08.ogg Amber: Then let's get started! First, we need to split up into teams to gather some supplies!
Media:vo eqxs101 6 ambor 09.ogg Amber: Joel and I will be on one team. (Traveler), you and Eula can be on the other team.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 ambor 10.ogg Amber: Hey Joel, see that huge tree over there? Wanna race me there?
Media:vo eqxs101 6 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Greetings. We have a slight problem here. We've done a headcount and it turns out that we have an odd number of participants. In other words, we still have one instructor slot left to fill.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: How it happened was, we originally asked Fischl to be an instructor, but she was busy with something outside of Mondstadt during this period. So we found another adventurer to fill in for her, but they still haven't shown up yet...
Media:vo eqxs101 6 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: Thank goodness you are here. *sigh*
Media:vo eqxs101 6 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Good, good. Then everything is settled. Thank you for your help, Eula.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: (Traveler), if anybody else signs up later, I may have to ask for your help as well.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 01.ogg Eula: Build... a snowman?
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 02.ogg Eula: Amber, you're being far too formal. The child is never going to remember all that.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 03.ogg Eula: Please, just call me Eula.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 04.ogg Eula: Aunty... Eula...
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 05.ogg Eula: ...Alright, if that's what you want to call me, go right ahead.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 06.ogg Eula: Amber, what's this I hear about a snowman? I came to assist because you told me the Adventurers' Guild was short-handed.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 07.ogg Eula: ...
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 08.ogg Eula: No, nothing like that. My mind was on something else, that's all. Building a snowman with Joel, are we? Sounds wonderful. I'd be delighted to join you.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 09.ogg Eula: Umm... ahem, ahem...
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 10.ogg Eula: Joel probably hasn't spent much of his life in the city.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 11.ogg Eula: He doesn't know me... and he doesn't know what the Lawrence name means to people in Mondstadt.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 12.ogg Eula: ...True. In his eyes, I'm just another ordinary person from Mondstadt.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 13.ogg Eula: It was a surprise, but not in a bad way at all.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 14a 1.ogg Eula: Indeed. It's just...
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 14a 2.ogg Eula: *sigh* That's the thing. I'm a little worried that I won't be up to the challenge.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 14b 1.ogg Eula: Hm. How very perceptive of you.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 14b 2.ogg Eula: Were you staring at me the whole time when everyone was talking? You shan't be getting off lightly for that.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 14b 3.ogg Eula: The truth is, I'm a little concerned that I might be quite inept at building snowmen.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 15.ogg Eula: I have never built a snowman before. My upbringing was very strict, so I never had the chance when I was a child.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 16.ogg Eula: And after I grew up, of course, it's not the sort of thing I would spend my time doing.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 17.ogg Eula: ...You sound confident. Alright then.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 18.ogg Eula: Enough small talk for now. I see we have a member of the Adventurers' Guild joining us.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 19.ogg Eula: In that case...
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 20.ogg Eula: ...
Media:vo eqxs101 6 eula 21.ogg Eula: Fine. But for that, you will pay.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 gerald 01.ogg Gerald: Oh, hello. My name is Gerald, I'm a new adventurer...
Media:vo eqxs101 6 gerald 02.ogg Gerald: Huh? P—Pay for what? ...
Media:vo eqxs101 6 gerald 03.ogg Gerald: Okay, I—I got it. I'm ready and willing to learn!
Media:vo eqxs101 6 joel 01.ogg Joel: Hi, everyone. Haha, I'm so happy right now! It's nice to have so many people to hang out with.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 joel 02.ogg Joel: Are you here to build a snowman, too?
Media:vo eqxs101 6 joel 03.ogg Joel: Okay, Aunty Eula! You can call me Joel.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 joel 04.ogg Joel: Aunty Eula, are you too busy to join in?
Media:vo eqxs101 6 joel 05.ogg Joel: If so, it's okay, I understand...
Media:vo eqxs101 6 joel 06.ogg Joel: Yeah! Let's do it!
Media:vo eqxs101 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh oh, Eula's gonna add that to her long list of scores to settle...
Media:vo eqxs101 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whoa, Eula just let something go for once!
Media:vo eqxs101 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yup yup, count Paimon in, too! Paimon wants to build a snowman.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wow, those two are fast.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: It's hard to tell which of them is having more fun.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hey, what's up with you two? Why are you just staring at each other without saying anything?
Media:vo eqxs101 6 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Right, that's why he calls you Aunty Eula.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Oh no, Paimon's starting to feel sorry for Eula.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Why did you give the spot to Eula?
Media:vo eqxs101 6 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Ohh, okay. Hehe, you're so nice. Paimon noticed Eula smiled just now, it must have meant a lot to her.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: To be honest, Eula really is the best candidate for an instructor. Most people would find it hard to cope on the mountain 'cause of the sheer cold, but not her.
Media:vo eqxs101 6 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Oh! Now Paimon gets it, this must be the whole reason why Amber got Eula involved in the first place!
Media:vo eqxs101 6 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: We were supposed to find supplies, but now Eula's busy with other stuff and Paimon doesn't feel like going around collecting things... How do you think Amber and Joel are doing? Let's head up the mountain and see what they're up to!
Media:vo eqxs101 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Strange. Didn't they say they were going this way? Where the heck are they?
Media:vo eqxs101 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Did we get here too late? Have they moved on already?
Media:vo eqxs101 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Uh... C—Could they be in danger!?
Media:vo eqxs101 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hurry! Let's go check it out!
Media:vo eqxs101 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's coming from that direction!
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 01.ogg ???: I know that voice...
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: What brings you to Dragonspine?
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: "All along"...? What do you mean by that?
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: The things you felt and heard could easily be attributed to animals, or bandits perhaps. You should be wary at all times in this environment — there are all too many ways to sustain losses here if you aren't careful.
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: So. What business brought you here?
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: Hmm. Your thought process is rather chaotic, as is the way in which you articulate it.
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: Oh? Is that so?
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: Then it must surely be something of great importance. I'm all ears.
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: It's okay if you can't tell me about it. Just treat this as an opportunity to stroll on the mountain and enjoy the view.
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: I see. So, you foisted the rookie off onto Eula, so that you could wander off and goof around?
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: A friend commissioned me to do some artwork recently, and I have yet to finish. I came here because it's a quiet place where I can gather my thoughts, gather inspiration — and gather some raw materials while I'm at it.
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: Paint.
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 13.ogg Albedo: Starsilver can be used to make high-quality silver paint. I just ran out of my previous batch, so I'll collect some ore while I'm here.
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 14.ogg Albedo: Yes. But you have to be selective with the specimens you choose.
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 15.ogg Albedo: Even with a high level of impurities, Starsilver still contains fine silver-colored particles. But they lack luster, which impacts the color saturation of the pigment made from them. Paint made with such pigment is generally viewed as a fake or a defective product.
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 16.ogg Albedo: You want to learn to paint?
Media:vo eqxs101 9 albedo 17.ogg Albedo: Not a bad idea. Well, since you two would like to learn more about painting, why don't you come with me to the campsite? I have painting materials there. You can practice while I give you some guidance.
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: The sound has completely stopped...
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: How could that happen? After all the adventures we've been on, our tracking skills are honed to perfection, aren't they?
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Guess we underestimated whatever was behind it, but if that's the case... then what exactly are we dealing with here?
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hmm? Huh?
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Ohh! So it was Albedo all along!
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: On the way here, we kept hearing weird noises and it felt like someone was watching us the whole time... Turns out it was just you.
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Honestly, you really gave us the creeps! If you're bored up here, go find something useful to do — don't go sneaking around and scaring the poop out of people!
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: We actually came to look for you, but then it turned into looking for Amber, but now we've met you, so we're back to that again...
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Hey! How dare you! All Paimon's trying to say is that we came here to look for you!
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: He seems to be in a better mood than we thought, right? Does that mean Timaeus' stupidity doesn't really get to him after all?
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Huh... Okay, let's... let's just forget that ever came up!
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Hehehe. So basically, the truth is we're here on adventurer duty.
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: We're not goofing around! And Eula was the right person for the job — we were just being nice.
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: What about you, then, huh? What're you doing on Dragonspine?
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Raw materials for what?
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Ore can be used to make paint?
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Interesting! So paint aside, can you talk about how you find inspiration? Paimon wants to learn!
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: No, no, not for me, for the Traveler. Paimon wants (Traveler) to learn how to paint!
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: During our travels, we sometimes have nights where there's nothing to do. It'd sure be nice to do something memorable rather than just sit around...
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: Painting is a great example, because it can capture a moment in time. So it seems like it's definitely a worthwhile skill to have.
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 21.ogg Paimon: Yep! Why not? Once you've mastered it, you can paint Paimon!
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 22.ogg Paimon: Sounds great!
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 23.ogg Paimon: Oh, she'll be fiiiine! She is a knight of Favonius after all. Let's just forget about all that stuff for now and go with Albedo.
Media:vo eqxs101 9 paimon 24.ogg Paimon: C'mon, let's go! It's so cold out — Paimon wants to get to the camp and warm up by the fire!
Media:vo eqxs102 1 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: From the entrance, the footprints go that way.
Media:vo eqxs102 1 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: The footprints lead up there.
Media:vo eqxs102 1 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: That's why we have to hurry.
Media:vo eqxs102 1 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: Our thief must have jumped from the cliff. Get your wind glider ready. We're going down.
Media:vo eqxs102 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Grr, that thieving... thief!
Media:vo eqxs102 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So they scaled the cliff? Okay, after them!
Media:vo eqxs102 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Footprints on the snow are so hard to notice... It's so easy to lose track completely...
Media:vo eqxs102 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh? The footprints stop here?
Media:vo eqxs102 10 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: My camp is somewhere that we can talk openly without reservation. But before that...
Media:vo eqxs102 10 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Thank you. I appreciate it.
Media:vo eqxs102 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whoa... What a mess...
Media:vo eqxs102 11 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: I've been absorbed in my research lately and haven't attended to the dusting... It's due for a cleaning.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Thank you, both of you.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Now that everything is in order... it's time to talk.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: ...
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: I remember I once told you that you must have questions, and that I would answer them.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: I also said that, while I did not wish to deceive you, there were certain things I could not go into detail on.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: ...
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: I am a synthetic human being... a human forged by human hand. The one who created me, my mother and teacher, her name is Rhinedottir — a researcher from Khaenri'ah, also known as "Gold."
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: When the pinnacle of attainment in alchemy is combined with unimaginably vast learning... the apex achievement is the creation of human life.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: I am indeed somewhat older than my appearance might suggest. But when I came into being, Khaenri'ah had already been destroyed. I have no memories of it.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: My master raised me and taught me everything. Like her, I am a pure alchemist. I live for academic knowledge. Nationality and identity are not what ultimately define us.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: Traveler, what is your general feeling toward Dragonspine? You've visited numerous times now. Would you say it's a... cold, eerie, and melancholy place?
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: Rhinedottir created two miraculous beings. One is me, and the other is the venomous dragon, Durin, who died here.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 13.ogg Albedo: As sons of Rhinedottir, Durin and I are indeed inextricably linked to one another.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 14.ogg Albedo: The phenomenon of our creation defies definition within the scope of a typical human worldview, but if we may tentatively call it "birth"... then yes — we, by extension, are family.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 15.ogg Albedo: That's right.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 16.ogg Albedo: Because of this, whenever strange things happen on Dragonspine, it always makes me wonder. For instance, the feeling of being watched that you described, as well as the sounds you heard... and the one impersonating me that Eula met...
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 17.ogg Albedo: So it seems that you met my impostor, too.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 18.ogg Albedo: Perhaps, Durin's power drives people to madness... But that's merely crude conjecture.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 19.ogg Albedo: Whether someone is impersonating me or there is another, false "me" out there... This is a cursed tale, and it is not one whose weight you should have to bear.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 20.ogg Albedo: Traveler, perhaps you should return to Mondstadt if you have no further business here. The work that lies ahead will occupy me completely, I'm afraid I will be unable to entertain you beyond this point.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 21.ogg Albedo: ...Alright. Thank you.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 22.ogg Albedo: You were intending to participate in that winter camp, if I recall correctly? That could serve as an excellent pretext for you to remain on the mountain.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 23.ogg Albedo: In that case, please join in the activities of the Adventurers' Guild as planned, and be on the lookout for any leads while you're at it. If anyone sees "me," or someone like me...
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 24.ogg Albedo: Good. Then we're agreed.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 25.ogg Albedo: Sounds good to me.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 albedo 26.ogg Albedo: But please, whatever happens, put your safety first at all times.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yep, that should do it. Neat and tidy.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: You look really serious right now... is this about what happened earlier?
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: A synthetic human!? What the... how the heck does that work?
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: When you say Khaenri'ah, do you mean...
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Durin!? So that makes you guys... brothers?
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Speaking of Durin, Paimon remembers that his power was quite special...
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Oh, right! Paimon knows what you mean!
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: When Eula and the others were here just now, (Traveler) gave me a look as if to say, "Don't say anything." Probably because it would only make you more suspicious. So Paimon kept quiet...
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: But Paimon noticed that you came out of the cavern not too long after going in, and you told us that you didn't manage to catch the thief.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Then, we heard Bennett calling for help so we went to rescue him. But strangely, you didn't come with us, and when we got back to the cavern to go find you, suddenly you were the one looking for us.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Well if so, it was a pretty good impression... he had you down to a T. We never would've guessed.
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Also, after he left us, why did he go after Joel?
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Yeah! We're Dragonspine veterans by now!
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: If there's something really bad going on, we can't just leave you here to deal with it all on your own. That wouldn't be very nice, now, would it?
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Besides, there's no one else in Mondstadt that you can talk to about this. Sucrose and Timaeus don't know your secret...
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Yeah. Don't push us away at a time like this!
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: We'll be sure to pass the info straight onto you!
Media:vo eqxs102 12 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Okay, let's split up to look for clues, then meet back here at this camp in a few days' time!
Media:vo eqxs102 2 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Here. More footprints.
Media:vo eqxs102 2 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Wait, I have an idea.
Media:vo eqxs102 2 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: I'll go in alone. Traveler, please stay here and guard the entrance.
Media:vo eqxs102 2 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: This cavern has two points of entry, and there are shortcuts inside. Judging from the state of the footprints, he hasn't been in there long. I should be able to reach the other side before he does.
Media:vo eqxs102 2 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: Whoever apprehends the thief first has to notify the other party. This way, we're fully covered.
Media:vo eqxs102 2 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: Still, safety comes first. We do not yet know the identity of our thief. Please take care.
Media:vo eqxs102 2 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: Okay. See you shortly.
Media:vo eqxs102 2 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: Of course.
Media:vo eqxs102 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: They're heading to the cavern? Ooh hoo-hoo, we got you now! You sure can run, but you definitely can't hide!
Media:vo eqxs102 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's go in!
Media:vo eqxs102 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Cut him off at both ends. Good idea!
Media:vo eqxs102 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: We'll be fine!
Media:vo eqxs102 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: I wonder if Albedo found the thief... This is taking forever...
Media:vo eqxs102 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Really? Huh, maybe it just feels like a long time because Paimon hates waiting... Waiting is so boring.
Media:vo eqxs102 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Why don't we find something to do to pass the time? Y'know, something like... something like...
Media:vo eqxs102 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Oh! Look at all that Starsilver over there. Why don't we gather it up for Albedo?
Media:vo eqxs102 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: It's right next to the cavern, so we won't be going far. If anything happens inside, we can be right back here in no time.
Media:vo eqxs102 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Yay, let's get started!
Media:vo eqxs102 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, this one's not bad!
Media:vo eqxs102 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh, this stuff looks kinda... lackluster... is that because of the impurities, like Albedo was talking about?
Media:vo eqxs102 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Alright, this should be enough... Some Starsilvers shine a lot more brightly than others, huh.
Media:vo eqxs102 4 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Yes.
Media:vo eqxs102 4 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Sorry, I was unable to catch him. He was faster than I had imagined.
Media:vo eqxs102 4 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Mining?
Media:vo eqxs102 4 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: ...Starsilver...
Media:vo eqxs102 4 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: Haha, I was merely saying what was on the front of my mind. I hadn't thought you would genuinely go and gather some.
Media:vo eqxs102 4 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: ...Yes, it's all the thief's fault.
Media:vo eqxs102 4 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: The notes mean a lot to me. I'm not quite ready to give up the search yet. Let's keep an eye out for clues as we go.
Media:vo eqxs102 4 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: ...
Media:vo eqxs102 4 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: Indeed, the sorting process is necessary. Humans are such practical creatures. They only want those things that are good. Once they have learned to distinguish between good and bad, they will never stop comparing things in their minds.
Media:vo eqxs102 4 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: Useless things should be disposed of at the outset.
Media:vo eqxs102 4 bennett 01.ogg ???: ...Help! Help me!
Media:vo eqxs102 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Finally, you're back!
Media:vo eqxs102 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: O—Oh... So, after all that, we still don't even know who the thief was... Ugh, what a waste.
Media:vo eqxs102 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Still, we won't be going back completely empty-handed. We did some mining!
Media:vo eqxs102 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Yeah, for Starsilver! Look, we got quite a lot!
Media:vo eqxs102 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: It's just like you said — some are really bright and shiny, and others just look like regular lumps of rock with a little shiny bit here or there.
Media:vo eqxs102 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Well, you said they can be turned into paint, so we got pretty curious!
Media:vo eqxs102 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Also, if it weren't for that thief, we'd be making paint by now anyway, right? Or even painting by this point.
Media:vo eqxs102 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Anyway. It's all the thief's fault for wasting our time!
Media:vo eqxs102 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Oh, just one thing — do you want us to bring all of this ore back? Or did you wanna sort through and get rid of the useless bits first?
Media:vo eqxs102 4 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: There's no point bringing the bad ones back if it'll ruin the quality of the paint. Some of them do look pretty dull to Paimon, so it doesn't seem like those'll be of any use at all.
Media:vo eqxs102 4 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Right, it saves a lot of time that way. Efficiency first! So let's start by...
Media:vo eqxs102 4 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Wait, did you guys hear that? Was that... a cry for help?
Media:vo eqxs102 4 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: It's likely an adventurer in danger!
Media:vo eqxs102 4 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Okay!
Media:vo eqxs102 5 bennett 01.ogg ???: Is anybody there!? Help me!
Media:vo eqxs102 5 bennett 02.ogg ???: Hmm? Is that the Traveler and Paimon!? It's me, Bennett!
Media:vo eqxs102 5 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: So sorry to trouble you guys again... The key should be someplace nearby, please help me find it!
Media:vo eqxs102 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: The voice was definitely coming from around here!
Media:vo eqxs102 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: No way, is that..
Media:vo eqxs102 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Whoa, it's really him...
Media:vo eqxs102 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Let's get him out!
Media:vo eqxs102 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow, so much clutter... We're not gonna find the key here, surely?
Media:vo eqxs102 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh oh, we got company!
Media:vo eqxs102 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, so they kept the key with them! Huh, we were searching around for nothing!
Media:vo eqxs102 8 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Finally, I'm out. Thank you so much!
Media:vo eqxs102 8 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: If only there hadn't been rocks mixed in with the snow on the tree, it wouldn't have made me all dizzy when it fell down onto my head, and then I would've never walked into the Fatui's trap...
Media:vo eqxs102 8 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: Haha, I won't bore you with the rest of the details. Just me being unlucky again.
Media:vo eqxs102 8 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: You did? Hahahaha, that's so nice of you guys!
Media:vo eqxs102 8 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: I know they were probably just following orders... but still, thanks for helping me out!
Media:vo eqxs102 8 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: Did you hear about the Adventurers' Guild thing? They're hosting a winter camp here. As one of their veteran adventurers, I'm here to help out the rookies.
Media:vo eqxs102 8 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: Razor's not an adventurer, and as the leader of Benny's Adventure Team as well as the only actual member, I had to come on my own.
Media:vo eqxs102 8 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: But now I've been stuck here for so long, I've probably missed it... I hope Cyrus doesn't get mad at me...
Media:vo eqxs102 8 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: What!?
Media:vo eqxs102 8 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: Weren't they short on instructors? Where'd they suddenly get extras from?
Media:vo eqxs102 8 bennett 11.ogg Bennett: Knights of Favonius... Yeah, they're definitely more reliable than me — I'm just a walking accident waiting to happen...
Media:vo eqxs102 8 bennett 12.ogg Bennett: ...Really?
Media:vo eqxs102 8 bennett 13.ogg Bennett: Albedo? You mean the alchemist from the Knights of Favonius? He's one of the instructors, too?
Media:vo eqxs102 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Bennett... in a cage... never saw that coming!
Media:vo eqxs102 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yep. Taking them out was child's play. No need to thank us!
Media:vo eqxs102 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So what are you doing on Dragonspine? Didn't Razor wanna come with you?
Media:vo eqxs102 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Ohh... Wait, so that guy Gerald, who got left in the lurch — he was supposed to be paired up with you?
Media:vo eqxs102 8 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: If so... sorry, Bennett, but you really did miss it. He got paired up with a different instructor instead.
Media:vo eqxs102 8 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: A few people from the Knights of Favonius stepped up in order to help support the event. So they ended up with more instructors than students.
Media:vo eqxs102 8 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Right, right. Anyway, that was just the situation when we last saw them, it might've changed by now. Who knows, maybe a whole load more rookies will have turned up to join in!
Media:vo eqxs102 8 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Besides, after all the trouble you've gone to show up as an instructor, Paimon's sure Cyrus will put you to work.
Media:vo eqxs102 8 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: For sure!
Media:vo eqxs102 8 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Hey, wait a second... Where'd Albedo go?
Media:vo eqxs102 8 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: No, he just happened to be on Dragonspine. We were just with him, but then we heard you calling for help... he must have left us at some point after that.
Media:vo eqxs102 8 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Hmm, could he have gone back to keep looking for clues?
Media:vo eqxs102 8 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Let's go back to the cavern and see if he's there.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 01.ogg ???: What are you talking about?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: I should be the one to ask you that. Didn't I tell you to stay at the cavern entrance?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: No, no... Bennett, this is not because of you. You needn't blame yourself.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: Traveler, clear this up for me — what was the reason that you left the cavern entrance? Did you—
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: ...Me?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: ...
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: ...
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: I see. Interesting.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: Eula, it sounds like you met an impostor. Someone who was impersonating me.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: It is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion for now. But these strange incidents do seem to be connected.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: As things stand, I don't have any reason to harm the child. Whoever you met is likely to be both the thief who stole my notes and also an impostor.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: Of course, it's entirely natural for you to be skeptical of my story.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 13.ogg Albedo: I was separated from the Traveler and Paimon for a significant duration while we were pursuing the thief. My word alone cannot serve as a definitive account of my actions and whereabouts during that period.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 14.ogg Albedo: But the Traveler and Paimon can at least testify that I was not the individual who tore up the campsite or stole my notes.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 15.ogg Albedo: I don't have any enemies, and I'm not aware of having given anyone cause to exact vengeance upon me.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 16.ogg Albedo: There is insufficient evidence to assert what happened with any certainty at this point. Given how serious the situation is, I intend to investigate it myself, even if you decide not to pursue it any further.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 17.ogg Albedo: Eula, I won't discourage your ongoing suspicion of me if you can't believe my story. Though naturally, I would hope you can afford me some credibility on account of our solidarity as fellow members of the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 18.ogg Albedo: Traveler, Paimon, Bennett, if you are willing, I welcome you to monitor my activities beyond this point so that you can act as my witnesses.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 19.ogg Albedo: If I am what this impostor wants, he will come looking for me again eventually. Things can only become clearer from that point on.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 20.ogg Albedo: You have my gratitude.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 21.ogg Albedo: Traveler, can we talk somewhere else? There is something I need to tell you.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 albedo 22.ogg Albedo: Let's go to my camp.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 ambor 01.ogg ???: Eula! EUUULAAA! Where are you!!!
Media:vo eqxs102 9 ambor 02.ogg Amber: Eula! Oh, and Traveler, Paimon, Albedo, and Bennett, you're all together! Great!
Media:vo eqxs102 9 ambor 03.ogg Amber: Bennett, I'm glad I ran into you here. Cyrus was telling me you still hadn't shown up. He was getting worried you might've run into some trouble.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 ambor 04.ogg Amber: Sure thing. Well, that now that I've found you, let's go check in with Cyrus.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 ambor 05.ogg Amber: But before that — has something come up? How come you're all gathered here together? Need any help?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 ambor 06.ogg Amber: So, it's all set then? Great. Shall we head back down together? I did say I'd bring Bennett back if I saw him.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: This is great, Dragonspine's so fun today! There's so many people around — it's never usually like this.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Wait, what!?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: I'm not really following who was waiting for who, and who was looking for who... But, first things first!
Media:vo eqxs102 9 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: I apologize, Albedo. I don't fully understand what's going on, but it seems like it's mostly my fault...
Media:vo eqxs102 9 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: Albedo, do you have any enemies? Could it be one of your enemies impersonating you to get revenge on you or something?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: Haha... Yeah, I ran into a little trouble... thanks for your concern.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: Oh! Uh, yeah, hehe, it's my fault really, all because of my bad luck. But everything is fine now!
Media:vo eqxs102 9 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: Sure, I'm ready to go!
Media:vo eqxs102 9 eula 01.ogg ???: There you are!
Media:vo eqxs102 9 eula 02.ogg Eula: Stay right there. You have a lot of explaining to do.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 eula 03.ogg Eula: Hmph, yes, that's what I would be doing — if I hadn't been interrupted by a certain someone's malicious scheming.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 eula 04.ogg Eula: Albedo, I saw you taking Joel towards the wasteland at the edge of Dragonspine. That place is crawling with monsters. What the devil do you think you were doing?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 eula 05.ogg Eula: When I came to stop you from leading Joel any further, your first reaction was to throw the child down and attack me. When I fought back, you quickly fled. Care to explain?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 eula 06.ogg Eula: "Interesting"?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 eula 07.ogg Eula: Impersonating you...? To what end?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 eula 08.ogg Eula: Your alchemy notes were stolen? Can the Traveler and Paimon testify that the three of you were together up until you entered the cavern?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 eula 09.ogg Eula: ...
Media:vo eqxs102 9 eula 10.ogg Eula: I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, as preposterous as your claims sound, and I will choose to believe that an impostor went after Joel, and not you.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 eula 11.ogg Eula: I will keep Joel safe. If you need any support with the investigation, contact myself and Amber.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 eula 12.ogg Eula: As far as Amber goes, I will...
Media:vo eqxs102 9 eula 13.ogg Eula: Amber, we're here!
Media:vo eqxs102 9 eula 14.ogg Eula: Between us, there have been a few minor incidents. But nothing I haven't already dealt with.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 eula 15.ogg Eula: ...Very well. Let's go.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Still no sign of Albedo. This is weird, where has he run off to?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: This was where we heard Bennett's cry for help... right?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We heard his voice and went straight over to rescue him. Then we noticed Albedo was gone... Huh! So he just... didn't feel like helping us save Bennett!?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Albedo! Where the heck have you been? We've been looking for you!
Media:vo eqxs102 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: ...Huh?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Huh, Eula? Aren't you supposed to be helping the new guy?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Whoa, whoa, wait a second... What's going on!? Actually, wrong question — how much stuff is going on...?
Media:vo eqxs102 9 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Yes, we can confirm that.
Media:vo eqxs102 9 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: And then there were three.
Not content to accept her fate, Eula has chosen to face the hostility of others head-on, and to prove with her blade that the noble spirit forsaken by her predecessors is alive and well in her.
Should you meet this bold knight, be sure to cast aside your reservations and greet her courteously. She, in turn, will be sure to extend the utmost courtesy to you.
So infamous is his bad luck that other adventurers are rarely willing to team up with him. Yet Bennett has grown used to being alone and doesn't let it discourage him. No matter how many injuries he may suffer, his fiery passion for adventure burns on.
The Lawrence Clan's oppressive rule plunged Mondstadt into one of the darkest periods of its history. Today, they have long since fallen from grace, but their present-day descendants still find themselves held in contempt for the transgressions of their forefathers.
You examine the cavern entrance...: The cavern entrance is rather narrow, and can barely allow one person to pass through at a time. Albedo has already gone within in pursuit of the culprit, so you might as well wait for him outside, just as he asked.
You tell Albedo about the event that the Adventurers' Guild is holding...
Young Bennett is one of the most passionate adventurers in Mondstadt. He is also by far the least fortunate...
