 A study on... uh, what?
Hosseini: It will be an epoch-defining study! By conducting a sequence of tests adopting a phase-wise approach, I will examine localized energy transfer and transformation within the Irminsul Fruit during a single developmental cycle, in the hope of isolating and identifying the defining features of Irminsul energetics...
Yingzhu: ...Please, Hosseini. We don't understand a word you are saying...
 By defeating the monsters first.
 Goodbye.
Hosseini: Yes, it's "Goodbye, thesis" for me... *sigh* Never mind.
 Goodbye.
Yingzhu: We greatly appreciate your ongoing support in this matter, Traveler. Safe travels, and ad astra abyssosque!
 Irminsul Fruits can explode?
 Mmm, I could have done better.
Hosseini: Very modest of you to say so. I cannot thank you enough for your phenomenal efforts in the pursuit of wisdom.
 Quest DescriptionYingzhu of the Adventurers' Guild has been having dealings with a scholar from the Sumeru Akademiya, but things seem to be going downhill, fast...
 So. Still an undergraduate, huh?
Hosseini: Ahem... Let's not concern ourselves with trivial details like that. Suffice to say, there are those of us at the Akademiya who are fortunate enough to undergo a... prolonged period of scrutiny by the God of Wisdom.
Yingzhu: I'm not educated by any description, but I think Soraya from Wangshu Inn told me something about this... "deferred graduation," isn't it?
 Sounds like you've been dealt quite a tough hand.
Hosseini: *sigh* I don't even know if I'll be able to get my travel expenses reimbursed by this point. Getting here from the Akademiya was exorbitantly expensive.
Hosseini: The Irminsul Fruit is more than just my thesis topic. It's a major area of interest for my supervisor... Ahem, I mean, for the Akademiya.
Hosseini: So as well as delaying my research, it also means I've failed to complete my assignment. It's all a great big mess...
 Sure, happy to help.
 Understood.
 What did you expect? I'm a champion fighter.
Hosseini: Haha, you certainly are, my friend, you certainly are.
 What's an Energy Amplifier?
 What's wrong?
 What's wrong?
Hosseini: Can you believe it? One minute, a priceless research material is almost within my grasp... the next, it's exploded, and that's that.
Hosseini: My sole purpose in coming all this way to Liyue was to retrieve this Irminsul Fruit. What a waste of a trip!
Hosseini: How could that happen?
 What's wrong?
Yingzhu: Huh, so you weren't paying attention last time, then?
Yingzhu: Basically, Sumeru Akademiya commissioned the Adventurers' Guild to investigate on their behalf, and we found an Irminsul Fruit.
Yingzhu: Judging by the scholars' response, it seemed to be an object of major significance for their research.
Yingzhu: Unfortunately, there was an incident while we were transporting the Irminsul Fruit, and it blew up. That's the long and short of it.
Yingzhu: Hosseini hasn't stopped moaning and groaning about it ever since. Its giving me a real headache...
 Yes.
Hosseini: *sigh* I don't even know if I'll be able to get my travel expenses reimbursed by this point. Getting here from the Akademiya was exorbitantly expensive.
Hosseini: ...
Hosseini: ...Miss Yingzhu, I regret to inform you that I shall be cancelling my commission with the Adventurers' Guild with immediate effect.
Hosseini: ...Never mind, let's move on.
Hosseini: Ahem... Let's not concern ourselves with trivial details like that. Suffice to say, there are those of us at the Akademiya who are fortunate enough to undergo a... prolonged period of scrutiny by the God of Wisdom.
Hosseini: Can you believe it? One minute, a priceless research material is almost within my grasp... the next, it's exploded, and that's that.
Hosseini: Haha, you certainly are, my friend, you certainly are.
Hosseini: Hmm, although.... maybe there's still time to change direction and focus on the Energy Amplifier in my thesis...
Hosseini: How could that happen?
Hosseini: I can't believe the Irminsul Fruit exploded! My research prospects are completely ruined...
Hosseini: I'll give you the Energy Amplifier now. As long as you draw energy from the Irminsul Fruit fragment while exploring the domain, I will receive data on my end.
Hosseini: If my theory is correct, a fragment like this should have attracted a whole horde of dangerous monsters... which begs the question: How did you manage to get your hands on it?
Hosseini: If you're interested, feel free to try it out for yourself.
Hosseini: It will be an epoch-defining study! By conducting a sequence of tests adopting a phase-wise approach, I will examine localized energy transfer and transformation within the Irminsul Fruit during a single developmental cycle, in the hope of isolating and identifying the defining features of Irminsul energetics...
Hosseini: It's a genuine slice of ancient history! An object that can conduct and amplify energy. It's another object of my research.
Hosseini: It's a shame that the Irminsul Fruit broke into so many pieces. I can't take my research any further for the time being.
Hosseini: It's a very straightforward procedure. All you need to do is place the fragments into the Energy Amplifier and take it inside with you. This will activate its energy conduction and amplification effects.
Hosseini: My data collection equipment has recorded everything. You fought sensationally.
Hosseini: My research... My thesis... My assignment from the Akademiya...
Hosseini: My sole purpose in coming all this way to Liyue was to retrieve this Irminsul Fruit. What a waste of a trip!
Hosseini: Oh, really? That's lucky. This is the most energy-rich fragment I've seen so far. I simply must collect some data on it.
Hosseini: Please help me look for more fragments. If you find any larger ones, be sure to let me know.
Hosseini: So as well as delaying my research, it also means I've failed to complete my assignment. It's all a great big mess...
Hosseini: The Irminsul Fruit is more than just my thesis topic. It's a major area of interest for my supervisor... Ahem, I mean, for the Akademiya.
Hosseini: There. It's up to you, now.
Hosseini: This fragment seems a little bigger than of the previous ones we've found. Let me analyze it with the Energy Amplifier and run some numbers.
Hosseini: Time to talk specifics. What I'd like you to do is to head to a domain that we previously discovered and conduct a practical test.
Hosseini: Traveler... How would you like to take on a new commission?
Hosseini: Very modest of you to say so. I cannot thank you enough for your phenomenal efforts in the pursuit of wisdom.
Hosseini: What a terrible, terrible situation... Progress on my thesis will completely grind to a halt...
Hosseini: With this Traveler's help, my undergraduate thesis, "A Study on the Internal Energy Flow of Developing Irminsul Fruit," is saved!
Hosseini: Without you, we never would have made it inside that domain. It's just too perilous.
Hosseini: Yes, it's "Goodbye, thesis" for me... *sigh* Never mind.
Yingzhu: ...
Yingzhu: ...As you can see, Hosseini... very much hopes to continue with his research. To that end, he has commissioned us to search for the fragments of the Irminsul Fruit.
Yingzhu: ...Please, Hosseini. We don't understand a word you are saying...
Yingzhu: ...Really!? That's amazing! Okay then, you will find many places of interest on your Map that we have yet to investigate.
Yingzhu: Ah, hello Traveler. I suppose it can't hurt to tell you.
Yingzhu: Ahem, and in any case — this Traveler is actually one of ours.
Yingzhu: Apparently so... This was also news to us when it occurred.
Yingzhu: Basically, Sumeru Akademiya commissioned the Adventurers' Guild to investigate on their behalf, and we found an Irminsul Fruit.
Yingzhu: By using the Energy Amplifier to challenge domains that even I wouldn't dare enter, you will be able to provide Hosseini with further data. I have no doubt that this will be of great service to him.
Yingzhu: Goodness... I had no idea there were such energy-rich fragments out there. None of the other fragments we've found so far are anything like as big as this one.
Yingzhu: Have you found any fragments?
Yingzhu: Hosseini hasn't stopped moaning and groaning about it ever since. Its giving me a real headache...
Yingzhu: Hosseini, the situation is not as bad as it could be...
Yingzhu: However...
Yingzhu: Huh, so you weren't paying attention last time, then?
Yingzhu: I'm not educated by any description, but I think Soraya from Wangshu Inn told me something about this... "deferred graduation," isn't it?
Yingzhu: I'm sure we can figure this whole thing out...
Yingzhu: Judging by the scholars' response, it seemed to be an object of major significance for their research.
Yingzhu: My apologies once again, Mr. Hosseini. The Adventurers' Guild will not shirk our responsibility to you for the incident.
Yingzhu: One of them attacked the cart carrying the Irminsul Fruit and... it exploded.
Yingzhu: Recently, the Adventurers' Guild was commissioned by the Akademiya to investigate a ruin, where we found a perfectly preserved Irminsul Fruit.
Yingzhu: The Akademiya deemed it to be a high research priority and requested that we hand it over to a scholar sent to collect it — namely, Mr. Hossaini.
Yingzhu: This gentlemen's name is Hosseini. He is a researcher from the Sumeru Akademiya.
Yingzhu: To complicate matters further, the Irminsul Fruit attracted a lot of attention from monsters due to the great power it contains. So, some fragments were seized and taken very far away.
Yingzhu: Traveler, could I trouble you to please gather any further Irminsul Fruit fragments you come across during your travels?
Yingzhu: Traveler, no one is disputing your ability, but please be on your guard in that domain. It's extremely dangerous.
Yingzhu: Traveler, since you are here, perhaps you would be willing to help us gather the Irminsul Fruit fragments?
Yingzhu: Unfortunately, the force of the explosion sent some of the fragments into dangerous areas, where even Guild members are hesitant to venture.
Yingzhu: Unfortunately, there was an incident while we were transporting the Irminsul Fruit, and it blew up. That's the long and short of it.
Yingzhu: Wait! You can't do that, Sumeru Akademiya signed a contract with us!
Yingzhu: We greatly appreciate your ongoing support in this matter, Traveler. Safe travels, and ad astra abyssosque!
Yingzhu: We've been searching non-stop for the last few days, but all we've managed to find are a few tiny bits, no large fragments...
Yingzhu: While transporting the Irminsul Fruit, we were ambushed by Treasure Hoarders.
Yingzhu: Wow. That was quick!
Yingzhu: You have saved the Guild's reputation from a major blow. Thank you, Traveler.
Yingzhu: Your support is greatly appreciated, Traveler. Safe travels, and ad astra abyssosque.
