Paimon: Aaah! It appeared!
Paimon: C'mon, Traveler, find some way to take care of it!
(Kaboomball Kombat Tutorial)
Paimon: He played with Klee for a while before saying that he wanted to go have a look around.
Paimon: Huh, why's there a canvas here?
Paimon: Is this Albedo's latest work? If you look closely, it does look similar to the gift that Alice left for Klee.
Paimon: Let's look for him!
Paimon: Looks like this was left by Albedo... whoa, this looks like one fierce fella.
Paimon: Maybe he's gone off to sketch something again?
Paimon: Speaking of which, what is Albedo doing right now?
