 I don't have a Vision, either.
 Quest DescriptionIn an effort to hone his alchemical skills, Timaeus had designed an all-new alchemical furnace. There's just one problem — he needs some help to get it working...
 So, what do you need me to do?
 What is it?
 You're going back to the origins of the art?
 You're switching to bio-alchemy?
Timaeus: *sigh* Maybe this is why I've never made any tangible progress. The barrier to entry is just too high.
 I don't have a Vision, either.
Timaeus: True... But I hear you can still manipulate elemental energy, correct?
 So, what do you need me to do?
Timaeus: I've heard you can manipulate elemental energy even though you don't have a Vision. Is that right?
Timaeus: ...Traveler! Hi! Hold up a second...
Timaeus: As you know, I've never made much progress in my alchemical studies...
Timaeus: Do you know what the most important factor in alchemy is? It's the elements.
Timaeus: Everything is set up and ready to go. All I'm missing now is someone with the ability to actually move the pure elemental energy around.
Timaeus: For a number of reasons, alchemy is mostly performed using items infused with elemental energy, rather than pure elemental energy itself.
Timaeus: Here's the thing: I've come up with a new kind of alchemical furnace which I call the Elemental Crucible. The idea behind it is...
Timaeus: I really hope this will be my big breakthrough in alchemy...
Timaeus: I've heard you can manipulate elemental energy even though you don't have a Vision. Is that right?
Timaeus: If you're willing to help out, please meet me at the Thousand Winds Temple. That's where I had some people set everything up.
Timaeus: Let's fire it up and see if it works.
Timaeus: Naturally, this introduces impurities into the transmutation process, making the elemental reactions less effective...
Timaeus: Okay, so... I'm sorry about this, but... there's something I really need your help with.
Timaeus: So, I decided I'd change focus. Take a fresh approach. Attempt something that's not been done before...
 You're switching to bio-alchemy?
Timaeus: There's nothing particularly new about bio-alchemy. There are already people researching that.
 You're going back to the origins of the art?
Timaeus: You mean study the alchemical arts of the ancients? No, that's not something I'd be able to get involved in...
Timaeus: The biggest issue is that items infused with alchemical elemental energy do not come cheap.
Timaeus: The bill for the average transmutation is more astonishing than the fruits of our labor...
Timaeus: There you are. So, here it is – the Elemental Crucible.
Timaeus: There's nothing particularly new about bio-alchemy. There are already people researching that.
Timaeus: To compensate, we must use larger quantities of elemental materials. Even then, we still need to be very hands-on during the transmutation process, as the impurities can easily ruin the outcome.
Timaeus: True... But I hear you can still manipulate elemental energy, correct?
Timaeus: Unfortunately, this all creates extra costs for those who wish to perform alchemy without using Visions.
Timaeus: Well, I've realized that I can't keep trying the same things over and over again. Clearly, that approach is getting me nowhere.
Timaeus: Well, basically, it's a vessel that can hold pure elemental energy and generate elemental reactions.
Timaeus: With any luck, the Elemental Crucible will be the thing that takes my alchemical skills to the next level...
Timaeus: You mean study the alchemical arts of the ancients? No, that's not something I'd be able to get involved in...
