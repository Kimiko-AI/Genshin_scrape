 Dandelion
Media:vo eqfh004 1 paimon 05a.ogg Paimon: Ahhh... throwing your weight behind one of the people's favorites! Windblumes must be Dandelions after all!
 I enjoy the feeling of freedom, too.
 It's a pleasant atmosphere.
 It's full of love and cheer.
 It's great to be with everyone.

Lisa: Funny, we haven't gotten together for a meal in a while

Media:vo dialog eqfh004 venti 01.ogg Venti: What will the Windblume be this year? I can't wait to find out!
Media:vo eqfh004 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, Jean!
Media:vo eqfh004 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: *sigh* ...Yeah... But with us and the Tone-Deaf Bard here, this year's Windblume Festival is sure to be bigger than ever!
Media:vo eqfh004 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So we choose one type of flower, then offer it to the Anemo Archon, right?
Media:vo eqfh004 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hey! Don't you two go spilling secrets during an occasion like this!
Media:vo eqfh004 1 paimon 05a.ogg Paimon: Ahhh... throwing your weight behind one of the people's favorites! Windblumes must be Dandelions after all!
Media:vo eqfh004 1 paimon 05b.ogg Paimon: Ahhh... throwing your weight behind one of the people's favorites! Windblumes must be Windwheel Asters after all!

Media:vo eqfh004 1 qin 01.ogg Jean: Traveler! Ah â€” excuse me. I should address you as Honorary Knight under the circumstances.
Media:vo eqfh004 1 qin 02.ogg Jean: I suppose you heard? You're this year's Windblume Star. You will be making an offering of Windblumes to the Anemo Archon, Barbatos, on behalf of the whole of Mondstadt.
Media:vo eqfh004 1 qin 03.ogg Jean: ...Although... things will be a little different this time.
Media:vo eqfh004 1 qin 04.ogg Jean: That is true... Thank you for taking up residence in Mondstadt, and I hope you continue to enjoy Mondstadt life.
Media:vo eqfh004 1 qin 05.ogg Jean: Oh! The Windblume Ceremony is about to begin. Windblume Star, have you chosen your Windblume?
Media:vo eqfh004 1 qin 06.ogg Jean: Exactly right. Please consider your choice carefully. Remember, you are representing the whole of Mondstadt.
Media:vo eqfh004 1 qin 07.ogg Jean: Ahem...
Media:vo eqfh004 1 qin 08.ogg Jean: So, Honorary Knight, what is your choice?
Media:vo eqfh004 1 qin 09.ogg Jean: On behalf of the people of Mondstadt, please offer your Windblume to the statue.
Media:vo eqfh004 1 qin 10.ogg Jean: Thank you, Windblume Star, for your sincere Windblume offering to the Anemo Archon, Barbatos. May the wind protect Mondstadt.
Media:vo eqfh004 1 venti 01.ogg Venti: Eh? ...Very cunning, trying to cheat, are we?
Media:vo eqfh004 1 venti 02.ogg Venti: Haha, they told us!
Media:vo eqfh004 1 venti 03.ogg Venti: Don't worry about me, choose something you like! I trust your tastes.
Media:vo eqfh004 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Typical Tone-Deaf Bard, stop making people guess all the time!
Media:vo eqfh004 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Where should we go?
Media:vo eqfh004 2 venti 01.ogg Venti: Huh, interesting choice.
Media:vo eqfh004 2 venti 02.ogg Venti: Hehe, take a guess...
Media:vo eqfh004 2 venti 03.ogg Venti: Ahahahaha! Okay, okay, I'll tell you. But not here though.
Media:vo eqfh004 2 venti 04.ogg Venti: Not a good idea with so many people in the plaza... Change of surroundings needed.
Media:vo eqfh004 2 venti 05.ogg Venti: I want you to come with me to Stormterror's Lair.
Media:vo eqfh004 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, good point... doesn't Dvalin wanna take part in the Windblume Festival too?
Media:vo eqfh004 3 venti 01.ogg Venti: It's been a while since I've come here, and... things have gotten a little out of order.
Media:vo eqfh004 3 venti 02.ogg Venti: Traveler, shall we clear the area up a bit? Let's call it our Windblume gift to Dvalin.
Media:vo eqfh004 3 venti 03.ogg Venti: He's not here, but I sense he'll be back soon.
Media:vo eqfh004 3 venti 04.ogg Venti: ...Right, I'll let you handle that area, I'll take another. Let's meet up top when we're done.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: You mean sit and laze around?
Media:vo eqfh004 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh... it does seem like "Windblume" means something unique to each person.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: So Windblumes... don't really exist?
Media:vo eqfh004 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: You can't see them, but you can feel there presence everywhere... just like the wind!
Media:vo eqfh004 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Guess it's no surprise that the type of flower given by the City of Freedom to it's deity is in itself an expression of freedom.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 01.ogg Venti: Ah... now this is a view
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 02.ogg Venti: Isn't it? I am fond of this place. Sometimes, when I've got nothing else to do, I come here just to sit and gaze a while.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 03.ogg Venti: Hahaha, guilty as charged!
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 04.ogg Venti: ...It's so beautiful... if only we had some cider in hand.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 05.ogg Venti: So, Traveler. Mondstadt Windblume festival. Do you like it?
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 06.ogg Venti: And yet, you still have something you wish to ask, do you not?
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 07.ogg Venti: I know your question. What are Windblumes, exactly? And what do Windblumes and the Windblume Festival mean to Barbatos, the Anemo Archon?
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 08.ogg Venti: As you've seen, the people of Mondstadt each make their own choice. Out of the millions of flowers there are, some choose the dandelion, others choose the Windwheel Aster.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 09.ogg Venti: Correct, and long may that be the case. There is no single and answer and no true Windblumes in existence.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 10.ogg Venti: The word "Windblume" dates from the age of Old Mondstadt. It was a code word that the people used to stay in contact and mount resistance in secret.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 11.ogg Venti: At that time, people often said that the stronger the wind blows, the firmer the roots of the Windblume grow, and the brighter the flower that bursts into bloom.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 12.ogg Venti: If you want my perspective, Windblumes don't exist. Yet they are all around us nonetheless.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 13.ogg Venti: They are the spirit of yearning for freedom, the courage to follow the wind wherever it may lead... All objects are beautiful and worthy of blessing... All can be Windblumes.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 14.ogg Venti: Haha, well said.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 15.ogg Venti: So what are Windblumes? Something that the Anemo Archon Barbatos will not define.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 16.ogg Venti: Flowers of blessings, flowers of respect, flowers of love. Every individual has their own Windblumes and every individual has the right to define them.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 17.ogg Venti: I know.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 18.ogg Venti: It is people's shared will that brings them onto the same page. And surely, it is the wind of freedom that brought us together.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 19.ogg Venti: It comes from the end of the journey, the edge of the world, the depths of our heart. It is ceaseless.
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 20.ogg Venti:
"Who was it that stroked your bloodied, determined visage
By stream flowing small
By boulder standing large"
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 21.ogg Venti:
"Who was it that embraced your weary yet noble soul
In dreams deep
In skies soaring"
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 22.ogg Venti:
"Dear friend
I am leading you by the hand
Into the night where lanterns shine bright"
Media:vo eqfh004 4 venti 23.ogg Venti:
To tell you a tale of freedom and dreams
The tale of where this festival begins"
Media:vo eqfh004 5 venti 01.ogg Venti: Haha, I guess Dvalin found the gift we prepared for him.
Media:vo eqfh004 5 venti 02.ogg Venti: A fresh breeze and a comfortable environment, he'll love it.
Media:vo eqfh004 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: The wind here is in chaos!
Media:vo eqfh004 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We need to find a way to restore the wind's direction.
Media:vo eqfh004 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Okay, that should do it. Let's go find our Tone-Deaf Bard!
Media:vo eqfh004 6 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Something's wrong...
Media:vo eqfh004 6 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Why not try a different order?
Media:vo eqfh004 6 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Huh... These wind currents seem to appear according to a set pattern, maybe we need to check the order.
Rosaria: Really?
(Kaeya reaches out for the bottle of wine and Diluc nonchalantly takes it away; Rosaria and Kaeya become upset)
Sucrose: Mr. Albedo!
Sucrose: We've had a few issues...
The tale of where this festival begins"
Timaeus: Have a look a this. Now, we think...
To tell you a tale of freedom and dreams
Venti (voice-over): How should we do it? Who should we do it for?
Venti (voice-over): Make the first move? Or trust to chance?
Venti (voice-over): My answer is this:
Venti (voice-over): Quietly? Or boldly?
Venti (voice-over): So, if you're asking me...
Venti (voice-over): What should we do, on this day?
Venti: Let the heart decide
(Dvalin flies overhead)
Venti: So long as we can both share fond memories, it doesn't matter
Venti: The Windblume Festival originated in the "Crown of the North, the City of Freedom"
