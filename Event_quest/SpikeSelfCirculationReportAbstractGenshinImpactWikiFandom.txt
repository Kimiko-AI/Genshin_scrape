 Quest DescriptionAssist the researcher from Sumeru in initializing the Pursina's Spike to clear the dark mud from the mining complex of The Chasm.
 The front-line mines.
Hosseini: And in this case, the affected areas also include...
Hosseini: And most importantly, the dark mud was completely cleared.
Hosseini: Exactly, this means that the point through which the dark mud is flowing in is in the tunnels. Such areas will be far more narrow, allowing for greater buildup of the mud, and making it easier for monsters to swarm in, thus worsening our problem.
Hosseini: I do hope that things will go as well when they move the Spike further down into the tunnels.
Hosseini: I don't think that such an opening would have been this easy to clear out, so the true entry point must be elsewhere...
Hosseini: It is, after all, Pursina's great creation.
Hosseini: It's just that, hmm...
Hosseini: Just let me do a bit of maintenance work on it first. I'll call the miners who've agreed to move the Spike into the tunnels over.
Hosseini: Let me think... Well, when Khedive and I analyzed the situation previously, we believed that the opening in the Ley Lines through which the dark mud came should be here.
Hosseini: Speaking of which, those miners are surprisingly reliable. Their footing was incredibly stable as they moved the Spike from the camp to this place.
Hosseini: Still, I have full faith in the Pursina's Spike.
Hosseini: The effects are better than I thought! We've recorded all the phenomena we've seen and the data we've collected...
Paimon: Huh, why do you look so unhappy? Is it a bad thing that the mining complex is all clean?
