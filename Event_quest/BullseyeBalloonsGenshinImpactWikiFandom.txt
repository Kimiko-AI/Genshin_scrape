 First I've heard of it.
 I wouldn't say no to that.
 Quest DescriptionDuring the Windblume Festival, the area around Mondstadt will play host to all sorts of interesting activities. The Knights of Favonius' Lizzie would like to introduce you to one of the highlights of this event â€” "Bullseye Balloons."
 Rings a bell...
 Sounds enticing.
 Sounds quite challenging.
 Thank you for your explanation.
Lizzie: Because some festival events take place outside of the city walls, someone needs to introduce all the available activities to the visitors. It'd be a shame if they missed the abundance of wonderful games that we've prepared.
Lizzie: Besides, based on your score, you can win valuable rewards! No matter if you are a casual player or a perfectionist, it's fun all the same!
Lizzie: Have fun!
Lizzie: Hello, I'm Lizzie of the Knights of Favonius. I'm sure you've heard this already, but Mondstadt holds all kinds of fun activities during the Windblume Festival!
Lizzie: I'm in charge of receiving all guests coming to Mondstadt in order to assure that everyone can get the most fun out of this festival!
Lizzie: No worries, let me mark the location for you. You won't know unless you try it yourself.
Lizzie: Now, allow me to wholeheartedly recommend our "Bullseye Balloons"!
Lizzie: Sure, you should definitely try it! If you want to learn more about other fun events, come find me!
Lizzie: The name itself is pretty self-explanatory, isn't it? Shoot the targets as quickly and as accurately as you can to reach a high score.
