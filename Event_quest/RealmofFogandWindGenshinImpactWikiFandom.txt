 ...
 ...Looks familiar.
 ...Smells familiar.
 Definitely something that Sucrose would like.
 Down-to-earth, plenty of romance too.
 Full of Adventurers' Guild spirit
 Here.
 Hmm...
 How did you get into this mess?
 It's a fun time.
 Mechanism - 1, Bennett - 0
 Must be lonely.
 Quest DescriptionYou and Venti keep pushing on for the sake of some good wine. Cold corners, perilous places, strange sites... who knows what incidents await the two of you? Even more interestingly, you begin to realize that there is no common understanding of what a "Windblume" is.
 Why not just ask the amazing Albedo?
"Hand in hand with you before the furnace
"You and the Mare Jivari
Albedo reads the alchemical recipe...
Albedo walks over to the alchemy table and gets to work...
For they are burning in my heart."
Media:vo dialog eqfh003 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: The recipe itself is from a forgotten era, but the thinking behind it is very innovative. Worth a try.
Media:vo dialog eqfh003 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Ugh, I can't believe someone would come up with such a sinister mechanism!
Media:vo dialog eqfh003 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: I still have an apple in my bag. Here, you can have it.
Media:vo dialog eqfh003 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Hmph... easier said than done.
Media:vo dialog eqfh003 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: I doubt Charles is nimble enough to handle both.
Media:vo dialog eqfh003 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: I was going to say, isn't it about time the tavern menu had a few starters and mains? What's a drink without something on the side?
Media:vo dialog eqfh003 razor 01.ogg Razor: *sigh* Hungry.
Media:vo dialog eqfh003 rosaria 01.ogg Rosaria: ...Taverns are so much more fun than Cathedrals. Speaking of which, doesn't everyone get time off for festivals like this? Why doesn't the Church give us time off?
Media:vo dialog eqfh003 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Hehe! I've got high hopes!
Media:vo dialog eqfh003 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Ancient alchemical methods are very complicated... I hope Mr. Albedo is able to decipher it!.
Media:vo eqfh003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We're here! Timaeus' alchemy store.
Media:vo eqfh003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So... did you do your homework, Timaeus? Hehehe... Paimon wants to hear it!
Media:vo eqfh003 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Eh? Is alchemy really that mysterious?
Media:vo eqfh003 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Ooh! What if the Windblume isn't a naturally occurring plant after all, but an alchemical creation!?
Media:vo eqfh003 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Windblume, the flower that alchemy made... Sounds exciting, Paimon needs to know the truth!
Media:vo eqfh003 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Let's get going, Albedo, here we come!
Media:vo eqfh003 1 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Timaeus! Might I ask how you're progressing?
Media:vo eqfh003 1 sucrose 02a.ogg Sucrose: Huh? Traveler and friends! Oh, nice to see you again!
Media:vo eqfh003 1 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: So, in other words... no progress?
Media:vo eqfh003 1 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: Ohh... Now that you mention it, I can't figure it out either.
Media:vo eqfh003 1 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: Yes! That was my thinking too, but I believe that Mr. Albedo is still painting on the mountain, and we've got lots of research to do... *sigh* There's no getting around it.
Media:vo eqfh003 1 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: It's a Windblume recipe I transcribed from an ancient book.
Media:vo eqfh003 1 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: You misunderstand, the book doesn't say anything about it being a recipe for a Windblume! The book... *sigh* Well, actually... it doesn't exactly have the appearance of a book anymore.
Media:vo eqfh003 1 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: It's badly damaged and lots of information is missing. Only a few pages of scattered notes from the original volume have survived. That and a recipe written in some unknown language.
Media:vo eqfh003 1 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: The author mentioned in the notes that the recipe was extremely precious. Timaeus and I are completely unable to decipher the content.
Media:vo eqfh003 1 sucrose 10.ogg Sucrose: I know it might seem inconceivable, b—but... something about it being "extremely precious" made me think of Windblumes.
Media:vo eqfh003 1 sucrose 11.ogg Sucrose: Traveler, if I may be so bold...
Media:vo eqfh003 1 sucrose 12.ogg Sucrose: Could you take this recipe to Mr. Albedo?
Media:vo eqfh003 1 timaeus 01.ogg Timaeus: Oh, did you say my name?
Media:vo eqfh003 1 timaeus 02.ogg Timaeus: Uh... So sorry, I haven't gotten around to it yet...
Media:vo eqfh003 1 timaeus 03.ogg Timaeus: Sucrose has me deciphering an alchemical recipe, but my brain is doing backflips. I... I just don't understand it!
Media:vo eqfh003 1 timaeus 04.ogg Timaeus: *sigh* No.
Media:vo eqfh003 1 timaeus 05.ogg Timaeus: If you want my opinion, if Mr. Albedo can't figure out this recipe, nobody in Teyvat can. *sigh* Sucrose, what exactly is this recipe, anyway?
Media:vo eqfh003 1 timaeus 06.ogg Timaeus: Huh? But...
Media:vo eqfh003 1 timaeus 07.ogg Timaeus: Mr. Albedo should be at the camp at the foot of the mountain.
Media:vo eqfh003 1 venti 01.ogg Venti: Looks like I beat you here.
Media:vo eqfh003 1 venti 02.ogg Venti: But of course! Alchemy is an ancient and mystical discipline. Yet with the passage of time, those that can be said to have mastered its secrets go fewer and further between.
Media:vo eqfh003 1 venti 03.ogg Venti: Oh! Now that's an interesting take on the Windblume conundrum.
Media:vo eqfh003 1 venti 04.ogg Venti: Haha, that's an active imagination.
Media:vo eqfh003 1 venti 05.ogg Venti: Ahh, the mountain. Now there's a romantic location!
Media:vo eqfh003 2 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Oh? Traveler and Paimon? And who might this be?
Media:vo eqfh003 2 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Greetings, I'm Albedo the alchemist.
Media:vo eqfh003 2 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Well, with the Windblume Festival in full swing, as you say, why would you be out here looking for me?
Media:vo eqfh003 2 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: A Windblume recipe?
Media:vo eqfh003 2 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: I see. This is ancient language, it's no wonder Sucrose and Timaeus couldn't decipher it.
Media:vo eqfh003 2 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: Even so, I don't believe this is a recipe for a Windblume.
Media:vo eqfh003 2 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: I could only guess, I'm afraid. In order to reach a conclusion, we'll need to see the real thing.
Media:vo eqfh003 2 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: Sadly, my hands are full right now. But I can give you a list of ingredients, if you'd like to go gathering?
Media:vo eqfh003 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Albedo!
Media:vo eqfh003 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: This is our Tone-Deaf Bard!
Media:vo eqfh003 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: The Windblume Festival is in full swing, people celebrating everywhere, and here you are all by yourself.
Media:vo eqfh003 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: We're helping Sucrose!
Media:vo eqfh003 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Sucrose gave us some paper, she says there's a Windblume recipe from an ancient text on it! Neither she nor Timaeus can understanding it, so we came looking for you!
Media:vo eqfh003 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: So what could it be?
Media:vo eqfh003 2 venti 01.ogg Venti: Venti will do just fine, but yes, I am a bard.
Media:vo eqfh003 3 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Great work. Let's have a look, shall we?
Media:vo eqfh003 3 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Hmm, seems we have everything we need. Now for the alchemical process. This shouldn't take long.
Media:vo eqfh003 3 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: There we have it.
Media:vo eqfh003 3 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: Have a closer look. Are you sure it's the same as other Sweet Flowers?
Media:vo eqfh003 3 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: So this is the "Windblume" created by following this ancient recipe.
Media:vo eqfh003 3 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: Haha, it really does make me think of Sucrose.
Media:vo eqfh003 3 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: I can say with certainty that yes, yes they do. Their essence is the same.
Media:vo eqfh003 3 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: There were indeed Sweet Flowers in antiquity. This species has a long history.
Media:vo eqfh003 3 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: Yes.
Media:vo eqfh003 3 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: Well then, I must head further into the mountain — I still have painting to do. Perhaps you could pass this on?
Media:vo eqfh003 3 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: Traveler, enjoy the celebrations.
(Obtain Wondrous Lovely Flower)
Media:vo eqfh003 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uhh... Is this the Windblume that Sucrose was talking about? It...
Media:vo eqfh003 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's just a Sweet Flower!
Media:vo eqfh003 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Uh... now that you mention it, why is this Sweet Flower so big...?
Media:vo eqfh003 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Do Sweet Flowers this size even count as Sweet Flowers anymore?
Media:vo eqfh003 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: But Sucrose said that she transcribed the recipe from an ancient book! Could it be that... there were Sweet Flowers around even in ancient times?
Media:vo eqfh003 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Seriously!? Have Sweet Flowers... r—really existed all that time!?
Media:vo eqfh003 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Whoa!
Media:vo eqfh003 3 venti 01.ogg Venti: Okay! Job done.
Media:vo eqfh003 3 venti 02.ogg Venti: Huh...
Media:vo eqfh003 3 venti 03.ogg Venti: Huh, it does seem like something she would like.
Media:vo eqfh003 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Here's the flower he created, but Albedo said it's just —
Media:vo eqfh003 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: ...It's just a Sweet Flower!
Media:vo eqfh003 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Uh... th—the what now?
Media:vo eqfh003 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Ooooh, here we go — Paimon's favorite part!
Media:vo eqfh003 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Wow... Sounds so romantic... and you even tailored it to your profession! Great job!
Media:vo eqfh003 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hmm....
Media:vo eqfh003 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Aren't we... missing someone?
Media:vo eqfh003 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Hmmmm... Oh!
Media:vo eqfh003 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Where did Bennett run off to?
Media:vo eqfh003 4 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Did you get the Windblume? Let me see, let me see!
Media:vo eqfh003 4 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Wah! It's just like the Windblume in my dreams!
Media:vo eqfh003 4 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: No, no, hear me out! This is a perfect specimen from an ancient recipe. I saw it in my dreams...
Media:vo eqfh003 4 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: The Tetratanic Sweet Flower!
Media:vo eqfh003 4 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: The seeds of the Tetratanic Sweet Flower are four times bigger than those of ordinary Sweet Flowers, and the Sweet Flowers that grow from them are, well, Tetratanic Sweet Flowers.
Media:vo eqfh003 4 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: Bigger, stronger, sweeter, and more beautiful — a perfect Teyvat species! Oh — and not to mention that the recipe comes from remote antiquity...
Media:vo eqfh003 4 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: A perfect, magnificent flower from the far-flung past. Whatever people say, this is my Windblume!
Media:vo eqfh003 4 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: I must go and source some nutrients for my Windblume. Bye for now!
Media:vo eqfh003 4 timaeus 01.ogg Timaeus: Oh! You're back!
Media:vo eqfh003 4 timaeus 02.ogg Timaeus: Sucrose is... consistently Sucrose.
Media:vo eqfh003 4 timaeus 03.ogg Timaeus: Just finished, Sir. Here.
Media:vo eqfh003 4 timaeus 04.ogg Timaeus: Ah!? You're gonna read it out loud? Uhh...
Media:vo eqfh003 4 timaeus 05.ogg Timaeus: Really...? Wow! I had no idea that someone like me could write love poems of any merit. It must have been Professor Venti's excellent guidance.
Media:vo eqfh003 4 timaeus 06.ogg Timaeus: Professor, as soon as I'm done here, I'll sort out my tuition fee!
Media:vo eqfh003 4 venti 01.ogg Venti: Oh, Sucrose! We've got something for you.
Media:vo eqfh003 4 venti 02.ogg Venti: Timaeus, how's that homework coming along?
(Timaeus nods a few times)
Media:vo eqfh003 4 venti 03.ogg Venti: Haha, who knew alchemy could generate such enthusiasm?
Media:vo eqfh003 4 venti 04.ogg Venti: Now, Timaeus... Your homework?
Media:vo eqfh003 4 venti 05.ogg Venti: Timaeus, may I recite it?
Media:vo eqfh003 4 venti 06.ogg Venti: Haha, don't be embarrassed. *clears throat* Here we go~
Media:vo eqfh003 4 venti 07.ogg Venti:
"Hand in hand with you before the furnace
The flames fail to rise
For they are burning in my heart."
Media:vo eqfh003 4 venti 08.ogg Venti: Truly, a masterpiece beyond all expectation, Timaeus. You're a natural!
Media:vo eqfh003 4 venti 09.ogg Venti: Ahh, music to my ears, hehe!
Media:vo eqfh003 4 venti 10.ogg Venti: Now... that's job satisfaction. And I guess that's everyone's homework collected... no?
Media:vo eqfh003 4 venti 11.ogg Venti: Who could that be...
Media:vo eqfh003 5 barbara 01.ogg Barbara: Traveler, Paimon, Mr. Bard!
Media:vo eqfh003 5 barbara 02.ogg Barbara: Something terrible's happened. Bennett's gone missing!
Media:vo eqfh003 5 barbara 03.ogg Barbara: Yes... What if he's in danger? We have no idea where he is...
Media:vo eqfh003 5 barbara 04.ogg Barbara: Huh? Rosaria!
Media:vo eqfh003 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Barbara, we need to ask you something!
Media:vo eqfh003 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh! Paimon remembers now, he said something like... "I've got it! The Thousand Winds Temple!"
Media:vo eqfh003 5 rosaria 01.ogg Rosaria: ...The Thousand Winds Temple.
Media:vo eqfh003 5 rosaria 02.ogg Rosaria: With you all in the Cathedral shouting at the top of your lungs, I could hear everything you were saying.
Media:vo eqfh003 5 venti 01.ogg Venti: Missing? You mean, he hasn't returned after leaving that day?
Media:vo eqfh003 5 venti 02.ogg Venti: There's no time to lose, let's head to the temple and investigate.
Media:vo eqfh003 6 bennett 01.ogg ???: Voices?! Razor, someone's coming! Maybe they're here to save us?
Media:vo eqfh003 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: No trace of Bennett anywhere....
Media:vo eqfh003 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What's that over there?
Media:vo eqfh003 6 venti 01.ogg Venti: Traveler, keep your eyes peeled for enemies...
Media:vo eqfh003 7 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: See what I mean? Even they're surprised by this crazy cell!
Media:vo eqfh003 7 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: There's gotta be a mechanism around here somewhere. Quick, go look for it!
Media:vo eqfh003 7 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: ...You just ate the apple from my bag!
Media:vo eqfh003 7 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: No no no no no, not funny! I'm begging you, alright? Please, find the mechanism!
Media:vo eqfh003 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ah! We're here! Bennett, we've come to the rescue... Whoa, this cell has two sections!
Media:vo eqfh003 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Lucky you two got locked on opposite sides...
Media:vo eqfh003 7 razor 01.ogg Razor: Stomach... rumbling...
(Bennett thinks for a few seconds)
Media:vo eqfh003 7 venti 01.ogg Venti: Huh, what a superior design... and presumably an ancient mechanism is involved somehow?
Media:vo eqfh003 7 venti 02.ogg Venti: You two seem to have adjusted well to life in prison, we can leave you here if you like?
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Ah... Freedom at last!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: Hahaha, I wouldn't call it unexpected. This was just a normal day for me.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: Ah... no need to apologize, it wasn't even your fault.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: Wait, what happened with that letter?
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: What the...
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: That' terrible, what kind of a person does that!? I've been locked up here a whole day thanks to them!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: Don't be, Razor! I—I didn't mean... Like I said, there's nothing to apologize for!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 08.ogg Bennett: It was my fault for being so hasty in the first place. I rushed off without giving the map a proper look and ended up in the completely wrong location... *sigh* After I left the Cathedral, I came straight to the area around the Thousand Winds Temple.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 09.ogg Bennett: But there were monsters everywhere, not to mention Ruin Guards! You know — those huge things, I guess you've seen them before.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 10.ogg Bennett: But as a first-rate adventurer, I was able to rely on my wits to evade them. Then I got to the temple itself...
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 11.ogg Bennett: The moment I arrived here, I heard a monster's roar!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 12.ogg Bennett: I remember thinking it must be some villainous trap the perpetrator had set for us. But was Bennett the adventurer, leader of Benny's Adventure Team about to back down? No way!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 13.ogg Bennett: So I charged straight in! ...That's when I found him inside.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 14.ogg Bennett: Turns out it was no ordinary cell, what with the inner and outer sections. Of course, when I saw that Razor had been trapped inside, I had to rescue him... Then, all of a sudden...
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 15.ogg Bennett: ...There was a huge crash as the other cell door came down.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 16.ogg Bennett: Anyway... why did you come to the Thousand Winds Temple?
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 17.ogg Bennett: Oh! The love poem! Of course I didn't forget!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 18.ogg Bennett: It's not like I had much else to do, being stuck in this cell all day and all night, so at some point I just started working on it. It's all finished now, even Razor reviewed it.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 19.ogg Bennett: Oh... Sure! A taste of Bennett's wordsmanship, hehe.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 20.ogg Bennett: Y—Yeah... Not bad... right?
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 21.ogg Bennett: Thank you, thank you very much, Sir!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 22.ogg Bennett: Haha, thanks to you too, Razor!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 23.ogg Bennett: Oh, that was Razor's addition. I asked him: "What do you think the Windblume is?" Wolfhook was his answer.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 24.ogg Bennett: Ah... I'm so happy, today was lucky.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 25.ogg Bennett: Getting rescued against the odds, receiving praise for my poem... brilliant! Sir, as soon as we're back in Mondstadt, I'll buy you some wine!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 26.ogg Bennett: Hahaha, that's not quite it. I'm always so unlucky... so I'll take what I can get!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 27.ogg Bennett: Hey! You should talk! Hahaha...
Media:vo eqfh003 8 bennett 28.ogg Bennett: I'm afraid Razor and I have to be going. He said he knows some relatively unknown areas worth exploring and wants to show them to me. Have a great time, though!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh! It was just a false alarm, turns out some fans just wanted to get her attention so they could get a gift to her
Media:vo eqfh003 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Well, Paimon's guessed the ending already...
Media:vo eqfh003 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Razor, what were you doing at the Thousand Winds Temple?
Media:vo eqfh003 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Yup, just as Paimon expected.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh yeah? Razor, how did he do?
Media:vo eqfh003 8 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Yay! A round of applause for Bennett!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Uhh... Wolfhook?
Media:vo eqfh003 8 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Uh... it's definitely your style...
Media:vo eqfh003 8 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Congratulations! Nice job!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Still, Wolfhook and dandelion...? Can they both be Windblumes?
Media:vo eqfh003 8 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: So, even berries count now?
Media:vo eqfh003 8 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Bennett's pretty easy to please...
Media:vo eqfh003 8 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Great!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 razor 01.ogg Razor: Very... unexpected...
Media:vo eqfh003 8 razor 02.ogg Razor: Sorry.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 razor 03.ogg Razor: S—Sorry...
Media:vo eqfh003 8 razor 04.ogg Razor: Wolvendom... many hunters.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 razor 05.ogg Razor: Too noisy, so... I leave...
Media:vo eqfh003 8 razor 06.ogg Razor: *grunts*
Media:vo eqfh003 8 razor 07.ogg Razor: Uh...
Media:vo eqfh003 8 razor 08.ogg Razor: Don't understand words. But feel... warm, tingly...
Media:vo eqfh003 8 razor 09.ogg Razor: Like... Wolfhook thorn...
Media:vo eqfh003 8 razor 10.ogg Razor: Bennett did good poem!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 razor 11.ogg Razor: Yes! Wolfhook... good.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 razor 12.ogg Razor: Yes! But... In future, be careful!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 venti 01.ogg Venti: Aaaand open sesame!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 venti 02.ogg Venti: So, let's hear the story~
Media:vo eqfh003 8 venti 03.ogg Venti: So you came all the way to the Thousand Winds Temple, then what? You were trapped by the mechanism?
(Razor nods)
Media:vo eqfh003 8 venti 04.ogg Venti: Bennett, did you forget about your homework? I'm ready to collect my tuition fee, once I've collected it of course.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 venti 05.ogg Venti: Bennett, may I recite your work?
Media:vo eqfh003 8 venti 06.ogg Venti:
"You and the Mare Jivari
So close and yet so far
One at the edge of the world
The other in the center of my heart
Wolfhook and dandelion
My Windblume offering to you."
Media:vo eqfh003 8 venti 07.ogg Venti: A marvelous work. Unpretentious and honest, sincere and evocative.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 venti 08.ogg Venti: A novel take indeed.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 venti 09.ogg Venti: Everyone, I have an announcement to make.
Media:vo eqfh003 8 venti 10.ogg Venti: All the poems from the fast-track class have now been collected!
Media:vo eqfh003 8 venti 11.ogg Venti: So to celebrate, let's go to the tavern and have a drink!
Media:vo eqfh003 9 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Welcome, have a seat wherever you like.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: Since arriving in Mondstadt, you have offered invaluable support to its people. This is their way of saying thank you.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Passing on messages and deliberating over ceremonial details... Sounds more like your line of work, Kaeya.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: ...Hmph.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: Folks in Mondstadt are on edge with you constantly on prowl. You're no ordinary sister, that's for sure.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: The better the wine, the higher the price... just economics.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 01.ogg Kaeya: Oh! I was about to finish this drink and go looking for you, but you've done the hard part for me.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 02.ogg Kaeya: It is the Windblume Festival after all. No one in Mondstadt who has the time and Mora is going to miss out on a trip to the tavern.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 03.ogg Kaeya: Traveler, will you have a drink?
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 04.ogg Kaeya: Haha, no pressure, it's not a requirement. Soaking up the festival atmosphere is the most important thing.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 05.ogg Kaeya: Master Jean wanted to me to pass along this message... You've been chosen as this year's Windblume Star! Quite the honor.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 06.ogg Kaeya: The Windblume Star is one of Mondstadt's greatest honors, normally only bestowed upon those who have made enormous sacrifices for Mondstadt... or who have truly proven themselves over the Windblume Festival period.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 07.ogg Kaeya: I know you will receive it gracefully. Oh yes — and another thing.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 08.ogg Kaeya: The Windblume Star must attend the Windblume Ceremony together with the Acting Grand Master. During the ceremony, you will represent the people of Mondstadt in making a Windblume offering to the Anemo Archon, Barbatos.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 09.ogg Kaeya: Hah, a good question. Diluc, care to explain?
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 10.ogg Kaeya: *sigh* No sense of humor.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 11.ogg Kaeya: Traveler, the Windblume is always chosen by the Windblume Star. So the flower offered to the Anemo Archon for this year's celebrations... is entirely up to you.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 12.ogg Kaeya: Hahahaha, and who is most directly responsible for creating the demand for an alcohol-delivery service at this time of the year in the first place?
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 13.ogg Kaeya: Why don't we ask the formidable Sister Rosaria... What do you think?
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 14.ogg Kaeya: I'd call it... a misunderstanding. I caught sight of a suspicious figure hurtling by the Knights of Favonius Headquarters. Fortunately, I discovered that it was Miss Rosaria, and stayed my hand.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 15.ogg Kaeya: Haha... My, such a formidable wit, too. But really, is there any here among us today who can't be said to possess a talent or two?
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 16.ogg Kaeya: Even the celebrated Honorary Knight has graced us with their presence tonight. Truly, a good day for a drink.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 17.ogg Kaeya: Please collect the goods from Diluc. Three bottles, as promised. They didn't come cheap.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 kaeya 18.ogg Kaeya: A toast, everyone. To a happy Windblume Festival and the free people of Mondstadt. Cheers!
Media:vo eqfh003 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey Charles! It's us!
Media:vo eqfh003 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh? Master Diluc?
Media:vo eqfh003 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Windblume Star?
Media:vo eqfh003 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: But, which Windblume are you talking about?
Media:vo eqfh003 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Whoa... no pressure, huh?
Media:vo eqfh003 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Formidable...? Did you guys have a fight?
Media:vo eqfh003 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Aha! So the suspicious figure that day was Rosaria all along.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Tone-Deaf Bard, spare a thought for other people! Paimon's looking for good food, not just good drink!
Media:vo eqfh003 9 rosaria 01.ogg Rosaria: If it's Charles you're after, he's out on delivery.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 rosaria 02.ogg Rosaria: ...He's not bad.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 rosaria 03.ogg Rosaria: Allow me to return the compliment, good Master Diluc. You're hardly a run-of-the-mill businessman yourself.
Media:vo eqfh003 9 rosaria 04.ogg Rosaria: How are you enjoying the Windblume Festival, Traveler?
Media:vo eqfh003 9 rosaria 05.ogg Rosaria: That's good to hear.

Media:vo eqfh003 9 venti 02.ogg Venti: Hey, where's is the bartender? How come Master Diluc's mixing the drinks?
Media:vo eqfh003 9 venti 03.ogg Venti: I see... So, what do you make of Master Diluc's mixing ability?
Media:vo eqfh003 9 venti 04.ogg Venti: Well said! So Kaeya, about that tuition fee...
Media:vo eqfh003 9 venti 05.ogg Venti: Hahaha, what a festival. Now, this won't drink itself!
My Windblume offering to you."
One at the edge of the world
So close and yet so far
The flames fail to rise
The other in the center of my heart
