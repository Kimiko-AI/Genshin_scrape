Albedo - Kreideprinz
Albedo is Chief Alchemist and Captain of the Investigation Team of the Knights of Favonius. His groundbreaking achievements in the field of alchemy have earned him a reputation as a genius.
Not one to socialize, the genius researcher is usually seen wearing the same calm, cool expression. Only when he is buried in his research does his more energetic and enthusiastic side seem to emerge.
Soil and chalk... Albedo spends much time alone, pondering profound alchemical conundrums, but there seems to be no end in sight to his research.
 Adding words... one way to make a big name for ourselves.
 Good for you.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 24a 1.ogg Albedo: Thank you, (Traveler).
 I want to learn to paint.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 24b 1.ogg Albedo: And I am only too happy to share my expertise with you, however... practice is the most essential factor.
 It's been a while.
 Quest DescriptionFavonian Goodies has caught the eye of many, and some good-hearted shopkeepers would like to pitch in and help out...
 So it all came from you...
 So you've never participated in a charity sale...
 Sounds good to me.
 That sounds familiar...
 We are extremely grateful.
 We can't take all this and give nothing in return.
 Welcome to our store!
 Yet you've done more for charity than any of us...
Albedo - Kreideprinz
Albedo is Chief Alchemist and Captain of the Investigation Team of the Knights of Favonius. His groundbreaking achievements in the field of alchemy have earned him a reputation as a genius.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Hello there.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: I'm not in dire need of anything right now. I just heard that you were running the Knights of Favonius' stall, and thought I'd come over.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: As it happens, Timaeus and I made some progress in our research recently, so I took the opportunity to bring you a batch of our finished product. Consider it our contribution to the charity effort.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: It's an Extra-Strong Sobriety Potion that can sober up the intoxicated and alleviate hangovers.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: Please hand them out for free to anyone who needs them. Having some complimentary items will undoubtedly help you attract more customers.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: Oh? It must have been a while since I demonstrated my capabilities to you.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: I most likely wouldn't have had any interest in research like this in the past.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: But now I think that it's worthwhile using alchemy to make people's lives easier in small ways like this.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: Alright then, I shan't refuse.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: I had no idea you two had such keen business sense.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: It's a savvy choice of location for selling snacks. There's a festive mood all around, and the division of labor is eminently sensible.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: If any other knight of Favonius were running the show, it would be a much more... generic operation.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 13.ogg Albedo: Well, I provided a dozen or so landscape paintings for a previous charity event, also run by the Knights of Favonius.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 14.ogg Albedo: Well, the people buying them certainly thought so.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 15.ogg Albedo: Some felt that my painting style was a rare one worth investing in, and offered a large sum of money for each work.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 16.ogg Albedo: This, plus the sizable profits made from auctioning some of my still life paintings, seemed to give Alice an idea.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 17.ogg Albedo: She used her personal connections to apply for some sort of certification for my artwork... I believe they call it "copyright"?
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 18.ogg Albedo: Later, many artists began to imitate my landscape paintings, and they became a common sight throughout Mondstadt.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 19.ogg Albedo: According to the rules of the copyright that Alice applied for, the artists need to pay me a portion of their revenue for each landscape painting of this style that they sell.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 20.ogg Albedo: Wealth was never one of my goals. I don't care where the money goes, so I entrusted it to the Knights of Favonius and let them manage it.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 21.ogg Albedo: I suppose it would be fitting to use it to pay for the destruction that Alice has created.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 22.ogg Albedo: But from what I hear, they use it all on charitable initiatives, which is also a noble cause.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 23.ogg Albedo: Though it was hardly my original intention, I have come to embrace my unexpected philanthropic achievements.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 24a 1.ogg Albedo: Thank you, (Traveler).
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 24b 1.ogg Albedo: And I am only too happy to share my expertise with you, however... practice is the most essential factor.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 albedo 25.ogg Albedo: Well then, I will be returning to the workshop. I wish you and the shop all the best.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 bernhard 01.ogg Bernhard: Honorary Knight, Paimon! Good news! We have some new helpers!
Media:vo jyeq003 1 bernhard 02.ogg Bernhard: These two store owners heard about our charity sale. They want to donate their earnings and join us.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 mats 01.ogg Mats: Absolutely!
Media:vo jyeq003 1 mats 02.ogg Mats: Each extra donation means one extra person getting the help they need. Both Pauline and I think that's more important than us making more money than we technically need.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What? A donation? Are you sure?
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yeah! Ahh, this is the warmest, fuzziest feeling ever...
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hmm, but this does mean that we'll have to change the name of our shop! Uhh, how about... Favonian Goodies and Buddies.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Alright, let's give this all we've got and make this a charity event to remember!
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Over here for snacks, fresh flowers, and general goods! Folks, grab bargains at Favonian Goodies and Buddies!
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Huh? Hey, look, it's Albedo!
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Looking to buy anything in particular, Albedo?
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Aw, so you came all the way here just to help us out? That's so nice of you!
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Let's take a look here, we got bottles of... wait, what is this stuff?
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Sounds like a super-useful invention! It must have taken you ages...
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Definitely! Well, Paimon assumes so, 'cause Paimon's never been drunk before... but plenty of our customers probably have been.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: It would definitely ruin the mood if someone fell into the lake or tripped over a rock after having one too many glasses of festive cheer.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Yeah, Albedo, you should take some snacks back with you and share them with Klee. It's on the house!
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Wow, getting complimented by Albedo is an amazing feeling... This must be how it feels to drink an Extra-Strong Sobriety Potion when you wake up with a groggy head!
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Anyway... it sounds like you know quite a lot about running a charity sale yourself, Albedo!
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: They must have been worth a fortune!
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: You never cease to amaze, Albedo...
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Thanks for your contribution, and good luck with your research!
Media:vo jyeq003 1 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: Come again when you're free!
Media:vo jyeq003 1 pauline 01.ogg Pauline: This year's Weinlesefest is busier than previous years, so we met our target earnings more quickly than we expected. That's enough for us.
Media:vo jyeq003 1 pauline 02.ogg Pauline: It doesn't seem right to leave the important task of caring for our most vulnerable to you alone. We just want to help however we can. Please, it's the least we can do.

With two new staff, the scale of the charity sale grows...
You make some snacks for Albedo to take back with him...
