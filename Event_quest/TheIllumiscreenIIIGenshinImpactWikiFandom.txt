 But if I take all the prizes...
 Do you have another image for me?
 I've found every last chest.
 Quest DescriptionBrother Qian from Liyue Adventurers' Guild is still inviting people to try playing the Illumiscreen...
Brother Qian: Ahem. The Guild has prepared an extra-special gift for you on account of you being such an accomplished adventurer.
Brother Qian: All in a day's work for you, huh? I gotta say, you're one heck of an adventurer.
Brother Qian: Alright then, happy Lantern Rite. Have a good one.
Brother Qian: Go take a look at the screens. You'll find all the treasure clues in there.
Brother Qian: Hehe, you'll see what I mean when you give it a try. This time, you're looking for a divine crane.
Brother Qian: How is the treasure hunt going?
Brother Qian: Once you've got the images to align, you can go find the treasure.
Brother Qian: See those chests? Go ahead and open them. The contents are all for you.
Brother Qian: The same principle applies - you combine three images to make one whole. The difficulty is in the fact that they're linked together this time.
Brother Qian: The treasure has all been prepared specially by the Guild. Happy hunting.
Brother Qian: This time, try and make a crane.
Brother Qian: Try the Illumiscreen...
Brother Qian: Wow, you managed to decipher all three images... That's impressive...
Brother Qian: Wow. You, um, did it.
Brother Qian: Yep, there'll be squat left for anyone else. That's adventuring for you! Finders keepers.
Brother Qian: You bet! And since you solved both the previous ones so easily, I've swapped the lanterns for the most difficult ones available.
Paimon: Hmm, let's have a careful look around.
Paimon: It feels like this should be the place...
Paimon: Still, where are the clues to the treasure?
Paimon: This picture looks like... a crane.
