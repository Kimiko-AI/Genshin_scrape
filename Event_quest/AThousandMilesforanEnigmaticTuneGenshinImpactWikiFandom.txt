Xinyan – Blazing Riff
Xinyan, a rock musician based in Liyue, uses her music as a form of resistance against societal stereotypes.
Her tunes are well-loved, and the style of her tunes is much like she is: straightforward, generous, confident, and proud.
Every time she steps onto her personally-designed stage, loyal fans will come flocking and start to rock to her rhythm.
If you hear cheers and fireworks go up at any place in Liyue Harbor at the same time, it's most likely Xinyan, so don't miss out!

Yelan - Valley Orchid
As a special intelligence officer who works under Ningguang, Yelan comes and goes like a shadow.
Even the ruling Qixing with their vast powers must find some dark corners hard to reach.
This is where Yelan comes in, with her task being to clean these corners up by dint of her exceptional capabilities as an intelligence agent.
A word to the wise: do not try to lie to her, for falsehoods may last as long as fragile bubbles before her meticulous thoughts.
 A Lantern Rite music festival would be a huge hit.
 A Lantern Rite music festival would be something different.
 Absolutely.
 At its heart is a true story.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 30b 1.ogg Dvorak: Exactly. It may just be a legend to others, but for me, it's a real part of my family history.
 But we will end the night on a high note.
 Doesn't ring a bell.
 Don't listen to Paimon...
 Everything has been going great.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 03a 1.ogg Zhongli: I sense you are older and wiser than the last time we met. It seems your travels continue to yield valuable insights.
 Thank you, Zhongli.
 Greetings, Madame Ping.
 Greetings.
 I remember.
 I understand.
 I'm already drooling...
 I'm quite curious myself.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 paimon 06b 1.ogg Paimon: Right? How could anyone not be!
 I'm sure the wind that guided you here feels the same way.
 I've never had anything like it...
 If we could add some musical elements to Lantern Rite...
 If we could organize a Lantern Rite music festival...
 If we use Elemental Sight...
 It comes down to the ill will of the user...
 It must have something to do with that melody...
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 08b 1.ogg Yelan: Your instincts are pretty good.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 08b 2.ogg Yelan: Hmm, or perhaps it's not instinct. The strange melody is one of the few pieces of information you have available, after all.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 08b 3.ogg Yelan: Let me share a folk story with you.
 It's a nice legend.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 30a 1.ogg Dvorak: Well, yes, as it stands now, it's become a touch too romantic and detached from reality... But I understand the original story and its historical grounding better than anyone else.
 It's been too long, I can't seem to recall...
 It's definitely possible.
 It's difficult to theorize with so little evidence.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 08a 1.ogg Yelan: Yup. It's not obvious at first sight, that's for sure.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 08a 2.ogg Yelan: To be honest, I was only able to put it all together because of some background knowledge about this area.
 Keqing strikes again...
 Know anything about the strange music?
 Let us handle this one.
 Let's head off.
 More!? You already had the Sumpter Beast's share...
 Of course.
 Paimon, you're running your mouth again...
 Paimon, you're trying to freeload again.
 Quest DescriptionYou return to Liyue with Paimon in anticipation of yet another unforgettable time at the Lantern Rite Festival...
 Ready to go when you are!
 So we're not stealing anyone's thunder...
 So you already know each other...
 Sure.
 Thank you, Zhongli.
 That does sound like a good idea.
 That settles it then. It was Liyue.
 That sounds somewhat familiar.
 That was quick...
 Their bad deeds influenced the emotions associated with the music.
 Then let's get moving.
 Things have been going... alright.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 03b 1.ogg Zhongli: Setbacks are inevitable over the course of a long journey. If you wish to share what's troubling you, allow me to lend my ear. There is no need to shoulder all burdens by yourself.
 Thank you, Zhongli.
 Unbelievably efficient...
 We could follow their tracks...
 We don't have enough information yet.
 We will check in with you later at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
 Well done, Yelan!
 What about that fairy lady?
 What about your ancestor?
 Why's it a shame?
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 paimon 06a 1.ogg Paimon: 'Cause Paimon's curious, that's why! It's like when you have a tune stuck in your head, but you don't even know what it is. It's driving Paimon crazy!
A short and slender figure rescues the drowning man, and brings him back to shore...
A word to the wise: do not try to lie to her, for falsehoods may last as long as fragile bubbles before her meticulous thoughts.
After a short wait, Keqing and Ganyu arrive at the square in front of Yujing Terrace...
As a special intelligence officer who works under Ningguang, Yelan comes and goes like a shadow.
Baiwen hurries off...
Dvorak: *grumble*
Even the ruling Qixing with their vast powers must find some dark corners hard to reach.
Every time she steps onto her personally-designed stage, loyal fans will come flocking and start to rock to her rhythm.
Everyone savors some Delicious Lotus Flower Crisps as they enjoy the scenery...
Her tunes are well-loved, and the style of her tunes is much like she is: straightforward, generous, confident, and proud.
If you hear cheers and fireworks go up at any place in Liyue Harbor at the same time, it's most likely Xinyan, so don't miss out!
Media:vo dialog eqhdj201 dvorak 01.ogg Dvorak: That lady I just talked to, Ganyu... she really thinks of everything.
Media:vo dialog eqhdj201 dvorak 02.ogg Dvorak: It got me wondering... could it be that all our failed attempts so far have been down to our failure to properly prepare for different contingencies?
Media:vo dialog eqhdj201 dvorak 03.ogg Dvorak: Many thanks, Keqing.
Media:vo dialog eqhdj201 dvorak 04.ogg Dvorak: Heh... You know, I once heard someone from Liyue describe a person as "swift as lightning and agile as the wind." At the time, I thought it was a curious expression, and I had a hard time piecing together a mental image of such a person.
Media:vo dialog eqhdj201 dvorak 05.ogg Dvorak: But now, having seen Keqing in action, I honestly can't think of any other way to describe it... It's such a vivid and expressive phrase. A testament to the richness of Liyue's culture.
Media:vo dialog eqhdj201 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: ...She said she'll reach out to the Yun-Han Opera Troupe? I see.
Media:vo dialog eqhdj201 keqing 02.ogg Keqing: Then I'll arrange for a rehearsal venue and accommodation as soon as possible. Everything should be ready tonight.
Media:vo dialog eqhdj201 keqing 03.ogg Keqing: You're too kind, Mr. Dvorak.
Media:vo dialog eqhdj201 madameping 01.ogg Madame Ping: You mustn't be afraid to try new things. If you never try, you'll never know.
Media:vo dialog eqhdj201 madameping 02.ogg Madame Ping: With your contribution, I'm sure this year's Lantern Rite will be a most spectacular one.
Media:vo dialog eqhdj201 zhongli 01.ogg Zhongli: As for Director Hu's list... Hmm...
Media:vo dialog eqhdj201 zhongli 02.ogg Zhongli: I shall attend to it after one last round of tea.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Time flies so fast! Before you know it, Lantern Rite's almost here again.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: The people of Liyue must've already started preparing for their most important festival of the year, right? Hopefully, Paimon will be able to check out tons of great food again this year!
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Anyway, let's go to Liyue Harbor and see what's up!
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Paimon votes we go say hi to Xiangling first...
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Eh? Zhongli! What a pleasant surprise meeting you here!
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: So Zhongli, are you here to listen to stories over tea again?
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: However...?
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Huh? "Nascent" Bamboo Shoots...? Why can't you just use normal Bamboo Shoots instead?
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Wait, Paimon knows! Because Zhongli prefers the finer things in life, right?
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Okay, Mr. Particular, lemme guess... The "nascent" Bamboo Shoot has a uniquely tender texture and a delicate, sweet taste that its "normal" cousin cannot match.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Uh, well, we were planning to use the opportunity to say hi to some of our friends! But before we were able to figure out a schedule, we ran into you.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Ugh! You're doing this on purpose, aren't you!? Paimon's onto your plan — you just wanna hoodwink us into fetching your bamboo for you!
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: You... Ugh, let's go, (Traveler)! Paimon's tastebuds can't take it anymore!
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Collecting a few Bamboo Shoots shouldn't take too long. Paimon has got to get her hands on some of that soup!
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: See, see! Paimon knew he was just bamboozling us!
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: We're heading out! Enjoy your walk, Zhongli.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 01.ogg Zhongli: Oh? Why, the pleasure is all mine... as is the surprise, surely.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 02.ogg Zhongli: It must be fate that brings us together in this place. How have you fared as of late?
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 03a 1.ogg Zhongli: I sense you are older and wiser than the last time we met. It seems your travels continue to yield valuable insights.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 03b 1.ogg Zhongli: Setbacks are inevitable over the course of a long journey. If you wish to share what's troubling you, allow me to lend my ear. There is no need to shoulder all burdens by yourself.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 04.ogg Zhongli: You are too kind.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 05.ogg Zhongli: I had originally planned to set out after this last round of tea. However...
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 06.ogg Zhongli: I had planned to take a walk to Qingce Village and gather some nascent Bamboo Shoots, which are currently in season. A villager there once gave me a small sample, and they possessed a most excellent flavor.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 07.ogg Zhongli: An astute observation, Paimon. You know me well indeed.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 08.ogg Zhongli: Lantern Rite is almost upon us, but besides the Bamboo Shoots, there are a few other items I have not yet procured from Director Hu's list... May I ask if you have already made arrangements for the days ahead?
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 09.ogg Zhongli: Well then, might I invite you to imagine the sheer delight that is a soup cooked with the freshest nascent Bamboo Shoots in all the land? Generous cuts of pork belly and crisp, fragrant Bamboo Shoots, placed together in the pot, and left to simmer slowly for half a day...
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 10.ogg Zhongli: Hmm? Why, I assure you, I would do no such thing. I merely wished to inform you of the freshest, most succulent and flavorful Bamboo Shoots one could ever hope to taste.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 11.ogg Zhongli: Such fine specimens are indeed well worth the excursion. Very well, I shall leave the Bamboo Shoots to you. Should you have the good fortune to find some, please share them with me as well.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 12.ogg Zhongli: However, there is no need to rush.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 13.ogg Zhongli: The streets of Liyue will be bustling with visitors and filled with all manner of celebrations during the festive period. By all means, go wherever your interests lead you.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 14.ogg Zhongli: The nascent Bamboo Shoots would be but a wonderful final touch to a most exceptional feast. What an honor it would be to savor them in the company of friends.
Media:vo eqhdj201 1 zhongli 15.ogg Zhongli: Take care now, you two.
Media:vo eqhdj201 10 fujing 01.ogg Fujing: Hey! Who are you? Where'd you come from?
Media:vo eqhdj201 10 fujing 02.ogg Fujing: You kidding me!? You think I'm scared of you?
Media:vo eqhdj201 10 fujing 03.ogg Fujing: Curses... seems like you're not all talk after all...
Media:vo eqhdj201 10 fujing 04.ogg Fujing: But there's no going back now... Better up my game!
Media:vo eqhdj201 10 yelan 01.ogg Yelan: Hmm... the evidence is conclusive.
Media:vo eqhdj201 10 yelan 02.ogg Yelan: Okay — confess, and we'll go easy on you. My patience is running low, so why don't you do us both a favor, hmm?
Media:vo eqhdj201 10 yelan 03.ogg Yelan: Perhaps not. But you should be.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 fujing 01.ogg Fujing: Mercy, have mercy...
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 fujing 02.ogg Fujing: I surrender! I surrender, please! I'll do whatever you say! Please have mercy...
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 fujing 03.ogg Fujing: I won't! I swear!
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 fujing 04.ogg Fujing: Um, y'know, so... Lantern Rite's nearly here, and like a lot of people, I wanted to buy a few nice things...
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 fujing 05.ogg Fujing: I know I'm with the Treasure Hoarders and everything, but I don't really have any kind of experience with robbing people and whatnot, so I, uh... I don't have the guts to break into somebody's house.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 fujing 06.ogg Fujing: No, not at all. I'm just... telling it how it is.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 fujing 07.ogg Fujing: I racked my brains trying to think of what I could do, and eventually I remembered something from back when I was a kid. The bandits would blow their horn, and my grandma would grab us kids and run...
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 fujing 08.ogg Fujing: I remember the tune, so I... I figured I'd try it for myself. ...I mean, just to see what would happen! At first, anyway... I seriously didn't expect that family to pack up and leave...
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 fujing 09.ogg Fujing: But they did, and they just left all their stuff right there for the taking. It was too easy, I just... I couldn't resist...
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 fujing 10.ogg Fujing: It was completely wrong of me, I know that now. I'll return everything that I took — it's all still in perfect condition. It'll be like it was never gone... Please, gimme a chance, huh? Let me make it right...
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 fujing 11.ogg Fujing: Y—Yes, um... yes...
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 fujing 12.ogg Fujing: Yes, Ma'am!
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 fujing 13.ogg Fujing: You mean...
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow, you're really going to complain to us about that?
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What is it? Is there something else?
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yelan's such a pro at this. With her taking it from here, it's as good as resolved.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Fwoosh! Random Event: "A Strange Melody" complete!
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Although... it's kind of a shame that we never got that Treasure Hoarder guy to play the melody again.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 paimon 06a 1.ogg Paimon: 'Cause Paimon's curious, that's why! It's like when you have a tune stuck in your head, but you don't even know what it is. It's driving Paimon crazy!
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 paimon 06b 1.ogg Paimon: Right? How could anyone not be!
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: When we were chatting with Mr. Dvorak, music seemed like such a positive thing.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: And most music is, right? It can help us relax, feel all warm and fuzzy, recall happy memories, or even just think happy thoughts...
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Paimon never imagined that music could be used to commit crimes...
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Oh, really? Huh... Makes sense... Paimon's musical understanding improves again!
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Well anyway, now that everything's resolved, let's get back to Liyue Harbor. Baiwen's still waiting for us with our Random Event rewards!
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 01.ogg Yelan: Ooh, it's a little late for that... I've come this far, I might as well finish the job.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 02.ogg Yelan: Hmph. Tell us everything.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 03.ogg Yelan: You have one chance, and I'm warning you: Don't make me ask twice...
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 04.ogg Yelan: Mkay. Continue.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 05.ogg Yelan: Give you a chance, huh? Sounds to me like you'd rather strike some kind of a deal... than spend Lantern Rite behind bars?
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 06.ogg Yelan: You know how to bargain, I'll give you that. It's just a pity that you didn't confess at the first opportunity.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 07.ogg Yelan: You'll have to take a walk with me.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 08.ogg Yelan: Once we've returned the goods, we'll find the owner of the house, and you can apologize to them in person. After that, I'll escort you to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 09.ogg Yelan: You know, as a former victim of this kind of crime yourself, I doubt anyone understands the fear you inflicted quite as well as you do.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 10.ogg Yelan: Does your greed matter more to you than your fear? More to the point, if you can play a tune from memory, don't you think you should be capable of making an honest living?
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 11.ogg Yelan: Heh, that's enough hints for you. You'll have plenty of time to reflect on all of this yourself.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 12.ogg Yelan: There's not much left to wrap up, so I'll take it from here. Guess this is where I'll say goodbye.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 13.ogg Yelan: ...Hmm...
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 14.ogg Yelan: I'm still not sure how you first got your hands on this information, so play it safe when you get back. Don't mention to anyone that you ran into me out here.
(Yelan whispers to the Traveler)
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 15.ogg Yelan: You helped a lot with the investigation and arrest anyway, so it's perfectly fair for you to get all the credit. Just take it — it works better for me too.
Media:vo eqhdj201 11 yelan 16.ogg Yelan: See you when I see you. And Happy Lantern Rite.
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 baiwen 01.ogg Baiwen: That's great news! Please wait here a moment, if you would be so kind. Lady Ningguang instructed me to advise her upon your return...
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 ningguang 01.ogg Ningguang: My greetings to the both of you. Long time no see.
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 ningguang 02.ogg Ningguang: On the contrary, I think it is those that I have known longest to whom I should extend the greatest courtesies.
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 ningguang 03.ogg Ningguang: Alas, on a different day, I would invite both of you inside for some tea, and a brief respite from your travels...
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 ningguang 04.ogg Ningguang: But you're quite right: Trivial matters aside, there's no escaping the fact that we have a grand concert to organize.
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 ningguang 05.ogg Ningguang: Once the performance itself is over, we'll then need to invite the representatives of the Iridescence Tour for a discussion on future collaboration opportunities. The financing arrangements alone could well entail many rounds of discussion.
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 ningguang 06.ogg Ningguang: Simply put, there will always be work to do.
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 ningguang 07.ogg Ningguang: Hehe... well, we can discuss more current affairs if you'd prefer.
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 ningguang 08.ogg Ningguang: I trust you saw this year's Mingxiao Lantern at the docks when you arrived at the city?
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 ningguang 09.ogg Ningguang: Sea Gazer. I believe you're familiar with the name?
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 ningguang 10.ogg Ningguang: Legend holds that he was free-spirited and easy-going. People described him as a cheerful soul and a loyal friend.
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 ningguang 11.ogg Ningguang: "On this marvelous Lantern Rite, we pray that the fallen heroes may be guided home."
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 ningguang 12.ogg Ningguang: If the sound of music can flow like the rivers and streams into every corner of the land, perhaps the souls of those who have gone before us will hear the song of a new era. I wonder whether the melodies will be to their liking...
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 ningguang 13.ogg Ningguang: Hehe, well let's hope so.
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 ningguang 14.ogg Ningguang: I heard that you'll be going on a search with Ganyu to find the descendants of a fairy lady from a Fontaine legend.
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 ningguang 15.ogg Ningguang: I'm sure this quest to uncover the truth behind an ancient story will turn into a most charming tale... Do share it with me, won't you? I couldn't bear to miss out.
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Baiwen~! We're back. Everything's all sorted!
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: No need to be so formal with us, Ningguang! We've known each other for a long time now. You must be super busy with all the preparations for Lantern Rite. Don't mind us!
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Whoa... you're already thinking that far ahead?
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Yeah! It looked like... a goose? Which adeptus is it modeled on this time?
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh, they're gonna love them! Paimon's sure of it!
Media:vo eqhdj201 12 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: At least, if the guy you mentioned is anything to go by, the adepti and heroes of the past sound like a positive and free-spirited cheerful bunch. They're sure to be open to new music!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 01.ogg ???: Help! Heeeelp!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 02.ogg ???: *cough* *cough*...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 03.ogg ???: Phew... I—I think I'm okay now. Thank you so much...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 04.ogg Dvorak: I'm Dvorak, a musician from Fontaine.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 05.ogg Dvorak: I came through Stone Gate, intending to head towards Liyue Harbor, but then I became captivated by the beautiful scenery... and before long, I was completely lost.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 06.ogg Dvorak: Just now, I was so mesmerized by the waterfall that I slipped and fell into the water. If it weren't for Miss Yaoyao's help, I shudder to think what might have happened...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 07.ogg Dvorak: Yes Ma'am, I understand... I'll remember to be more careful next time.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 09.ogg Dvorak: Oh, uh... I'll be fine, heh...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 10.ogg Dvorak: No no, they're perfect.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 11.ogg Dvorak: When I was traveling through Mondstadt, I had a chance to try one of their Moon Pies. It had a meat filling, unlike these crisps. But apart from that, it seems like they follow a similar cooking process. Both are delicious in their own way.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 12.ogg Dvorak: As for Fontaine's cooking, though... Ah, it's been a long time since I've had a taste of home.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 13.ogg Dvorak: I do. It's part of my job — I'm one of the main organizers of the Iridescence Tour.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 14.ogg Dvorak: The Iridescence Tour is one of the biggest music festivals in Fontaine. We're looking to expand, though. Our aim is to hold a festival in every nation.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 15.ogg Dvorak: At least, all the main organizers share this goal. Unfortunately...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 16.ogg Dvorak: *sigh* It's a long story, so I'll spare you the details. But anyway, so the main reason I'm traveling all around Teyvat is to promote our music festivals. But I have some... personal reasons, too.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 17.ogg Dvorak: Let me see... well, to explain it in full, I'd have to start with a story from my ancestors... I don't want to take up too much of your time?
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 18.ogg Dvorak: Okay. Then I'll start from the beginning.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 19.ogg Dvorak: The story goes that my ancestor, who was also a traveler, once slipped and fell into a lake during his travels. As he was sinking and gasping for breath, he heard a wondrous tune in the air...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 20.ogg Dvorak: They say it was the most beautiful, moving melody he had ever heard.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 21.ogg Dvorak: Even in that life-and-death moment, the ethereal music seized his full attention, and almost made him forget the fact that he was drowning...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 22.ogg Dvorak: When he finally came to, he found that he had already been brought ashore. Not too far from him stood an unfamiliar woman with an almost divine aura.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 23.ogg Dvorak: Once she saw that he was no longer in danger, she left without a word.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 24.ogg Dvorak: My ancestor tried to run after her to give his thanks. But although a mere dozen paces separated them, no matter how quickly he gave chase, he drew no closer, and remained a dozen paces behind.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 25.ogg Dvorak: In the end, all he could do was to bow in thanks to the woman as he watched her walk away towards the rivers and mountains in the distance, before at last he turned around and made his way home.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 26.ogg Dvorak: Once he returned to Fontaine, he began to learn an instrument, so that he could spread his story far and wide, just like the bards.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 27.ogg Dvorak: After generations of retelling, embellishing, and dramatizing, people have come to think of that lady as something like a fairy.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 28.ogg Dvorak: The story's become something of a local legend in Fontaine. It's called, "The Lady Overlooking the Lake."
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 29.ogg Dvorak: People now say that if you go down to the lakeside and play an instrument, so long as you play a pleasing melody, you will hear a fairy lady, who is hiding out of sight, playing along with you...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 30a 1.ogg Dvorak: Well, yes, as it stands now, it's become a touch too romantic and detached from reality... But I understand the original story and its historical grounding better than anyone else.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 30b 1.ogg Dvorak: Exactly. It may just be a legend to others, but for me, it's a real part of my family history.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 31.ogg Dvorak: I wanted to find out the truth of this tale. So I decided to retrace my ancestor's steps, and search for that lady's modern-day descendants.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 32.ogg Dvorak: Of course, there's no way of knowing where my ancestor fell into the lake all those years ago. So I always knew that the search would be akin to looking for a needle in a haystack.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 33.ogg Dvorak: I've spent many years on the road now, and I'm nowhere near as fit as I was in my youth. The wish that I have spent half my life chasing after has now become something of an obsession...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 34.ogg Dvorak: Hahaha... There's no need to feel sorry for me. I have made some progress over the years. For example... I've concluded that the story must have taken place in Liyue.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 35.ogg Dvorak: Yes. In fact, that's an intriguing story in and of itself.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 36.ogg Dvorak: I'd always known that Mondstadt is the City of Song and Freedom. But more recently, I heard that the Anemo Archon returned to Mondstadt for a festival in the Fall, and learned that he himself is a patron deity of music.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 37.ogg Dvorak: So, I prayed for the Anemo Archon's guidance in the Mondstadt Cathedral... and as soon as I set foot back outside the front gate, I noticed a cluster of leaves being blown in the wind, further and further west, towards Stone Gate.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 38.ogg Dvorak: A friendly local told me that this meant the wind was guiding me in the direction of Liyue. So, I followed their advice, and made my way here.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 39.ogg Dvorak: Right? You get it! I knew I'd find someone that agrees with me eventually.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 40.ogg Dvorak: Actually, to express my gratitude, I did spend rather a lot of Mora on several bottles of fine wine, which I left at the Statues of the Seven along the way...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 41.ogg Dvorak: But you've already helped me so much...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 dvorak 42.ogg Dvorak: Alright. Well, my sincere thanks to you all. I will never forget your kindness.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Bamboo Shoot... Bamboo Shoot... "Nascent" Bamboo Shoot...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh! This one's only just sprouted, and it looks super fresh. Paimon thinks this is the one!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: These should be enough. Let's head back...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Did you hear that? Someone's calling for help... It's coming from over there!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: That was scary... Well, at least you're alright! All thanks to your savior here... oh, a little girl?
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Whoa, she's so well-mannered!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: My name's Paimon, and this is (Traveler).
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Aww... what a thoughtful kid! She even has some for Paimon!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Mmm, so tasty... If only there were more...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Hope you're taking notes, Traveler. This is how you treat your Paimon!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Sounds like you spend a lot of time on the road, huh?
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Iridescence Tour?
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Well, what are they? Just tell us already!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Mm-hmm, we want to hear it too!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Paimon too...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: It's like... imagine if you'd saved the center of a Lotus Flower Crisp — which is the best part, by the way — 'cause you wanted to eat it another day, but then suddenly, sploosh! It falls into the water, never to be seen again!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Paimon would definitely remember that for the rest of her life!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Ooh! So you finally found a lead?
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: Don't worry, Yaoyao! We, uh... we have a lot of experience with deciphering omens and stuff.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: And anyway, you only got scammed if you handed over Mora, right?
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 21.ogg Paimon: Oh dear...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 22.ogg Paimon: You know what, it's been a minute since we saw Ganyu, too. It'd sure be nice to pay her a visit before Lantern Rite.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 paimon 23.ogg Paimon: Uh-oh, Paimon's out of a job... Eh, oh well! Paimon'll just be a cheerleader instead!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 01.ogg ???: ...Are you okay? Did any water go down the wrong pipe?
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 02a.ogg Yaoyao: Greetings, everyone. My name is Yaoyao. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 03.ogg Yaoyao: It's alright, Mr. Dvorak.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 04.ogg Yaoyao: The splashing around the bottom of the waterfall means the stone path is always wet and slippy. You definitely have to be careful.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 05.ogg Yaoyao: Next time you're exploring an unfamiliar environment, try to focus on what's right in front of you. Don't let your mind wander.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 06.ogg Yaoyao: As long as you watch your step, accidents like this won't happen anymore!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 07.ogg Yaoyao: Oh... Are you hungry, Sir?
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 08.ogg Yaoyao: Please, Sir, it's quite alright! I was born and raised here in Liyue. It's only natural for me to extend my hospitality to any guests who are passing through.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 09.ogg Yaoyao: I expect you still have quite a long journey ahead of you? It's very important to keep your energy levels up.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 10a.ogg Yaoyao: I still have some Lotus Flower Crisps left in my backpack. Why don't we split them between the four of us?
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 11.ogg Yaoyao: Hehe, you're welcome!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 12.ogg Yaoyao: Having a healthy appetite is a good thing! It means Paimon's still growing. If I'd known I was gonna run into you, I would have made a second batch.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 13.ogg Yaoyao: What do you think, Sir? Are Liyue's snacks to your taste? I wonder if they're not sweet enough?
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 14.ogg Yaoyao: I love listening to stories!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 15.ogg Yaoyao: Wowwwww!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 16.ogg Yaoyao: I haven't lived half of my life yet, but still... I understand how you must feel.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 17.ogg Yaoyao: Hmm... are you sure? It sounds a bit too much like one of those fake legends told by those treasure hoarder guys to scam gullible grannies from Qingce Village...
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 18.ogg Yaoyao: "Rex Lapis has returned to the world! Just give me some incense and a little Mora towards the travel fees, and I will pass your gift on to the Lord of Geo, and ask him to keep you and your family safe and well..." And so on, and so on.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 19a.ogg Yaoyao: Well, how about this, ladies and gentlemen — why don't I bring you all to Yujing Terrace to see Miss Ganyu?
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 20.ogg Yaoyao: I don't know very many people, so I can't help you out much, but Miss Ganyu and the Qixing know just about everything.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 21.ogg Yaoyao: If you've been scammed, they'll help you get your Mora back. And if the wind was telling the truth, and you wanna keep looking for that lady's family, they'll be the best people to ask.
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 22.ogg Yaoyao: I was gonna take some new medicinal herbs and plants I picked to Miss Ganyu anyway, so it's no trouble at all!
Media:vo eqhdj201 2 yaoyao 23.ogg Yaoyao: Okay, everyone, please follow me! I'll be your guide. Remember to watch where you're going, okay?
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 01.ogg Dvorak: Wow, Liyue Harbor looks very different from when I came last...
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 02.ogg Dvorak: It's almost as if... I'm listening to the same melody, but with a richer timbre, and new variations added...
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 03.ogg Dvorak: Great. Let's go and check it out.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 04.ogg Dvorak: I can't wait to get into the city and see it all up close for myself.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 05.ogg Dvorak: The streets are breathtaking...
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 06.ogg Dvorak: Smiles and laughter everywhere I look... it's contagious.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 07.ogg Dvorak: I can almost feel the music in the air... I have the urge to start waving my conductor's baton...
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 08.ogg Dvorak: Haha... When I was last here to advertise a Liyue stop for the Iridescence Tour, Xinyan was one of the few people willing to give me the time of day.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 09.ogg Dvorak: *sigh* I am so sorry, Xinyan. We've had a string of terrible luck recently, and every time we've tried to put on a show, something or other has come up to stop our plans from materializing...
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 10.ogg Dvorak: No, uh... I'm actually here on personal business this time.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 11.ogg Dvorak: I mean... That's not just up to me.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 12.ogg Dvorak: Hosting a music festival takes a lot of funding and personnel. Moreover, I've never worked with the Liyue authorities before. Even if I were to start putting something together right now... I think it'd be too rushed.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 13.ogg Dvorak: You mean... What?
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 14.ogg Dvorak: Hmm...
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 15.ogg Dvorak: Hmm... Okay. I'll give it a shot.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 dvorak 16.ogg Dvorak: But the opening act is not something to be chosen lightly, Xinyan. I will judge your work by the strictest of standards, so please make sure you are fully prepared.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Well, we are here during Lantern Rite, after all! It only comes once a year, so they always have a big celebration.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: It's fair to say that this time of year is when Liyue Harbor looks the prettiest!
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: A Lantern Rite music festival? Yes please!
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wait, but we're going to meet the Liyue Qixing, aren't we? And they're the ones in charge.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: But what about you, Xinyan? Are you just going to sit this one out?
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Wow, there's that rock 'n' roll spirit, hehe.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: You've got this, Xinyan!
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 01.ogg Xinyan: Hey, everyone! Fancy meeting you all here! What a nice surprise.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 02.ogg Xinyan: (Traveler), Paimon, and Mr. Dvorak, right? Hehe, I've known them all for quite a while.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 03.ogg Xinyan: Feels like I've been chasing this Iridescence Tour bandwagon halfway around the world, but I keep getting stood up. What's going on, Mr. Dvorak?
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 04.ogg Xinyan: Is that right... Hmm, I guess it can't be helped.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 05.ogg Xinyan: So what brings you to Liyue Harbor at this time of the year, anyway? Thinking of putting on a music festival during the Lantern Rite celebrations?
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 06.ogg Xinyan: Aw, so no Lantern Rite music festival?
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 07.ogg Xinyan: Hahaha, this is the perfect opportunity! Sure, it might not work out, but it can't hurt to bring it up as a suggestion.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 08.ogg Xinyan: That's the spirit! See, even (Traveler) agrees with me. Mr. Dvorak, don't let yourself be put off by the fact that a few things haven't worked out recently.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 09.ogg Xinyan: As for the performers... I can put you in touch with some local artists.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 10.ogg Xinyan: My friend Yun Jin is a well-known opera singer in Liyue. With her support and a commissioned song from the Yun-Han Opera Troupe, we should be able to get something going.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 11.ogg Xinyan: Haha, what do you take me for?
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 12.ogg Xinyan: If we actually manage to make the Iridescence Tour: Lantern Rite Grand Concert a reality, you think I'd let anyone else perform the opening act!?
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 13.ogg Xinyan: What do ya say, Mr. Dvorak?
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 14.ogg Xinyan: Are you kidding? I thought you'd never ask!
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 15.ogg Xinyan: Whew, guess my shopping time's getting cut short! I'm gonna head back right away and start working on this!
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 xinyan 16.ogg Xinyan: Yaoyao, if you run into your senior on your way to the Qixing, please send her my regards!
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 yaoyao 01.ogg Yaoyao: Hee-hee... I'm glad that you're enjoying the city!
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 yaoyao 02.ogg Yaoyao: Hello, Xinyan! Let me introduce some new friends. They are...
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 yaoyao 03.ogg Yaoyao: Uh-huh, that's right! Miss Keqing and Miss Ningguang can make anything happen.
Media:vo eqhdj201 3 yaoyao 04.ogg Yaoyao: Okay, I promise I will! Good luck with your music, Xinyan.
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 dvorak 01.ogg Dvorak: Hello, Ma'am. I am a musician from Fontaine, and an organizer of the Iridescence Tour... I don't suppose you've heard of it...
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 dvorak 02.ogg Dvorak: Hear, hear! I do believe that, my own dear grandmother aside, you are the wisest old lady I've ever met.
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 madameping 01.ogg Madame Ping: Oh, calm down now, dear, I'm not about to run off anywhere. I'm not a bundle of energy like you...
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 madameping 02.ogg Madame Ping: Aww, bless you, Yaoyao... you do say the sweetest things.
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 madameping 03.ogg Madame Ping: Ah, look who it is. Visiting friends during the Lantern Rite, are we?
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 madameping 04.ogg Madame Ping: Hehe... An old lady like me wouldn't know much about that sort of thing. A music festival, you say? It sounds terribly exciting.
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 madameping 05.ogg Madame Ping: Why, not at all. Music pays homage to history and culture, and it can also be a bridge between different civilizations.
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 madameping 06.ogg Madame Ping: Times change, and the music enjoyed by the youngsters of today is, no doubt, very different from the tunes I was accustomed to in my youth. Nevertheless, all fine things in life can be appreciated.
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 madameping 07.ogg Madame Ping: And so... I look forward to it immensely.
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 madameping 08.ogg Madame Ping: Goodness gracious, you're all being suspiciously sweet today. Yaoyao, whatever have you been feeding them?
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 madameping 09.ogg Madame Ping: Hehe. Well, I'm sure you must have plenty to be getting on with, yes? Run along now, don't let me hold you up.
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So, about this "senior" of yours Xinyan mentioned just now... is that anyone we know?
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: You're half right, Madame Ping! We were also trying to help out Mr. Dvorak over here. We were on our way to take him to see the Qixing.
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh right! Madame Ping, how would you feel about that?
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: You're an elder of Liyue, and you know all about Liyue's cultural traditions. Hearing your thoughts would definitely help us figure out how best to approach it!
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: For example... do you think it might be a bit too modern, or is there any other issue?
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Thanks, Madame Ping! We'll see you again soon!
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 yaoyao 01.ogg Yaoyao: Yes, it's Xiangling. She's mentioned you two before.
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 yaoyao 02.ogg Yaoyao: Xiangling's always thinking about cooking... Whenever she gets scrapes or burns, she just leaves them to heal by themselves. She definitely needs someone around her to look after her.
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 yaoyao 03.ogg Yaoyao: I know you must have looked out for her a lot too in the time you've known her. So thank you for that.
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 yaoyao 04.ogg Yaoyao: Oh! It's Master. Is it okay if I go and say hi to her?
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 yaoyao 05.ogg Yaoyao: I haven't seen you in days, Master! I've missed you.
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 yaoyao 06.ogg Yaoyao: Master, Master, the Iridescence Tour is a super famous music festival!
Media:vo eqhdj201 4 yaoyao 07.ogg Yaoyao: Master, you're in such a great mood today! You're even cracking jokes with the rest of us.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 baixiao 01.ogg Baixiao: Understood, Miss Ganyu. I'll take my leave now.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 01.ogg Dvorak: *sigh* All very valid points. I completely understand...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 02.ogg Dvorak: Oh, yes, certainly... Let's step to the side and discuss further.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 03.ogg Dvorak: No, this is excellent! I'm racking my brains, but I don't think you've missed a single thing.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 04.ogg Dvorak: Thank you, Yaoyao. Happy Lantern Rite to you, too.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 05.ogg Dvorak: Thank you so much, Keqing!
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 06.ogg Dvorak: I had become quite discouraged after our recent failures, and was expecting the same outcome once again, so I didn't dare to get my hopes up...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 07.ogg Dvorak: ...Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined this going so smoothly. It's like a dream come true...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 08.ogg Dvorak: Right... Time for me to call in the performers. To stage a concert at a high-profile event like this is a rare opportunity. We'll make sure it's a night to remember!
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 09.ogg Dvorak: Yes indeed. I know exactly what I'm doing from here.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 10.ogg Dvorak: For a musician, music will always be the language they are most fluent in.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 11.ogg Dvorak: Oh, that... that can wait for another time.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 12.ogg Dvorak: Oh, that's quite alright. I don't even know what the person I'm trying to find looks like, so it was always going to be a long shot...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 13.ogg Dvorak: Don't worry about me, Ganyu. Your time and energy are needed elsewhere. I'm sure you already have plenty to deal with between this concert and everything else going on during the Lantern Rite.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 14.ogg Dvorak: Did you say the adepti? And you're — illuminated beast? Part-qilin?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 15.ogg Dvorak: Are you telling me... all the rumors of the Liyue adepti are real? So it's not just artistic license?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 16.ogg Dvorak: You're all so helpful and kind, I really... I just...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 17.ogg Dvorak: ...You're right. Okay! I'm going to pull out all the stops to make this Lantern Rite a true extravaganza.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 18.ogg Dvorak: I was wondering, what are your thoughts on music? What does it mean to you?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 19.ogg Dvorak: Heh... truth be told, the question of what music means to people is one that I've been pondering for quite some time...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 dvorak 20.ogg Dvorak: Let's revisit this question after the concert.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 01.ogg Ganyu: ...and when you meet with the Ministry of Civil Affairs, please remind them that the festivities are not an excuse to procrastinate their work.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 02.ogg Ganyu: What brings you here, Yaoyao?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 03.ogg Ganyu: Ahem...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 04.ogg Ganyu: Thank you, (Traveler), but Paimon's criticism is quite valid. I do have a tendency to neglect matters outside of work, and that's something I should improve on.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 05.ogg Ganyu: Oh, my apologies, I don't believe we've been introduced?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 06.ogg Ganyu: Hmm...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 07.ogg Ganyu: It may be... a little difficult to make this happen.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 08.ogg Ganyu: Well, the Lantern Rite is the most important festival of the year. Our celebrations must not only be visually spectacular, but also appeal to the tastes of Liyue citizens from all walks of life.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 09.ogg Ganyu: The Iridescence Tour is relatively unknown in Liyue. It's difficult to predict how a brand-new show will be received.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 10.ogg Ganyu: It would be quite risky for us to bet everything on this one music festival.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 11.ogg Ganyu: Therefore, we will not replace or cancel any of our preexisting program. However... I will submit a proposal requesting to put the Iridescence Tour special performance as the final act of this year's festivities.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 12.ogg Ganyu: Some live music will certainly add to the festive atmosphere on the night of the Lantern Rite. As for the venue... Hmm, let's reserve a space at the docks.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 13.ogg Ganyu: Yes. My thoughts precisely.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 14.ogg Ganyu: Now I just need to take some time to give this proposal some polish...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 15.ogg Ganyu: As long as I clearly lay out the pros and cons, and highlight the key points of the proposal... Given that Ping and (Traveler) have both given the idea their blessing, I'm confident the Qixing will be sure to give it serious consideration.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 16.ogg Ganyu: Mr. Dvorak, I will need to discuss with you the number of musicians who will be coming to Liyue, as well as their catering and accommodation requirements...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 17.ogg Ganyu: ...Here's what I've drafted so far. Anything else you want to add?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 18.ogg Ganyu: Perfect, then we'll leave it as-is. I'll go make an official copy.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 19.ogg Ganyu: Oh, perfect timing. We were just wrapping up our discussion here.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 20.ogg Ganyu: Not at all. Every second counts for a complex proposal such as this. I will inform the Qixing of this development immediately... please give me a moment to pass on the message.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 21.ogg Ganyu: Yaoyao, thank you for bringing my herbs. I will make sure to take them.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 22.ogg Ganyu: ...Uh, I—I will.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 23.ogg Ganyu: ...Oh.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 24.ogg Ganyu: They told me all about Mr. Dvorak's situation, but I was so engrossed in drafting the proposal that I forgot all about it...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 25.ogg Ganyu: Thanks. It was just that I had a few initial thoughts when I heard your story. For instance... I wonder if this lady your ancestor met might have been an adeptus. What do you think?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 26.ogg Ganyu: To tell you the truth, Mr. Dvorak, I am somewhat related to the adepti myself. I am part-human and part-qilin. The qilin is an illuminated beast.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 27.ogg Ganyu: I know how important your quest to get in touch with your roots must be to you, because I've been there myself before... trying to find out where I belonged...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 28.ogg Ganyu: Yes. Anyway... if you're looking to uncover a lost melody, or shine light on a forgotten aspect of Liyue's cultural history, I'm probably not the best person to ask.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 29.ogg Ganyu: But if it's a person you're looking for, then I just might be able to help.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 30.ogg Ganyu: Yes, that was also my thought.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 31.ogg Ganyu: I can probably get through everything in... two days. As long as I don't sleep.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 32.ogg Ganyu: ...In that case, three days.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 33.ogg Ganyu: If you have the time, would you join me for this search?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 34.ogg Ganyu: You're well-known to many of the adepti, and respected among the people. I'll feel much more at ease with your company.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 ganyu 35.ogg Ganyu: Okay, then let's meet back here in three days.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: Greetings, (Traveler), Paimon, and Mr. Dvorak. Call me Keqing.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 02.ogg Keqing: Ganyu has brought me up to speed on everything. I'll get straight to the point.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 03.ogg Keqing: The Qixing have approved Ganyu's proposal. Over the next few days, I will be working with Mr. Dvorak on behalf of the Qixing to facilitate the organization of this concert.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 04.ogg Keqing: Please. The Qixing have a duty to deal with matters such as these. We have merely moved things forward to the next step.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 05.ogg Keqing: On a more personal note, I am an avid supporter of all things new and innovative.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 06.ogg Keqing: As such, it is my privilege to work with you on this exciting project.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 07.ogg Keqing: Ganyu, what's wrong?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 08.ogg Keqing: ...I see, I think I understand the situation now. In that case, Ganyu, shall we divide the work between us?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 09.ogg Keqing: Great. So, Mr. Dvorak and I will concentrate on things here in the city to make sure the concert goes according to plan. In the meantime, Ganyu will reach out to her network and try to find the person he's looking for.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 10.ogg Keqing: How's your workload at the moment? Will you be able to make time?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 11.ogg Keqing: Wait, what do you mean, "as long as I don't sleep"?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 12.ogg Keqing: Even for someone with illuminated beast blood in their veins, working for such an extended period without a break will take its toll on your health.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 13.ogg Keqing: "Be it but three moons from the start, he who returns is not he that departs."
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 14.ogg Keqing: Hm! Even I know the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance!
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 15.ogg Keqing: Alright, I can work with that.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 keqing 16.ogg Keqing: We should probably get going. Mr. Dvorak, could you come with me to confirm the site?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Well this is weird. It's like a responsible younger sister talking to their disorganized older sister...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ah! Paimon will do the honors!
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wh—What's wrong? Did Paimon go over everything a bit too fast?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: It's definitely an ambitious plan... If there's anything you didn't quite catch, Paimon's more than happy to go over it again!
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: As soon as there's work to do, Ganyu's as diligent as ever...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Wow... Hey, Yaoyao, can you take care of Paimon too? Paimon's getting hungry again!
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Anything sweet! And anything that's made from slimes...
(After a while)
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: We should go get dinner together sometime!
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Yay, that's awesome!
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Yes! Our music man's finally getting fired up!
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: You bet they're real! Trying to track them down is tough, though... Like Jueyun Karst itself. There's nothing specifically stopping you from going there, but getting in and out of there is quite an ordeal.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Somehow, that does not sound persuasive coming from Keqing...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Watch this space, Mr. Dvorak! We'll get to the bottom of this.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Just think... imagine if we found the adeptus lady or one of her descendants and got them to come to the performance. Wouldn't that be amazing?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: It'd be such a happy reunion! And that's exactly what this festival's all about!
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Ooh! We're coming too!
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Uhh... Music... sounds... nice?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 yaoyao 01.ogg Yaoyao: Ganyuuu!
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 yaoyao 02.ogg Yaoyao: I've brought all the medicine you asked me to pick for you. Ah, and here's a pack of Sweet Flower seeds as well.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 yaoyao 03.ogg Yaoyao: Also, also, these dried Qingxin leaves make a great pot of tea that's very good for you.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 yaoyao 04.ogg Yaoyao: I know you've had a lot to deal with at work recently, but you shouldn't push yourself too hard. If you're not careful, you'll end up falling asleep in the grass again...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 yaoyao 05.ogg Yaoyao: I couldn't agree more!
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 yaoyao 06.ogg Yaoyao: Master once said that everyone has things that they are good at, and things that they are less good at. So, with that in mind, Ganyu shouldn't feel compelled to become perfect at absolutely everything.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 yaoyao 07.ogg Yaoyao: I'm good at taking care of people, so that can be left to me.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 yaoyao 08.ogg Yaoyao: I'm afraid my backpack's empty now, but if you let me know what you like, I can bring you some of your favorite dishes next time we meet.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 yaoyao 09.ogg Yaoyao: Apart from Lotus Flower Crisps, what else do you like?
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 yaoyao 10.ogg Yaoyao: Remember to make tea from them first, Ganyu! You mustn't just chew them raw.
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 yaoyao 11.ogg Yaoyao: Okay, I should be getting back. If Yaoyao stays out for too long, Mom and Dad will be worried sick...
Media:vo eqhdj201 5 yaoyao 12a.ogg Yaoyao: Everyone, I'm sure that the music festival will go off without a hitch, so don't worry! And in case I don't see you before, I wish you all a very happy Lantern Rite.
Media:vo eqhdj201 6 baiwen 01.ogg Baiwen: Lady Yuheng!
Media:vo eqhdj201 6 baiwen 02.ogg Baiwen: Per Lady Ningguang's orders, I've been gathering intelligence outside of the city with the goal of uncovering and dispatching any trouble ahead of the festival.
Media:vo eqhdj201 6 baiwen 03.ogg Baiwen: I am told that a strange melody was heard somewhere along the coast. I was wary of investigating further on my own, so I was just on my way to report this incident to Lady Ningguang...
Media:vo eqhdj201 6 baiwen 04.ogg Baiwen: But I'm worried that if we don't act right away, we may miss the window of opportunity to take appropriate action...
Media:vo eqhdj201 6 baiwen 05.ogg Baiwen: With (Traveler) on the case, it's as good as dealt with...
Media:vo eqhdj201 6 baiwen 06.ogg Baiwen: Thank you, this will be a great help. I will inform Lady Ningguang about the situation. Once it's resolved, please come and find me again at Yujing Terrace and let me know.
Media:vo eqhdj201 6 dvorak 01.ogg Dvorak: Good luck.
Media:vo eqhdj201 6 keqing 01.ogg Keqing: Baiwen, what is it?
Media:vo eqhdj201 6 keqing 02.ogg Keqing: I understand. In that case, I—
Media:vo eqhdj201 6 keqing 03.ogg Keqing: You have my thanks too. Stay safe, and come back as soon as you're finished.
Media:vo eqhdj201 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yeah! Keqing, you're busy enough as it is. There's a ton of different things in this city that needs your attention.
Media:vo eqhdj201 6 paimon 02a.ogg Media:vo eqhdj201 6 paimon 02b.ogg Paimon: Leave it to us! Don't worry — whatever it is, we'll definitely be able to handle it. Uh... Well, (he/she) will handle it.
Media:vo eqhdj201 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Will do! And say hi to Ningguang for us!
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Baiwen said the strange tune was coming from around here, right?
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: But Paimon doesn't hear anything... There doesn't seem to be a soul in—
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yelan!? How did you sneak up on us like that? You nearly gave Paimon a heart attack!
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Y—You... ehh, fair enough...
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: This place is completely empty... There's nothing valuable left here at all...
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hm, the stuff by the door is in pretty good condition, though. It can't have been too long ago that someone was last living here...
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: The doors and windows are all fine, so there definitely wasn't a break-in...
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Hmm, how strange. It looks like it's been looted, except for the fact that there's no sign of a struggle.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: The bad guys could have sneaked in while the owner was gone, but... then how do you explain why the door and windows are intact?
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Yelan, you didn't hide some of the evidence from us on purpose, did you?
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Okay, well... Paimon gives up then. Paimon's got nothin'.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Whew, that's quite the story...
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: So basically... if we wanna find the culprit, we just need to follow Yelan!
(The Traveler and Paimon follow Yelan)
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 01.ogg Yelan: I was just wondering who in their right mind would come out to a place like this. So, it's you two.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 02.ogg Yelan: You look pretty alive to me. Can't have spooked you that bad.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 03.ogg Yelan: Ah, you're here for that, too? Saves me a bit of explaining.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 04.ogg Yelan: Come with me. I've already reconned the perimeter, so we should be safe.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 05.ogg Yelan: Seems you've done a pretty thorough inspection. So, any theories on what might have happened here?
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 06.ogg Yelan: Why would I make this more difficult for you? We're on the same side here.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 07.ogg Yelan: What about you? Give up as well?
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 08a 1.ogg Yelan: Yup. It's not obvious at first sight, that's for sure.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 08a 2.ogg Yelan: To be honest, I was only able to put it all together because of some background knowledge about this area.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 08b 1.ogg Yelan: Your instincts are pretty good.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 08b 2.ogg Yelan: Hmm, or perhaps it's not instinct. The strange melody is one of the few pieces of information you have available, after all.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 08b 3.ogg Yelan: Let me share a folk story with you.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 09.ogg Yelan: A long time ago, there used to be a group of bandits in the Liyue countryside who would sound a horn every time they were about to raid a village.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 10.ogg Yelan: But it wasn't a rallying cry to rouse their fellow men. It was a disconcerting tune, meant to intimidate the weak and warn them of their impending doom.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 11.ogg Yelan: To escape with their lives, the villagers would abandon their homes and flee overnight, taking only their most valuable belongings with them. Everything else was left behind.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 12.ogg Yelan: The bandits were eventually brought to justice. But the fear and trauma remained in the villagers' hearts.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 13.ogg Yelan: Whenever they heard that melody, they would feel like their lives were in danger once again, and flee immediately.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 14.ogg Yelan: The culprit of this crime exploited that very fear to get access to this house without having to force their way in.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 15.ogg Yelan: The victims obviously will have gotten quite a fright, but at least they won't be in any great danger.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 16.ogg Yelan: The important thing now is to find this copycat criminal.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 17.ogg Yelan: On any other day, that'd probably be a good idea. Unfortunately, it's not gonna work today.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 18.ogg Yelan: Take a look around and you'll see what I mean. This criminal is clearly well-versed both in using music to commit crimes and in making a clean getaway.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 19.ogg Yelan: Not only did they stay off the muddy road to avoid leaving footprints, it looks like they were also careful not to bring any gadgets with so much as a trace of elemental energy. Evidently, they were intent on keeping even the most experienced investigators off their trail.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 20.ogg Yelan: Unfortunately for them, I'm one of the best trackers in the business. They're not about to get away with their little scheme on my watch.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 21.ogg Yelan: Mm-hmm. As long as you can keep up.
Media:vo eqhdj201 7 yelan 22.ogg Yelan: Since the culprit's trying to be cautious and low-risk, I'll bet they left through an area with some vegetation for cover — but not so much that it would slow them down.
Media:vo eqhdj201 8 yelan 01.ogg Yelan: Here, look at this.
Media:vo eqhdj201 8 yelan 02.ogg Yelan: These tracks are superficial, but they definitely didn't occur naturally. Something heavy was being dragged this way... meaning, we're headed in the right direction.
Media:vo eqhdj201 8 yelan 03.ogg Yelan: Huh, their pace has increased... Normally, people carrying a heavy load slow down as their journey goes on and they start to tire.
Media:vo eqhdj201 8 yelan 04.ogg Yelan: Whatever's motivating them to speed up must be psychological. For instance... reaching the home stretch.
Media:vo eqhdj201 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: There they are! Look, a Treasure Hoarder tent!
Media:vo eqhdj201 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ugh, not the Treasure Hoarders again! And so close to Lantern Rite, too... 'Tis not the season for their antics!
Media:vo eqhdj201 9 yelan 01.ogg Yelan: C'mon, let's round 'em up.

This is where Yelan comes in, with her task being to clean these corners up by dint of her exceptional capabilities as an intelligence agent.
