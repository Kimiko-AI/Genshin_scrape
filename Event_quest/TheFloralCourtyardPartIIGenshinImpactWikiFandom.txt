Fushizome: That's alright. Ikebana requires one's full attention, after all.
Fushizome: Once you have completed the various tasks you have on hand, rendering yourself free of disturbances, I'm certain that your floral courtyard shall be all the more perfect for it.

Fushizome: We meet again, you two.
Paimon: Yup! We're ready as can be!
