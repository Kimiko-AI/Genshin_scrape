Xingqiu: That figure was none other than Aoi no Okina himself
Xingqiu: This turn of events had begun with an unnamed individual
Xingqiu: Under whose coercion Aoi no Okina was forced
Xingqiu: To take drastic measures to retrieve a page of poetry
Xingqiu: He knew nothing
Xingqiu: Of this individual's true intentions
Xingqiu: All he knew was that
Xingqiu: The poem had to do with an old acquaintance, Akahito
(Cinematic ends)
 Ahem!
 Got it.
 I bet it has something to do with his signature.
 I learned some new tips on manners today.
 It's a possibility.
 It's a real eye-opener, that's for sure.
 No, there was something really suspicious.
 Paimon, you're so terrible at making up stories!

Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 03a.ogg Xingqiu: While it is entertaining to read novels, writing one is an endeavor of its own.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 03a 1.ogg Xingqiu: You must give great thought to every detail, from the layout of the plot to the rhythm of the lines.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 03a 2.ogg Xingqiu: And even when you have come up with interesting content, there's still no guarantee that it will be to your liking.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 albedo 02a.ogg Albedo: I couldn't agree more.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 albedo 02a 1.ogg Albedo: Whether it's writing a book, creating art, or studying alchemy, seldom can you really feel joy after seriously delving into the work.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 05a.ogg Paimon: Xingqiu and Albedo are getting into some deep topics now, but nothing suspicious has come up...
 Talk about Albedo's illustrations.
 Talk about his thoughts regarding the journey.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 02a.ogg Xingqiu: Well, I've never embarked on such a long journey before. Though I was quite excited when we set off, the long days at sea quickly became most monotonous.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 04a.ogg Paimon: Oh, speaking of the journey, did anything noteworthy happen along the way?
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 02a 1.ogg Xingqiu: Well, to be honest, I spent most of the trip with my nose in a novel, haha.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 04a 1.ogg Paimon: Well, that didn't tell us much...
(Option removed, dialogue returns to option selection)
 Talk about the book he read during the voyage.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 04b.ogg Paimon: By the way, Xingqiu, what book were you reading on the way here?
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 02b.ogg Xingqiu: Oh, I was reading a novel called, "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?". It was sent to me by my editor.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 04b 1.ogg Paimon: Didn't you feel dizzy while reading on the ship?
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 02b 1.ogg Xingqiu: Haha, it was nothing I couldn't handle. Don't forget, I'm proficient in the arts of the Guhua Clan. That being said, there were quite a few people aboard who felt seasick.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 04b 2.ogg Paimon: Well, there doesn't seem to be anything suspicious about what he's said so far...
(Option removed, dialogue returns to option selection)
 Talk about the scenery on the journey.
 Uh oh, he's on to us!
 What's wrong?
 Xingqiu was a little suspicious.
 Xingqiu, how are you doing?
 Xingqiu, what's with the facade?
 You seem a little down.
Aoi no Okina's Likeness: (The source material does state that Aoi no Okina was a much older person, but... Oh well, Miko probably won't mind!)
Aoi no Okina's Likeness: (This is Aoi no Okina's likeness, as done by Albedo.)
Aoi no Okina's Likeness: (Xingqiu was the model for this portrait, and it depicts Aoi no Okina stealing away the poems that he himself had written, complete with some special touches from Xingqiu's own Liyue-styled clothes.)
Media:vo rcjeq003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: The passenger ship from Liyue that we're supposed to meet should be arriving soon. Let's go to the docks.
Media:vo rcjeq003 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: You know that Xingqiu will be on board, right? So we should be careful not to say anything about the stolen novels.
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: I always used to prefer working alone in my workshop, but I have come to realize that solving problems with others also has its merits.
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: No problem. Considering the similarities between the portrait and the events that have taken place, your proposal is very reasonable.
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 hirayama 01.ogg Hirayama: Onodera? What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be on leave these few days?
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 hirayama 02.ogg Hirayama: *sigh* Yes, Onodera, but...
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 hirayama 03.ogg Hirayama: Why didn't you tell everyone earlier? If you had told us, we could've thought of some ways to help you.
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 hirayama 04.ogg Hirayama: Let's leave the past behind us now. Our first priority is to help Zhenyu with his signatures. How is your progress so far?
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 hirayama 05.ogg Hirayama: I understand. Murata, go back to Yae Publishing House and get Aratani to book a room on the second floor of the Uyuu Restaurant. We'll be using it for Zhenyu's emergency calligraphy lessons!
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 hirayama 06.ogg Hirayama: Yes, good idea. Ah, you've just reminded me... Two calligraphers from Liyue arrived today. We have worked with them before, so I'll go and ask them to help out, too.
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 murata 01.ogg Murata: That's right. We're a team, and we should be helping each other in tough situations like this.
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 murata 02.ogg Murata: Yes, Mr. Hirayama! It just so happens that my brother is a calligrapher, should I ask him to lend his assistance as well?
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 onodera 01.ogg Onodera: I'm very sorry for all the trouble that I've caused!
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 onodera 02.ogg Onodera: No need to worry, Zhenyu. I'm sure you can do it! Didn't you finish the last chapter of your novel in just one week's time?
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh, no wonder Xingqiu looked so sleepy today.
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Even though Xingqiu still has to deal with his handwriting issue, Paimon somehow feels a little relieved now.
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh? You mean whoever left behind those stories about The Five Kasen?
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh right, we haven't had a chance to explain things to Xingqiu yet.
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 venti 01.ogg Venti: We also owe a special ode of gratitude to the mysterious person who has been leaving important info for us along the way.
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 xingqiu 01.ogg Xingqiu: My progress is not what I had hoped for... Even after working through the night these past few days, I've only finished perhaps one-tenth of the signatures.
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 xingqiu 02.ogg Xingqiu: It seems I'm really in for it now...
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 xingqiu 03.ogg Xingqiu: Yes, but writing novels and learning calligraphy are two entirely different skills!
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 xingqiu 04.ogg Xingqiu: Pardon me, but what are you talking about?
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 xingqiu 05.ogg Xingqiu: I see, it appears that Onodera and I were spotted when we were moving the books.
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 xingqiu 06.ogg Xingqiu: Albedo, may I ask you one thing? Are you able to include me in a portrait as well?
Media:vo rcjeq003 10 xingqiu 07.ogg Xingqiu: Not only do I owe the successful resolution of today's incident to that story, but I also hope that I'll remember this lesson.
Media:vo rcjeq003 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Albedo really is something. He finished the portrait of Aoi no Okina in no time at all.
Media:vo rcjeq003 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wonder how Xingqiu's calligraphy training is going at Uyuu Restaurant. Hey, (Traveler), do you think whoever left those stories for us could be hiding somewhere nearby?
Media:vo rcjeq003 11 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, hellooo! Mr. story writer! Are you here? Uh, could you please help Xingqiu with something?
Media:vo rcjeq003 11 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: He's a friend of ours, and the release of his new book is super important to him!
Media:vo rcjeq003 11 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh! What's that sound!?
Media:vo rcjeq003 11 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Hehe, it was just a cat. Looks like we can't make them reveal themselves that easily.
Media:vo rcjeq003 11 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: It's getting late now. Let's go back and get some rest. We still have to go to the docks and wait for another ship tomorrow morning.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hi there! You must be visiting from Liyue to participate in the Irodori Festival. We'll be your guides and will take you onto the island.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh, is it Paimon or have we met somewhere before?
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, speaking of which, where's the young master?
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Whoa, Xingqiu's just sitting there... sound asleep!
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: We aren't actually guests, we're actually guides for the Irodori Festival.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Let Paimon have a look!
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: *gasp* There's no doubt about it! It's from the same series as the story we found before. Even the handwriting looks exactly the same!
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Oh yeah, in the warehouse down by the—
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Uh, by the... the Poem Hunt competition!
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Yeah, that's it! A friend of ours is on Ritou to paint portraits of The Five Kasen... You know, as part of the Irodori Festival. Poetic stories about The Five Kasen have been hidden in various places nearby!
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: If you can find one of the stories and give it to this friend of ours, then there's a chance you'll become the model for the next portrait!
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: H—Hey, it's hard coming up with stuff on the spot like that!
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Huh? Oh, uh, yeah... you could say that.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Don't worry, Xingqiu. Even though Calx has work to do, he still has time to see friends. We can take you to see him right now.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Also, we heard that Calx did illustrations for your A Legend of Sword novel.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Phew... Luckily, the idea of meeting Albedo managed to draw Xingqiu's attention and keep the situation under wraps. Let's just hope we don't let anything slip while meeting Albedo.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 01.ogg Xingqiu: ...Huh, wha—
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 02.ogg Xingqiu: Oh... *yawn* It's (Traveler) and Paimon. I presume you are guests in Inazuma as well? It seems fate has destined our paths to cross once again.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 03.ogg Xingqiu: Please, no need to worry. I was a little too caught up in a novel on the voyage here. When I finally realized what time it was, the first rays of dawn were already peeking over the horizon.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 04.ogg Xingqiu: Ah yes, now that we've arrived, the Kanjou Commission will likely wish to inspect our invitation letter. Let's keep it in hand, shall we?
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 05.ogg Xingqiu: Huh, that's odd...
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 06.ogg Xingqiu: There was a piece of paper underneath my bag... Strange, I don't recall seeing it there before.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 07.ogg Xingqiu: The story you found before?
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 08.ogg Xingqiu: Wait a moment, so you mean that...
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 09.ogg Xingqiu: ...There is a chance of meeting Calx in person!?
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 10.ogg Xingqiu: Really? That's wonderful! I knew that Calx would attend the Irodori Festival, but convincing my father to let me come to Inazuma was proving to be quite the high hurdle. I had to really rack my mind to come up with the excuse of evaluating the investment value of Theater Mechanicus.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 11.ogg Xingqiu: Just a few days later, word then came that Calx would be busy painting portraits of The Five Kasen during the festival.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 12.ogg Xingqiu: It is a most rare opportunity for both Calx and I to be in Inazuma together, but it seemed he would be too busy with the portraits to meet with me... So, I've felt quite disappointed for some time now.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 13.ogg Xingqiu: Ah, so you've already heard.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 14.ogg Xingqiu: To be honest, my works have drawn little interest in Liyue. However, the novels are selling quite well in Inazuma with the help of Calx's beautiful illustrations.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 15.ogg Xingqiu: Calx is not only a skilled artist, but he also carries out his craft with great alacrity. I heard that it took him merely a few hours to finish the illustrations for the latest chapter.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 16.ogg Xingqiu: But when I looked at the art, the brushwork did not even look the slightest bit rushed. His work is truly exquisite...
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xingqiu 17.ogg Xingqiu: Oh my, I was beginning to get carried away there. Let us depart, quickly now.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xu 01.ogg Xu: Haha. Yes, in fact, we have. I am Xu from Feiyun Commerce Guild. Aboard this ship, we have calligraphers, painters, and even players of Theater Mechanicus.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xu 02.ogg Xu: The inventor of Theater Mechanicus previously came to the Feiyun Commerce Guild seeking investment. Although the guild manager was not interested, Master still wanted to support them.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xu 03.ogg Xu: We heard that they'd be demonstrating the game and letting people try Theater Mechanicus at the Irodori Festival. So the guild manager instructed Master and I to take the opportunity to come to Inazuma and investigate the product's potential.
Media:vo rcjeq003 2 xu 04.ogg Xu: Ah, well... Master, he's uh...
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Traveler, Paimon, how are you? And who is this accompanying you?
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: And you may call me Albedo, then.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Why not? Seeing as we are both friends of (Traveler), it'd be more convenient for us to use our real names.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: Besides, we've already corresponded with each other many times before. In fact, I feel a bit self-conscious seeing you act so politely.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: Hmm? Poem Hunt?
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: Huh?... Oh, yes. That's right.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: I understand the story now. Thank you, it's very helpful.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: If all of you are free, why don't we discuss this over a meal?
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: Shimura's? Unfortunately, today is a bit windy, how about Uyuu Restaurant instead?
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: Hmm, something didn't quite add up just now...
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: No, Paimon, I'm not referring to us. (Traveler), what are your thoughts?
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: Paimon, you read the poem, right? Although it may seem confusing to Xingqiu on its own, what if we read it together with the previous poem we found?
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 13.ogg Albedo: And that is precisely the point of suspicion. If Xingqiu had only just arrived in Inazuma, how could he recommend Shimura's Chazuke?
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 14.ogg Albedo: Moreover, he didn't raise any questions when I suggested another place because of the windy weather. This means he knows that Shimura's is an open-air restaurant.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 15.ogg Albedo: Yes, that is indeed my conclusion.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 16.ogg Albedo: Calm down, Paimon. Even though this is the first time I've met Xingqiu in person, we've communicated via letters for some time now. I do have some understanding of his character.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 17.ogg Albedo: I think there must be some deeper motive at play here. The story also tells us that Aoi no Okina flees with the poem because of a threat.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 18.ogg Albedo: It's difficult to say at this point. But given that Uyuu Restaurant is indoors, it will be easy for us to detect anyone following or eavesdropping on us. I think it should be safe for us to talk there.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 19.ogg Albedo: I'll be relying on your assistance to get to the bottom of this matter.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 albedo 20.ogg Albedo: Good. Then let's head to Uyuu Restaurant.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hehe, it's not just you, Albedo. We haven't seen Xingqiu act this awkward before either.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Y—You know... The thing where we have to find pieces of paper with stories of The Five Kasen! Uh, Venti found one and then he was allowed to be a model for one of your portraits, hehe.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Do you have other plans, Xingqiu?
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Huh, no way! Paimon thinks we acted well together. Did we say something we weren't supposed to?
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh? Xingqiu's suspicious? Hey, what are you two talking about?
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Read them together? Hmm, let's see...
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Suikou lost Aoi no Okina's poem in a drunken stupor, so Aoi no Okina recovered the poem and gave it to some mysterious person...
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Huh? Wait a minute... Could today's story be hinting that the one who stole the latest copies of A Legend of Sword... Is Xingqiu himself!?
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: No way, that can't be right! Xingqiu only arrived at Inazuma this morning.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Are you saying that Xingqiu has already been in Inazuma for some time and that he's only pretending he just arrived?
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: But, how could Xingqiu be the book thief!? His mission is to fight for justice, isn't it? There's no way he'd do something against his own ideals!
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Oh? Could Xingqiu be in danger?
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 xingqiu 01.ogg Xingqiu: You must be Calx, it's a great pleasure to finally meet you. I am the author of A Legend of Sword, Zhen...
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 xingqiu 02.ogg Xingqiu: Ah, forgive me... It's rude of me to introduce myself by my pen name when meeting in person. Please, call me Xingqiu.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 xingqiu 03.ogg Xingqiu: No, no, that would be most improper...
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 xingqiu 04.ogg Xingqiu: Ahem... you guys... It's certainly not good taste for you two to be teasing me like that.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 xingqiu 05.ogg Xingqiu: Oh, by the way, we happened to find a story from the Poem Hunt competition at the docks. I heard that you are collecting them.
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 xingqiu 06.ogg Xingqiu: Splendid. Though, I'm still piecing together the story myself. Would you kindly explain it to me in more detail?
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 xingqiu 07.ogg Xingqiu: Ah, well, about that...
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 xingqiu 08.ogg Xingqiu: No no, not at all! Speaking of dining, Shimura's Unagi Chazuke is quite delicious, would you like to go there?
Media:vo rcjeq003 3 xingqiu 09.ogg Xingqiu: That's perfectly fine with me. But, I must first unpack my luggage. Let's meet later at Uyuu Restaurant.
Media:vo rcjeq003 4 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: I don't see anyone suspicious around, it seems clear for the moment. Let's go inside and wait for Xingqiu.
Media:vo rcjeq003 4 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: First, we must ascertain whether Xingqiu was already in Inazuma or not. If we can find evidence of him deceiving us, then we can use it as leverage to persuade him to tell us the truth.
Media:vo rcjeq003 4 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Since we're still waiting for him, why don't you go and chat with other guests in the restaurant and see if you can learn anything useful?
Media:vo rcjeq003 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh, this whole thing's starting to make Paimon a little nervous. What do we do? And what do we talk about when Xingqiu gets here...?
Media:vo rcjeq003 5 okazakirikuto 01.ogg Okazaki Rikuto: Hello there, what can I get for you?
Media:vo rcjeq003 5 okazakirikuto 02.ogg Okazaki Rikuto: Why of course, I'd personally recommend our freshly caught seafood! It's been pouring these past few days, so the fishing boats haven't been able to sail at all. But the weather finally cleared up today, so we have some fresh catch.
Media:vo rcjeq003 5 okazakirikuto 03.ogg Okazaki Rikuto: It sure has, a few guests from Liyue were just telling me that their boat was heaving and rolling all the way here. They couldn't do anything but sleep the entire trip.
Media:vo rcjeq003 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hi, do you have any special recommendations today?
Media:vo rcjeq003 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So the weather at sea has been bad these past few days...
Media:vo rcjeq003 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, this might be some useful information.
Media:vo rcjeq003 6 akito 01.ogg Akito: That's right! A signed first edition is gonna become quite the collectible. I've gotta get my hands on a copy!
Media:vo rcjeq003 6 akito 02.ogg Akito: He'll be there in person on the day of the release, so we'll get a good look at him then. I hear that he's actually pretty young.
Media:vo rcjeq003 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wait a minute, did you just hear that? Not only will Xingqiu be signing novels at the release... but his handwriting is "super neat"!?
Media:vo rcjeq003 6 youta 01.ogg Youta: The last phase of the Irodori Festival is when they release all the new publications. The one I'm really looking forward to is A Legend of Sword!
Media:vo rcjeq003 6 youta 02.ogg Youta: I've seen Zhenyu's signature before. His handwriting is super neat, he must be really diligent about his style.
Media:vo rcjeq003 7 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Hmm, I will try to break the ice by talking about our work on novels and illustrations.
Media:vo rcjeq003 7 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: If he really is hiding something, then he might feel even more nervous than we do. If we start by talking about our work creating novels, perhaps he will lower his guard.
Media:vo rcjeq003 7 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Is that so? Hmm, that is also a very valuable clue.
Media:vo rcjeq003 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Albedo, what should we talk about when Xingqiu gets here? Any ideas?
Media:vo rcjeq003 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, come to think of it, Xingqiu mentioned that he'd like to thank you for finishing the illustrations on time. He said they looked amazing despite the time you had.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: We learned a couple of things from his account, but we still require more evidence. Let's discuss creating novels with Xingqiu.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 albedo 02a 1.ogg Albedo: Whether it's writing a book, creating art, or studying alchemy, seldom can you really feel joy after seriously delving into the work.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 albedo 02a.ogg Albedo: I couldn't agree more.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 albedo 02b 1.ogg Albedo: Light novel illustrations are typically centered around the characters, but this time, I adopted a different approach in the illustration for the last chapter.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 albedo 02b 2.ogg Albedo: No, there was a crack in his alibi. My illustrations were sent for printing the moment they arrived in Inazuma. So logically speaking, there's no way he could possibly know what the illustrations look like.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 albedo 02b.ogg Albedo: Thank you. However, I took some risks in the illustrations, so I'm feeling slightly uneasy myself.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Xingqiu, we have something very important to ask you now.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: On top of that, the latest installment of A Legend of Sword will only be revealed at the Irodori Festival. Even we, the creators, haven't received a sample copy. If that's the case, how could you know what my illustrations look like?
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hehe, that's good, we were worried you might not have an appetite because you didn't sleep well.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Now's our chance, (Traveler). Let's talk to Xingqiu and see if he says anything useful!
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Maybe we could start by asking him about the journey.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 04a 1.ogg Paimon: Well, that didn't tell us much...
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 04a.ogg Paimon: Oh, speaking of the journey, did anything noteworthy happen along the way?
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 04b 1.ogg Paimon: Didn't you feel dizzy while reading on the ship?
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 04b 2.ogg Paimon: Well, there doesn't seem to be anything suspicious about what he's said so far...
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 04b.ogg Paimon: By the way, Xingqiu, what book were you reading on the way here?
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 04c 1.ogg Paimon: Oh, right... If it took an entire day to reach the docks, then it would have been pouring rain at the time they saw the top of the mountain!
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 04c.ogg Paimon: Paimon didn't catch anything suspicious so far...
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 05a.ogg Paimon: Xingqiu and Albedo are getting into some deep topics now, but nothing suspicious has come up...
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 05b.ogg Paimon: Hmm, doesn't sound like anything suspicious has come up so far...
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Mr. Okazaki told us earlier that actually the weather at sea was very bad these last few days. So, when you said that everyone came running to the deck to see Mt. Yougou, that couldn't have happened.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: The jig's up, Xingqiu. You were already in Inazuma before today, weren't you?
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Are you in some kind of danger but can't tell us the truth? Don't worry, (Traveler) and Albedo are no pushovers, we can help you!
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Huh? Tone-Deaf Bard, what are you doing here...?
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Hmph, Paimon knew you couldn't possibly be up to anything good.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 venti 01.ogg Venti: Oh ho? Well, if this isn't a coincidence! I didn't expect to see everyone here.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 venti 02.ogg Venti: Haha, I heard that the owner of this establishment has some fine aged wines. I didn't want to miss the opportunity to taste them.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 venti 03.ogg Venti: Says who? In fact, I come as the bearer of good tidings.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 venti 04.ogg Venti: I just bumped into Kujou Sara a moment ago. She said that the Tenryou Commission has apprehended the criminal who stole all those copies of A Legend of Sword. You needn't worry about it any longer.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 venti 05.ogg Venti: Uh, did I say something I shouldn't have?
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 venti 06.ogg Venti: Apologies, Kujou Sara didn't mention a name, but I saw her taking someone toward Hanamizaka.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 01.ogg Xingqiu: That was delicious. Inazuman cuisine largely consists of fresh seafood, which is certainly to my liking.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 02a 1.ogg Xingqiu: Well, to be honest, I spent most of the trip with my nose in a novel, haha.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 02a.ogg Xingqiu: Well, I've never embarked on such a long journey before. Though I was quite excited when we set off, the long days at sea quickly became most monotonous.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 02b 1.ogg Xingqiu: Haha, it was nothing I couldn't handle. Don't forget, I'm proficient in the arts of the Guhua Clan. That being said, there were quite a few people aboard who felt seasick.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 02b.ogg Xingqiu: Oh, I was reading a novel called, "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?". It was sent to me by my editor.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 02c 1.ogg Xingqiu: So, when the peak of Mt. Yougou finally appeared in the distance as we approached the islands of Inazuma, everyone crowded the deck to have a look.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 02c 2.ogg Xingqiu: However, the ship sailed along at a crawling pace, it took a whole day from the time we saw the mountain peak to the time we docked.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 02c.ogg Xingqiu: To be honest, there wasn't much to see, just water all around, morning to night. The sheer monotony of the trip caused everyone to grow a little impatient.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 03a 1.ogg Xingqiu: You must give great thought to every detail, from the layout of the plot to the rhythm of the lines.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 03a 2.ogg Xingqiu: And even when you have come up with interesting content, there's still no guarantee that it will be to your liking.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 03a.ogg Xingqiu: While it is entertaining to read novels, writing one is an endeavor of its own.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 03b 1.ogg Xingqiu: My novel didn't sell well in Liyue, so I must admit that I had some reservations regarding its potential.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 03b 2.ogg Xingqiu: Yet you've consistently managed to select the most important scene of the chapter for your illustrations. This made me feel as though what I was trying to express could be understood, after all.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 03b 3.ogg Xingqiu: Well, that scene was intended to depict the change in the world, so I thought it very fitting to draw only scenery.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 03b.ogg Xingqiu: Speaking of illustrations, Albedo, I've long wished to express my sincerest gratitude for providing the illustrations in my novel.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 04.ogg Xingqiu: Oh? Why the solemn looks all of a sudden...
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 05.ogg Xingqiu: Huh? I'm afraid I don't follow.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 06.ogg Xingqiu: Uh, well...
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 07.ogg Xingqiu: No, no! Please, you misunderstand me.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 08.ogg Xingqiu: *sigh* I suppose my lack of sleep is inevitably taking its toll on my mind. I didn't notice for a moment that you were testing me at all.
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 09.ogg Xingqiu: I did in fact come to Inazuma early to handle some things. Let me consider how to explain this. *sigh* Oh, this is most embarrassing...
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 10.ogg Xingqiu: Huh! The criminal who stole... A Legend of Sword!?
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 11.ogg Xingqiu: Oh no! The person they apprehended... was it by chance an editor named Onodera?
Media:vo rcjeq003 8 xingqiu 12.ogg Xingqiu: Everyone, it's too late to explain. We must make haste and rescue Onodera!
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 kujousara 01.ogg Kujou Sara: Oh, so you must be the author of A Legend of Sword. I didn't expect to see others tagging along with you.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 kujousara 02.ogg Kujou Sara: Yes, in fact, we were just getting ready to leave.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 kujousara 03.ogg Kujou Sara: Ahem! Well, to be precise, we had dispatched two additional squads here... In order to prevent the suspect from escaping.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 kuroda 01.ogg Kuroda: Onodera, I think you should explain the truth regarding the stolen books to the rest of the people on Ritou.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 onodera 01.ogg Onodera: No need to worry, Zhenyu! I've just explained everything to Madam Kujou, and Kuroda has testified for me.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 onodera 02.ogg Onodera: No, Zhenyu, it's only appropriate that I take responsibility for this. Everyone, please let me explain.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 onodera 03.ogg Onodera: For the Irodori Festival, I recommended the idea of selling newly released novels signed by the authors.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 onodera 04.ogg Onodera: Not only was this the first major project that I was in charge of since joining the Yae Publishing House, but Lady Yae also gave me a lot of support.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 onodera 05.ogg Onodera: However, I did not discuss our plans with the authors in advance. As a result, it caused a great deal of trouble for Zhenyu.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 onodera 06.ogg Onodera: Even though such an event would be difficult for Zhenyu, after telling him how important the plans were to me, he immediately boarded a ship to Inazuma to come up with a solution.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 onodera 07.ogg Onodera: So these past few days, Zhenyu has been actively practicing his handwriting. However, it takes time to sign each book, and we realized the time we reserved for the signing was not nearly enough.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 onodera 08.ogg Onodera: So I came up with the idea of moving the new books from the warehouse to my place. That way, Zhenyu could use these few days to sign them all.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 onodera 09.ogg Onodera: I thought everything would work out without a hitch... I never expected that someone would immediately realize that the books were missing from the warehouse.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 onodera 10.ogg Onodera: To make things worse, I was on vacation and staying with Zhenyu in my house these past few days... I had no idea that the situation had turned into such a huge mess.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 onodera 11.ogg Onodera: *sigh* All of this happened because I wanted to prove myself through this event.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 onodera 12.ogg Onodera: Yes, I understand. I'll apologize to everyone.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Xingqiu looks pretty flustered. What exactly is going on here?
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Yeah, that's right. All that matters is that Xingqiu and his books are okay.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We should probably be heading back to Ritou as well. Let's tag along.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 soilder 01.ogg Tenryou Commission Soldier: Heh...
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 venti 01.ogg Venti: Hey, c'mon you two, loosen up a little. The theft was nothing more than a simple misunderstanding. Besides, everyone has something they do not wish others to see.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 xingqiu 01.ogg Xingqiu: Please wait, Onodera is innocent!
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 xingqiu 02.ogg Xingqiu: Anyway, you mustn't take him away, I can explain everything...
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 xingqiu 03.ogg Xingqiu: Oh, whew... what a relief.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 xingqiu 04.ogg Xingqiu: Hmm, wait a minute! Does everyone else here already know?
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 xingqiu 05.ogg Xingqiu: Uh...
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 xingqiu 06.ogg Xingqiu: Ah, ahem... Though it's most embarrassing, it appears quite a few people are aware of the situation now. There's no use keeping it a secret...
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 xingqiu 07.ogg Xingqiu: In the end, I'm the one responsible for this whole predicament.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 xingqiu 08.ogg Xingqiu: Yes, to be frank, calligraphy is not my strong point, so signing events are really not my forte.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 xingqiu 09.ogg Xingqiu: Onodera, I agreed to your proposal because I didn't want the readers to know of my unsightly handwriting.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 xingqiu 10.ogg Xingqiu: Also, I knew that Onodera had been misled by one of my prior signatures.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 xingqiu 11.ogg Xingqiu: At a previous event, the Yae Publishing House had requested autographs of authors so they could be put on display.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 xingqiu 12.ogg Xingqiu: I practiced tirelessly for an entire day to finally deliver a stylish and elegant signature for the event.
Media:vo rcjeq003 9 xingqiu 13.ogg Xingqiu: But looking back on it now, I had dug myself into a hole by delivering that nice signature for the sake of my pride.
Onodera explains the situation to the editors.
Shimura Kanbei: A few days ago, a handsome young fellow came here to eat. From the way he dressed, he was probably from Liyue.
Shimura Kanbei: But when I asked him if he was here to take part in the Irodori Festival, he shifted his gaze away, and he tried to divert the conversation.
Shimura Kanbei: Indeed. But he dressed so well., I don't think he could have been some sort of troublemaker...
Shimura Kanbei: That's rather odd.
Xingqiu arrives shortly after, and everyone enjoys a leisurely meal. Afterward...
Xingqiu: All he knew was that
Xingqiu: He knew nothing
Xingqiu: Of this individual's true intentions
Xingqiu: That figure was none other than Aoi no Okina himself
Xingqiu: The poem had to do with an old acquaintance, Akahito
Xingqiu: This turn of events had begun with an unnamed individual
Xingqiu: To take drastic measures to retrieve a page of poetry
Xingqiu: Under whose coercion Aoi no Okina was forced
You explain all that has happened in the past few days...
You show Albedo the piece of paper found by Xingqiu...
