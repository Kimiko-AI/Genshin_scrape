 ...Why?
 Don't be sad.
 Don't take his Mora.
 Got it. No explosions.
 I'll cook them myself.
 Klee, are you saying you'd like to go and play?
 Let's go check out the Irodori Festival.
 Let's introduce her to someone interesting.
 Let's take her somewhere interesting.
 Like painting.
 Like writing a story.
 Miss me?
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 02b.ogg Albedo: Yes, indeed, I believe Klee has missed you tremendously.
 No explosions allowed.
 Ok, fine: Paimon, you are very thoughtful.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: Yeah, that's more like it.
 Quest Description"Today, me and Albedo arrived in a country where there's lots and lots of thunder. Albedo said that this place is called Inazuma... Inazuma... Klee thinks this name is pretty hard to write."
 She runs the fireworks shop.
 She's a superhero.
 Step Description"(Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight said that Dodoco could play with me in pictures, and that we can play however and whatever we like there, even fish blasting!""Yoimiya is bringing me to go draw a story. She'll draw and I'll color!♪""Klee's so happy right now, and Dodoco too!"
 Step Description"Albedo's busy right now and can't play with Klee.""Poor Albedo... Not being able to play must be such a bummer.""Later, I went with (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight and Paimon to go play.""I'll bring something fun back for Albedo. Let's hope he doesn't feel too sad."
 Step Description"Dodoco's story almost didn't get told, but then a nice lady with fluffy ears showed up.""She was super cool! She found a way to get Dodoco's story back.""Later, Yoimiya and I gave Dodoco's story to (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight, Paimon, and Albedo. Everyone was sooo happy, it was great!"
 Step Description"Klee found lots of tasty stuff, and Iwao too!(Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight treated us to super tasty Egg Rolls. (He's/She's) just the best!""Later, we went with Iwao to the fireworks shop and we met the super cool Yoimiya!"
 Step Description"Klee would love to go fish blasting with Yoimiya, but (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight said we couldn't, so I didn't.""But it's a shame we can't go fish blasting. Dodoco's sad too.""Yoimiya couldn't set off any fireworks either, so she was kinda sad too.""(Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight wanted to make us happy, so (he/she) invited us to go see the Irowdory Festival... Uh, Klee thinks she got that one right. Right?"
 Sure — and I'll throw in some for you too.
 Think of it like Dodoco playing with everybody.
 Unlike Paimon.
 We'll look after Klee.
 Well, that settles it. You're very thoughtful.
 What's up?
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 02a.ogg Albedo: Hehe, can't I come and see you when nothing is up?
 Yeah, the Irodori Festival is the perfect occasion for storytelling.
 Yeah, we'll find a way.
 You put me and Paimon in the story?
 You put me in the story?
 You should spend some time with Klee too, Albedo.
(open food inventory)
A while later.
Media:vo dialog rcjwq001 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Thank you for taking care of Klee.
Media:vo dialog rcjwq001 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: I heard lighting fires is strictly prohibited in both Ritou and Inazuma during the Irodori Festival. Please keep a close watch on her.
Media:vo dialog rcjwq001 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Klee's already run off. You'd better catch up with her.
Media:vo dialog rcjwq001 iwao 01a.ogg Media:vo dialog rcjwq001 iwao 01b.ogg Iwao: Hey (mister/ma'am), do you really know how to make Egg Rolls?
Media:vo dialog rcjwq001 iwao 02.ogg Iwao: If you're not confident in your cooking skills, you can always go buy them from Shimura Kanbei's shop instead. I promise I won't make fun of you for it.
Media:vo dialog rcjwq001 iwao 03.ogg Iwao: I still don't get why Yoimiya is upset...
Media:vo dialog rcjwq001 matsuzaka 01.ogg Matsuzaka: It's alright, I know Yoimiya's upset because she can't light any fireworks. You should go with her to the Irodori Festival.
Media:vo dialog rcjwq001 matsuzaka 02.ogg Matsuzaka: I'm gonna take my strongest Onikabuto and go beat that guy with the horns on his head in a beetle battle again. I'll cheer Yoimiya up in my own way.
Media:vo dialog rcjwq001 saika 01.ogg Saika: Ugh, dummy, Yoimiya is upset because she can't set off fireworks for everyone during the Irodori Festival.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: What a coincidence. I was wondering where I might be able to find you, and here you are.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 02a.ogg Albedo: Hehe, can't I come and see you when nothing is up?
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 02b.ogg Albedo: Yes, indeed, I believe Klee has missed you tremendously.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Alright, as much as I'd like to sit and chat with you, this time I'm here mainly for Klee.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: Before bringing Klee here, I told her many stories about Inazuma. It got her very excited to experience the local culture here.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: However, I've got other things to do in Inazuma this time besides painting the portraits of The Five Kasen. Over the next couple of days, I won't have the time to show her around.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: Inazuma is not like Mondstadt. I can't just let Klee wander off by herself when I'm busy with other things. So, I had to have her stay at the International Trade Association while I finish my work.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: She hasn't complained, but I can tell she's not enjoying being stuck there on her own.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: Fortunately, I now have you and Paimon. So...
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 09a.ogg Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 09b.ogg Albedo: Klee, do you wanna go play with (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight?
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: As you know, Klee is our Spark Knight. You must keep her safe and sound.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: Ahem... by which I mean, try to keep her out of trouble.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: For instance, if a mountain in Inazuma was to lose one if its peaks, or if there were an explosion somewhere in the city, Klee could very well get in trouble...
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 13.ogg Albedo: Glad to hear it.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 albedo 14.ogg Albedo: Great, I look forward to it.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 klee 01a.ogg Media:vo rcjwq001 1 klee 01b.ogg Klee: Yay, (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight's here!
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 klee 02a.ogg Media:vo rcjwq001 1 klee 02b.ogg Klee: Whatcha talkin' about, (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight? Are we gonna go play?
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 klee 03.ogg Klee: Yeah! ...Um, but Albedo is really busy. I can't go too far away, or he'll be worried about me.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 klee 04.ogg Klee: Yay! You bet I do!
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 klee 05.ogg Klee: I promise I'll bring you back an awesome souvenir, Mr. Albedo.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: ...Aw, Klee, you're such a thoughtful kid.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ah! Paimon's very thoughtful, thank you very much! Paimon always thinks of you whenever she's eating a delicious slime.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 paimon 03b.ogg Paimon: Yeah, that's more like it.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Anyway — it is pretty cruel not to let Klee go out when she was so excited to come here.
Media:vo rcjwq001 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Yup yup, allow the almighty (Traveler) and dependable Paimon to bring Klee on a tour of Inazuma.
Media:vo rcjwq001 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Here we are: the venue of the Irodori Festival.
Media:vo rcjwq001 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Look at all these stalls. It looks super fun, doesn't it?
Media:vo rcjwq001 12 kayabukikazukei 01.ogg Kayabuki Ikkei: Who's this "Kawabunga"? It's pronounced "Kayabuki Ikkei." Heh... that would be me.
Media:vo rcjwq001 12 kayabukikazukei 02.ogg Kayabuki Ikkei: Outlander Brigade is a new series of mine, and When the Wind of Death Blew Towards the Blond Samurai is the first volume.
Media:vo rcjwq001 12 kayabukikazukei 03.ogg Kayabuki Ikkei: Absolutely not. I would never allow such clichés in one of my novels.
Media:vo rcjwq001 12 kayabukikazukei 04.ogg Kayabuki Ikkei: This is a book about betrayal, blood, and tears! A long and lonely struggle! A stubborn samurai's path to the truth! This is the kind of story that needs to be told.
Media:vo rcjwq001 12 kayabukikazukei 05.ogg Kayabuki Ikkei: Hey, Miss, don't go! Are you sure you don't want a copy? I'll give you 40% off!
Media:vo rcjwq001 12 klee 01.ogg Klee: By... Kawabunga Icky. Yoimiya, this is a really strange name.
Media:vo rcjwq001 12 klee 02.ogg Klee: Outlander's Big... Raid... um, is it a story about the best of friends?
Media:vo rcjwq001 12 klee 03.ogg Klee: Kaeya says that every good story has to have best friends in it.
Media:vo rcjwq001 12 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: "Outlander Brigade: When the Wind of Death Blew Towards the Blond Samurai"...? What a long name... Must be a new one, I've never heard of it.
Media:vo rcjwq001 12 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: Oh... is that right? Well, I'm not sure that's a very suitable story for Klee. Um... we might keep looking around.
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 klee 01.ogg Klee: Flowers for Princess Fischl... Oh, look, it's Fischl's story.
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 klee 02.ogg Klee: Nope. But I know Fischl's story.
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 klee 03.ogg Klee: Fischl always hangs out with Oz. Everyone in the Adventurers' Guild knows, it's just like how me and Dodoco are always together.
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 klee 04.ogg Klee: I wonder if... Dodoco is getting bored now?
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 klee 05.ogg Klee: Mr. Albedo taught me how to paint! I can paint the story of Dodoco's adventure in Inazuma!
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 klee 06.ogg Klee: Yay, great! Dodoco will be so happy.
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 klee 07.ogg Klee: Yay! Let's go, let's go!
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Darn, it seems like even the Irodori Festival can't cheer Klee and Yoimiya up.
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmm... there must be plenty of things you can do with Dodoco besides lighting fireworks and going fish blasting.
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: That's right! The Irodori Festival is a place for putting your work on display. You could show Dodoco's story for everyone here...
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Bingo! What do you think of that idea, Klee?
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: That's right, Flowers for Princess Fischl. Have you read this book before, Klee?
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: Klee, I'm afraid it can't be helped. There are a lot of flammable items at the festival, and we have to be careful not to start a fire.
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: Yeah! Like, um... uh...
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 yoimiya 04.ogg Yoimiya: Wait, so that's what you're suggesting?
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 yoimiya 05.ogg Yoimiya: That's very imaginative. I think it's a great idea!
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 yoimiya 06.ogg Yoimiya: Hehe, we can even put the finished story on display at the festival.
Media:vo rcjwq001 13 yoimiya 07.ogg Yoimiya: Perfect. Okay, so I have some paper, paintbrushes, and paint at the shop. Let's go to the shop and paint your story there.
Media:vo rcjwq001 14 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Those two can run so fast when they're motivated. We'd better catch up!
Media:vo rcjwq001 15 klee 01.ogg Klee: We're gonna keep the content of this story a secret from you guys for now.
Media:vo rcjwq001 15 klee 02.ogg Klee: Come on, Yoimiya, we should get going. Let's go inside and start painting.
Media:vo rcjwq001 15 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Aww, Paimon was hoping that we could all paint together... So unfair!
Media:vo rcjwq001 15 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Heehee, actually, Paimon's got an idea! Come on, let's go around to the windows and take a sneaky peek.
Media:vo rcjwq001 15 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: (Traveler), Klee and I just had a discussion, and we've decided...
Media:vo rcjwq001 15 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: Ugh, obviously I can't tell you why, or... You'll see, don't worry.
Media:vo rcjwq001 15 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: You can keep exploring the festival while we're busy in the shop. We'll be here when you get back.
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 klee 01.ogg Klee: Um, Dodoco goes to eat Tri-Flavored Skewers, Tonkotsu Ramen, and Egg Rolls.
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 klee 02.ogg Klee: It's okay, Yoimiya, I have some Mora! Look!
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 klee 03a.ogg Media:vo rcjwq001 16 klee 03b.ogg Klee: (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight has helped a lot already. I don't wanna trouble (him/her).
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 klee 04.ogg Klee: So I think I should just go fish blasting to earn some Mora.
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 klee 05.ogg Klee: Oh... then we've got no choice. We'll have to go see Mr. Albedo.
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 klee 06.ogg Klee: He's my older brother. He's super-duper smart, he can do anything!
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 klee 07.ogg Klee: And he knows how to paint, too. He paints hilichurls, Kaeya, and even Dodoco. That's why he came to Inazuma this time, to do paintings for everyone.
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 klee 08.ogg Klee: An artist? Oh, that means he has two jobs... One as an alchemy-ist, teaching Sucrose alchemy, and the other as an artist, doing paintings for people.
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 klee 09.ogg Klee: Yoimiya, lemme show you something. Mr. Albedo taught me you can paint Dodoco's color like this...
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 klee 10.ogg Klee: Okay! Let's write this...
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Shoot, Paimon didn't hear the last part.
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Those two sound like they really did go on an adventure with Dodoco. They couldn't be happier.
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: So. What does Dodoco do after getting to Inazuma?
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: Ooh, that sounds great. Is that what you're painting? It looks beautiful!
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: Hmm, although it'll cost a lot of Mora to get it printed. Let me see if I've got enough saved up...
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 yoimiya 04.ogg Yoimiya: 50 Mora is probably not quite enough...
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 yoimiya 05.ogg Yoimiya: Well, if we don't have enough, we can ask (Traveler) for ideas.
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 yoimiya 06.ogg Yoimiya: No fish blasting! Paimon and (Traveler) said so.
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 yoimiya 07.ogg Yoimiya: Who's Mr. Albedo?
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 yoimiya 08.ogg Yoimiya: Is that right? Then I guess Mr. Albedo must be an artist working with the Yae Publishing House.
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 yoimiya 09.ogg Yoimiya: Wow, I can see the resemblance. Alright, I'll paint the streets, and Klee, you fill in Dodoco's colors.
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 yoimiya 10.ogg Yoimiya: ...Hey, you can even write the story over here to explain what's happening in the painting.
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 yoimiya 11.ogg Yoimiya: Oh...
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 yoimiya 12.ogg Yoimiya: Dodoco sure had a lot of fun in Inazuma!
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 yoimiya 13.ogg Yoimiya: Now we have to get Dodoco's story printed. C'mon, let's go to the Yae Publishing House.
Media:vo rcjwq001 16 yoimiya 14.ogg Yoimiya: Once you're done painting, let's go get it printed. We'll print a whole bunch of copies and go hand them out at the festival.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Combining the prints is a plausible solution, but it'll cause a lot of extra work for the printing press. I am terribly sorry about that.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Yoimiya, (Traveler), thank you for keeping Klee so exceptionally well entertained for me.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Yes, you're right. Klee is family, after all.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 aratani 01.ogg Aratani: Aunty? Who's that calling me Aunty? Oh, it's the little girl who came with Mr. Calx.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 aratani 02.ogg Aratani: How can I help you, little girl?
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 aratani 03.ogg Aratani: Dodoco? Oh, so you've been writing a story, huh? Is Dodoco the main character?
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 aratani 04.ogg Aratani: Huh, I don't quite understand...
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 aratani 05.ogg Aratani: Oh, I see. I'd love to help you make this wish come true, but I'm sorry...
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 aratani 06.ogg Aratani: The deadline has passed for accepting printing orders for the Irodori Festival.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 aratani 07.ogg Aratani: I'm sorry, little girl.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 aratani 08.ogg Aratani: Miss Yoimiya, I understand your sentiment, but I'm afraid it's not as simple as that.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 aratani 09.ogg Aratani: We've been printing many people's personal works for this festival, and a lot of the books are already well behind schedule. The printing press is already working overtime to try and catch up.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 aratani 10.ogg Aratani: At a time like this, we really can't squeeze any more jobs in.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 aratani 11.ogg Aratani: Oh, Lady Yae...
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 aratani 12.ogg Aratani: Yes, Lady Yae. I'll get right on it!
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 klee 01.ogg Klee: Yae Publishing House... Ooh, it's Aunty Aratani! I know Aunty Aratani!
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 klee 02.ogg Klee: Aunty Aratani, can you help me get Dodoco's story printed so that everybody can see it?
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 klee 03.ogg Klee: Aunty, are you saying Dodoco won't be able to meet everyone after all?
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 klee 04.ogg Klee: *sobbing*
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 klee 05.ogg Klee: Yep, I am! Thanks, Miss Guuji Lady!
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We'd better explain this to her.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: What do we do? Seems like we might have to give up on this idea...
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: It's Miko! And Albedo too!
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yaemiko 01.ogg Yae Miko: My, my. Yoimiya has quite a determined spirit. I like it very much.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yaemiko 02.ogg Yae Miko: We heard everything.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yaemiko 03.ogg Yae Miko: It's okay, I know. You were just following the rules. Plus, we really are quite behind schedule with the printing.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yaemiko 04.ogg Yae Miko: But our mission at Yae Publishing House is to brings dreams and happiness to the masses. It would be a crying shame if we couldn't even help one adorable little girl fulfill her wish.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yaemiko 05.ogg Yae Miko: Let me think... Oh, I know!
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yaemiko 06.ogg Yae Miko: Yoimiya, little girl, you can print your book, but on one condition. Okay?
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yaemiko 07.ogg Yae Miko: Dear me, it's nothing that horrendous. You make it sound like I'm some sort of wicked witch.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yaemiko 08.ogg Yae Miko: All I mean is, if you want to get your work printed now, there is only one way: You have to combine it with another print.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yaemiko 09.ogg Yae Miko: However, there is only a small amount of space remaining in the book in question. Your book is too big, so you have to reduce it to about half the size to make it fit.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yaemiko 10.ogg Yae Miko: Is this a sacrifice that you are willing to make?
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yaemiko 11.ogg Yae Miko: Hehe, what an adorable little girl. Well, that settles it. Aratani, make sure it gets printed with tonight's batch!
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yaemiko 12.ogg Yae Miko: No problem. Just think of it as my greeting gift for little Klee.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yaemiko 13.ogg Yae Miko: Besides, the Yae Publishing House will need your help with the illustrations again next time, Mr. Calx. You could also consider it as my investment in you.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yaemiko 14.ogg Yae Miko: Alright, I won't disturb you two any longer. Bye-bye, now.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: Here we are. This is the Yae Publishing House.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: Not only that, Dodoco is also real. Look!
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: Aw Klee, don't be upset. You still have me and (Traveler). We'll think of something!
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yoimiya 04.ogg Yoimiya: Um, Miss Aratani, is there any way at all we can still get this printed?
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yoimiya 05.ogg Yoimiya: We can pay extra! And if you're short on staff to help with the printing, I can pitch in!
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yoimiya 06.ogg Yoimiya: No, I won't let that happen.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yoimiya 07.ogg Yoimiya: I remember this one time when I was little, pops said he'd take me to the festival, but he was so busy with work that he forgot all about it.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yoimiya 08.ogg Yoimiya: I waited and waited, and kept wondering when pops was finally gonna take me there. Eventually, people started coming home from the festival...
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yoimiya 09.ogg Yoimiya: That night, I cried miserably. To this day, I still remember how sad I felt. I don't want Klee to feel the same way.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yoimiya 10.ogg Yoimiya: If we can't get it printed, then we'll just have to find our own way!
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yoimiya 11.ogg Yoimiya: I can paint. Over the next few days, I'll paint as many as I can, then we'll take those to the festival!
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yoimiya 12.ogg Yoimiya: Of course, Lady Guuji. Just tell us. Whatever this condition is, I am ready to face it.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yoimiya 13.ogg Yoimiya: Klee, Lady Guuji is saying that we can print the book if we shrink it to half the size. Are you okay with that?
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yoimiya 14.ogg Yoimiya: Yay! Everything worked out perfectly. Now we just need to wait for an update from the Yae Publishing House.
Media:vo rcjwq001 17 yoimiya 15.ogg Yoimiya: Hehe, no worries!
Media:vo rcjwq001 18 aratani 01.ogg Aratani: Lady Yae wanted me to inform you that since this book was printed together with another work, there are many more copies than you may have anticipated.
Media:vo rcjwq001 18 aratani 02.ogg Aratani: We won't charge you a printing fee, but in exchange, the extra copies of your book will be included as a free gift with purchases of the other book. Is that okay with you?
Media:vo rcjwq001 18 aratani 03.ogg Aratani: Actually, the book that yours was printed with is called the "Teyvat Travel Guide."
Media:vo rcjwq001 18 aratani 04.ogg Aratani: Klee's mother, Alice, is a renowned adventurer in Teyvat, and the Inazuma Edition of her popular "Teyvat Travel Guide" series is set to be released imminently.
Media:vo rcjwq001 18 aratani 05.ogg Aratani: Lady Yae has already decided on how to promote it: "A joint endeavor by Teyvat's biggest and best mother-daughter adventure duo." It's sure to be a huge hit.

Media:vo rcjwq001 18 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: It's really nothing that exciting.
Media:vo rcjwq001 18 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: And me...
Media:vo rcjwq001 18 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: And you guys.
Media:vo rcjwq001 18 yoimiya 04.ogg Yoimiya: Of course we included Paimon. This is the story of everyone's big, happy adventure with Dodoco.
Media:vo rcjwq001 18 yoimiya 05.ogg Yoimiya: Oh, are you sure? It's fine by us, but what does the author of the book think...
Media:vo rcjwq001 18 yoimiya 06.ogg Yoimiya: So Klee's mother is a writer? Huh.
Media:vo rcjwq001 18 yoimiya 07.ogg Yoimiya: Hehe, a typical move by Lady Yae. It works out well for everybody, doesn't it?
Media:vo rcjwq001 3 klee 01.ogg Klee: "Cuisine"? What's that?
Media:vo rcjwq001 3 klee 02.ogg Klee: A restaurant! Yay! Snack time!
Media:vo rcjwq001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: There are loads of cool things to do in Inazuma. Try the local cuisine, visit a shrine... What do you wanna do, Klee?
Media:vo rcjwq001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Y'know, food and drink. Paimon just meant we could take you to a local restaurant.
Media:vo rcjwq001 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Got it! Alright, snack time it is! Let's go.
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 iwao 01.ogg Iwao: It's not "noodley soup." It's "Tonkotsu Ramen," actually.
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 iwao 02.ogg Iwao: You're kidding, right? Those are Tri-Flavored Skewers.
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 iwao 03.ogg Iwao: That's an Egg Roll. They're amazing. Have you really not tried one before?
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 iwao 04.ogg Iwao: Hehehe, they sure are. Guess you're not from around here if you haven't tried any of these before.
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 iwao 05.ogg Iwao: Lemme buy you an Egg Roll with my allowance so you can get a taste of our Inazuman food.
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 iwao 06.ogg Iwao: Ohh... I remember you, you're Yoimiya's friend. How come you know how to make Egg Rolls?
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 klee 01.ogg Klee: Wow, something smells so good... I think it's coming from this steaming thingy.
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 klee 02a.ogg Media:vo rcjwq001 4 klee 02b.ogg Klee: (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight, look at this noodley soup, it's so pretty! There's so many nice things inside.
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 klee 03.ogg Klee: Oh... so, um, what are those yellow-and-red thingies on that plate?
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 klee 04.ogg Klee: And what about this little yellow cake?
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 klee 05.ogg Klee: Wow, Tonkotsu Ramen, Tri-Flavored Skewers, and Egg Rolls... They all sound delicious.
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 klee 06.ogg Klee: Really? But Master Jean said I shouldn't go taking other people's things.
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Also, that's your allowance, right? Taking another kid's allowance just seems kinda wrong...
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 paimon 02a.ogg Media:vo rcjwq001 4 paimon 02b.ogg Paimon: Egg Rolls are a piece of cake for (Traveler). Why don't you make some for Klee and Iwao?
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: R—Really? Wow, Paimon is so touched. You're learning, (Traveler).
Media:vo rcjwq001 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Alright, we'll be waiting on those Egg Rolls.
Media:vo rcjwq001 6 klee 01a.ogg Media:vo rcjwq001 6 klee 01b.ogg Klee: (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight, what do Egg Rolls taste like?

Media:vo rcjwq001 7 iwao 02.ogg Iwao: Yeah, these Egg Rolls are pretty good... but I still think Yoimiya's are better.
Media:vo rcjwq001 7 iwao 03.ogg Iwao: Yoimiya can do anything! She tells stories, keeps goldfish, makes fireworks, and gives us candy, too.
Media:vo rcjwq001 7 iwao 04.ogg Iwao: Yoimiya's pretty much the best and most awesome person ever.
Media:vo rcjwq001 7 iwao 05.ogg Iwao: Oh... well, I don't know any of those people. But anyways, I still wanna introduce you to Yoimiya. If you want, I'll take you to find her.
Media:vo rcjwq001 7 iwao 06.ogg Iwao: In most festivals, Yoimiya's so busy that you can never find her. But this festival's different — she has free time, so she can play with us.
Media:vo rcjwq001 7 iwao 07.ogg Iwao: She seems like she hasn't been in a great mood recently, but maybe seeing you will cheer her up.
Media:vo rcjwq001 7 klee 01.ogg Klee: Mmm... it's sweet... so yummy!
Media:vo rcjwq001 7 klee 02.ogg Klee: Who is Yoimiya? She makes Egg Rolls, too?
Media:vo rcjwq001 7 klee 03a.ogg Media:vo rcjwq001 7 klee 03b.ogg Klee: For me, the best and most awesome person in the world is my mom! And Klee knows loads of other great people, too, like Mr. Albedo, (Mr./Miss) Honorary Knight, Master Jean, Kaeya...
Media:vo rcjwq001 7 klee 04.ogg Klee: Okay, let's go play with Yoimiya.
Media:vo rcjwq001 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: ...Yup yup, it's delicious... (Traveler), you are the best.
Media:vo rcjwq001 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Surely she's not going to name everyone she knows...?
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 iwao 01.ogg Iwao: Yoimiya, it's me!
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 iwao 02.ogg Iwao: I wanna introduce you to a new friend. An outlander girl, I just met her... Wait, what's your name again?
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 klee 01.ogg Klee: Klee, my name is Klee.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 klee 02.ogg Klee: Um... hello...
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 klee 03.ogg Klee: That's a four-leaf clover. Mom and Master Jean said it can bring me good luck.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 klee 04.ogg Klee: That's Dodoco, my best friend. We always go fish blasting together in Starfell Lake.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 klee 05.ogg Klee: Yep. My mom says that when a Dodoco is born, it rides the wind and goes off on a big adventure.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 klee 06.ogg Klee: Yep! My mom is the best and most awesome person ever.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 klee 07.ogg Klee: And, Yoimiya, Iwao was right. You're a really cool person, too.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 klee 08.ogg Klee: Yeah! And after the fireworks, we can go fish blasting with Dodoco.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 klee 09.ogg Klee: What? It's not allowed? But, awww... okay then.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 klee 10.ogg Klee: Okay then, let's go!
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 matsuzaka 01.ogg Matsuzaka: Yoimiya, don't be sad. Um... I... oh, I know, lemme tell you something that'll cheer you up!
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 matsuzaka 02.ogg Matsuzaka: Yesterday, I won three beetle fights in a row against that guy with the horns on his head!
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's so heartwarming watching these two chat away.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh, hold on a second, fish blasting? No way, Albedo was pretty clear about that.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Hey, come on, you just made a new friend, this is a happy occasion. Why are you suddenly so upset?
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Yeah, we still have loads of things we can do!
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Right. Just like Saika said, there are lots of fun things to do.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 saika 01.ogg Saika: Don't worry, Yoimiya, maybe you can't light fireworks during the Irodori Festival, but there are still lots of other fun things to do!
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 yoimiya 01.ogg Yoimiya: Wow, Matsuzaka, nice work! It's not easy to beat Itto...
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 yoimiya 02.ogg Yoimiya: I know... Thanks, you guys, it's just that fireworks are banned in the city for a few days. I'm not that upset, really.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 yoimiya 03.ogg Yoimiya: Nice to meet you, Klee. I'm Yoimiya, and I run Naganohara Fireworks.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 yoimiya 04.ogg Yoimiya: I love the cute outfit, with the hat, and that cool little symbol, so unique. And your backpack — wow, it's really well-made.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 yoimiya 05.ogg Yoimiya: Really? That's awesome. I bet everyone would love one of those.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 yoimiya 06.ogg Yoimiya: Also, that little fairy on your backpack is super cute, too.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 yoimiya 07.ogg Yoimiya: Oh, Dodoco? What an interesting name. I really like it.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 yoimiya 08.ogg Yoimiya: "Ride the wind and go off on a big adventure." Klee, your mom sounds like a very cool person.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 yoimiya 09.ogg Yoimiya: Hehe, thanks, Klee, I feel like we really get each other. We'll be great friends, I'm sure of it.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 yoimiya 10.ogg Yoimiya: Hey, Klee, since you like four-leaf clovers so much, why don't I make a firework with a four-leaf clover pattern and set it off for you?
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 yoimiya 11.ogg Yoimiya: Oops. I got so excited that I completely forgot about that.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 yoimiya 12.ogg Yoimiya: The folks from the Yashiro Commission specifically warned me that no fireworks are allowed in Inazuma during the Irodori Festival.
Media:vo rcjwq001 8 yoimiya 13.ogg Yoimiya: What do you say, Klee? Sounds like the Irodori Festival could be a real blast!
