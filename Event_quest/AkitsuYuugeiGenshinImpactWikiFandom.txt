 Quest DescriptionBoth Ei and Heizou mentioned this mysterious game. Go to the beach and check it out.
Paimon: Akitsu Yuugei... Both Ei and Heizou mentioned that game before. Shall we check it out?
Paimon: Paimon doesn't really see anyone here though... Heizou said that we can start the game by talking to the Bulletin Board, so Paimon thinks we should try that.
Paimon: This should be where people play Akitsu Yuugei. This place seems to be opening back up, just like Ei said.
Paimon: We should still be careful though. Paimon really doesn't want to be trapped here!
