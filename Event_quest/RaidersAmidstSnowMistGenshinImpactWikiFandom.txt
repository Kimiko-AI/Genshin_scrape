 (...?)
 (Huh. Is that how it went?)
 (Is he implying something?)
 (Quite reluctant to let people in on the matter of this sword, isn't he?)
 A power-absorbing sword must be quite dangerous.
 After all, you've put a lot of effort into your drawings.
 Ah, hilichurls!
 Albedo is keeping Cyrus in the dark.
 Albedo's also praised your smarts, Paimon.
 Are you making those strange noises, Albedo?
Media:vo eqxs003 3 albedo 06a.ogg Albedo: Do you really think that's possible?
 Are you making those strange noises, Paimon?
Media:vo eqxs003 3 paimon 05b.ogg Paimon: What do you think? And why aren't you asking Albedo, huh?
 Aren't Fatui a bigger threat?
 Aren't Treasure hoarders a bigger threat?
 Did it run in there?
 Did it want to learn alchemy too?
 Fortunately, you knew how to piece it back together.
 Great idea — I have some questions.
Media:vo eqxs003 3 albedo 03b 1.ogg Albedo: ...
Media:vo eqxs003 3 albedo 03b 2.ogg Albedo: Alright. What would you like to ask?
 He isn't interested in adventures in the slightest, is he?
 How does a rest and leisurely talk sound?
Media:vo eqxs003 3 albedo 03a.ogg Albedo: Just what I was thinking.
 I don't think Paimon has the same problem.
 I don't think so.
 I'll lend you a hand.
 If that happened to me, I'd get mad!
 Isn't that sketchbook very important to you?
 More carefree than I expected, for sure.
 More earnest than I expected, for sure.
 Now, where have we seen this face before?
 Paimon didn't mean anything bad...
 Paimon forgets about the little things, too?
 Paimon was just joking...
 Perhaps it dreams of becoming a grand-master artist someday?
 Quest DescriptionAll proceeds smoothly. You plan to search for Albedo to discuss the changes the sword has undergone further.All proceeds smoothly... and then, an accident occurs — some thief has stolen something dear to Albedo! To reclaim the stolen object, you and your companions give chase...
 Should I not ask?
 Such mementos shouldn't be easily abandoned.
 The hilichurls in this area are strong.
 Think of all the memories you've commited to paper.
 Ultra demon snowman hilichurls!
 Ultra hilichurls!
 Unusual ones?
 What's up, Cyrus?
 Yes, and a familiar one at that.
 You sure love your research, don't you?
Media:vo dialog eqxs003 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: We must get the book back, it has my notes and sketches in it.
Media:vo dialog eqxs003 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: The paths we may venture are not limited to those the eye can see.
Media:vo eqxs003 1 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Cyrus, to the point, please.
Media:vo eqxs003 1 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Mm, yes.
Media:vo eqxs003 1 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Oh yes, go on.
Media:vo eqxs003 1 albedo 04a.ogg Media:vo eqxs003 1 albedo 04b.ogg Albedo: I came here to gather the latest data on hilichurls, and asked (him/her) to serve as my assistant.
Media:vo eqxs003 1 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: I am listening, you know...
Media:vo eqxs003 1 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: There is no "should" or "shouldn't" here. I can answer your questions...
Media:vo eqxs003 1 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: But not right now. Right now, I have more pressing matters on hand.
Media:vo eqxs003 1 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: Hehe. You're getting smarter, Paimon.
Media:vo eqxs003 1 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: I have discovered new habitats with different monster types. I believe they will provide us with similarly varied data.
Media:vo eqxs003 1 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: Perseverance is key to research, and persistence is the basis of the alchemist's art.
Media:vo eqxs003 1 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: So, are you ready? Then let us go.
Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Yes, perhaps it is too soon to ask our greenhorns to come adventuring here...
Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 02.ogg Cyrus: But adventuring is nothing if it is not about pushing our limits! What is a journey without struggle, without excitement?
Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 03.ogg Cyrus: This place may be infested with wicked hilichurl bandits and knee-deep snow, but an adventurer must never stop pressing forward!
Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 04.ogg Cyrus: Hahaha! Come, come! The beauty of a chat lies in the journey, not the destination — just like an adventure!
Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 05.ogg Cyrus: Even if you are robbed blind and must give up on your encampment, you can start a fire and cook a meal in the frigid snow!
Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 06.ogg Cyrus: This journey up the mountain will be an unforgettable one for all our newcomers!
Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 07.ogg Cyrus: They may resent me, or even hate me. But in the future, they will think back upon this moment with their hearts filled with gratitude — for this was the day that the spirit of adventure was passed on to them!
Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 08.ogg Cyrus: Still... Should we say that our newcomers are too green, or that mountain is too mighty? We have taken great losses this time...
Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 09.ogg Cyrus: Oh, you must be...
Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 10a.ogg Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 10b.ogg Cyrus: Ah, yes. The young adventurer and (his/her) companion! It is my pleasure to see you here.
Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 11.ogg Cyrus: I trust these frigid ascents have not given you too much trouble?
Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 12.ogg Cyrus: Hahaha! Good, good. I love your confidence!
Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 13.ogg Cyrus: But you must be here on some important duty, braving the wind and snow like this.
Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 14.ogg Cyrus: Ah, I see. A gathering of people chasing their dreams and ideals, is it?
Media:vo eqxs003 1 cyrus 15.ogg Cyrus: Then I wish you all the best. Farewell for now — I must go to see our new recruits.
Media:vo eqxs003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Albedo! We're back~!
Media:vo eqxs003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, hey, does he have a guest over?
Media:vo eqxs003 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh brother... Albedo's back at it again. He's always so cold when the topic doesn't catch his fancy...
Media:vo eqxs003 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: He sure is interested in you, though.
Media:vo eqxs003 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: What? What do you mean, "great losses"?
Media:vo eqxs003 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Long time no see—!
Media:vo eqxs003 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Hah, we can take anything it has to throw at us!
Media:vo eqxs003 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Haha, looks like we've made a new discovery!
Media:vo eqxs003 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Well, it is a magical sword after all. It's understandable that he doesn't want other people to know about it.
Media:vo eqxs003 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: "Pressing matters"? Let Paimon guess, we've got a part to play in it too, huh?
Media:vo eqxs003 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Hey! Paimon will have you know that she's always been smart!
Media:vo eqxs003 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, looks like there's a camp over there.
Media:vo eqxs003 11 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: There's so many of them! Are they trying to surround us?
Media:vo eqxs003 11 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: These guys are pretty smart... Is this also the influence of Durin's body?
Media:vo eqxs003 12 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Ugh, there's been some damage...
Media:vo eqxs003 12 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: I need to head back to see if there's anything I can salvage. Let's meet at the alchemy stall in Mondstadt later, shall we?
Media:vo eqxs003 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: And that's our sketchbook — and it was on the head honcho, as expected!
Media:vo eqxs003 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wow, Albedo looked like he was in quite a hurry. Guess those who can't appreciate art shouldn't be able to handle it, huh!
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: It's alright. A few pages were destroyed, but most of it is intact.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: The temperature in the Snowy Mountain is subzero. It can reach extremely low temperatures, especially near that cavern.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: What makes matters worse is that the hilichurls have drooled all over the pages. To leave wet paper in such low temperatures, it's too dreadful to imagine...
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: What leads you to believe that?
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: I must admit, I bring this sketchbook everywhere I go.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: However, I wouldn't fly into a rage over such a thing.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: Had I not been able to salvage it, I would just draw everything again.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: Is that so?
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: Hmm... You're right. Redrawing everything would be a tedious endeavour.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: Without a doubt, Paimon is an interesting creature.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: Changing the subject... Cyrus told me that the hilichurls from this mountain attack and rob adventurers.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: The place we visited should should be one of their camps.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 13.ogg Albedo: I can't disagree. I assume... this must be related to the dragon.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 14.ogg Albedo: The corruptive power emanating from Durin's remains is making the monsters stronger, which, in tandem with the frigid climate, depopulated some mountain areas.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 15.ogg Albedo: Can you take out the sword, Traveler?
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 16.ogg Albedo: Each time you fought in the mountains, this sword was absorbing power and storing it within itself.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 17.ogg Albedo: Moreover, thanks to your purification, the corruptive power of the dragon's blood seems to be all gone now.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 18.ogg Albedo: It's a very interesting phenomenon.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 19.ogg Albedo: I always wondered what purification was capable of... I knew you were capable of doing it, but seeing it with my own eyes is a unique experience.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 20.ogg Albedo: Indeed, I can't say it's the safest of weapons.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 21.ogg Albedo: ...
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 22.ogg Albedo: Would you like to try it out?
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 23.ogg Albedo: It's fine. After all, I still hope you'll continue to use this sword.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 24.ogg Albedo: I have no idea what you're talking about...
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 25.ogg Albedo: But if you want to know why I trust you... It might be because...
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 26.ogg Albedo: The "unusual" ones like us share a certain degree of understanding.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 albedo 27.ogg Albedo: Lonely individuals... Those who aren't like ordinary people. Just like... you and me.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Albedo, how's the sketchbook situation?
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Frozen paper is so brittle. It doesn't take much for it to fall apart, huh?
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: No wonder you're an alchemist! Such an ingenious mind!
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: If the sketchbook had been severely damaged, you'd be furious, wouldn't you?
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: You told us there's a lot of drawings and notes inside.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Eh... How pragmatic of you...
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: That's right!
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Yep yep!
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Absolutely! Well said. You took the words out of Paimon's mouth, (Traveler).
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Especially since you're so talented, right?
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: You've mastered so many skills and gathered so much knowledge that other people can only dream of!
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: But such talented people sometimes forget about that. It's one of the downsides of being smart, isn't it?
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Ahhhh! Don't put Paimon on the spot when it comes to wisdom!
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Yea, the hilichurls here are way stronger than the ones at the bottom of the mountain.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: It's not the first time we've done something like that. We're experts!
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Lucky that it wasn't snatched away by those hilichurls, otherwise we'd be done for!
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Hilichurls are a threat, too! What if that power could turn them into... super, no, ultra hilichurls!
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: Ultra demon hilichurls!
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: "Snowman"? Now you've ruined the game...
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: Anyway, about the sword... If it's so powerful, can't it absorb your energy as well, Albedo?
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 21.ogg Paimon: Yikes! Such a cold gaze!
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 22.ogg Paimon: You still trust us? Even though this sword is so dangerous? Well that was unexpected.
Media:vo eqxs003 13 paimon 23.ogg Paimon: Albedo, you say one thing but do another... Paimon can never tell what's really on your mind!
Media:vo eqxs003 3 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Hmm. It seems that no one is here.
Media:vo eqxs003 3 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Well then, would you like to take a look around before they return, or shall we rest a while here?
Media:vo eqxs003 3 albedo 03a.ogg Albedo: Just what I was thinking.
Media:vo eqxs003 3 albedo 03b 1.ogg Albedo: ...
Media:vo eqxs003 3 albedo 03b 2.ogg Albedo: Alright. What would you like to ask?
Media:vo eqxs003 3 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: I know you must have questions, whether it be about me, or this entire situation. As I said before, I will answer them.
Media:vo eqxs003 3 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: But I will not deceive you. There are some things I cannot go into detail on. On these matters, you'll have to permit me to summarize a bit.
Media:vo eqxs003 3 albedo 06a.ogg Albedo: Do you really think that's possible?
Media:vo eqxs003 3 hilichurls 01.ogg ???: Tiga plata!
Media:vo eqxs003 3 hilichurls 02.ogg ???: Odomu Movo!
Media:vo eqxs003 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Do monsters go out to run errands too?
Media:vo eqxs003 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: So, we're having a chat now? Paimon wants in!
Media:vo eqxs003 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Huh. Guess Albedo can be pretty straightforward when he wants to be...
Media:vo eqxs003 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Uh huh! ...Eh, what?
Media:vo eqxs003 3 paimon 05b.ogg Paimon: What do you think? And why aren't you asking Albedo, huh?
Media:vo eqxs003 5 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: That's... not good. That was my sketchbook.
Media:vo eqxs003 5 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: To think that it dared to steal my sketchbook. Quite bold, this one.
Media:vo eqxs003 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: What is it doing here?
Media:vo eqxs003 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Ah! It's running off, and there's something in its hands!
Media:vo eqxs003 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Did you see that? That hilichurl ran off while holding on to something that looks like a book!
Media:vo eqxs003 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Paimon thinks it's just your run-of-the-mill thief, really.
Media:vo eqxs003 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Hmmm, looks like Albedo's got a frosty temper...
Media:vo eqxs003 7 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Judging from the tracks, that seems to be the case.
Media:vo eqxs003 7 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Wait.
Media:vo eqxs003 7 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: This mountain is incredibly large. Even if there was a path within its bowels, such a road would not be easy to walk.
Media:vo eqxs003 7 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: ...
Media:vo eqxs003 7 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: Can you feel it? The wind carries the scent of ice and stone with it... and the sound of echoes. The space within must be massive.
Media:vo eqxs003 7 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: As such, rash moves are of no benefit to us.
Media:vo eqxs003 7 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: It is. But that doesn't mean that we should act recklessly.
Media:vo eqxs003 7 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: There is another way. It just requires some extra work.
Media:vo eqxs003 7 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: If my guess is correct, this cavern's exit is on the other side of the mountain.
Media:vo eqxs003 7 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: You are quite the expert glider, and I'm quite the hand myself. So prepare yourself, and we'll glide across in one go.
Media:vo eqxs003 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We gotta hurry up, before it gets too far away!
Media:vo eqxs003 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Looks like it's a dead end. You know, except for this huge cavern entrance.
Media:vo eqxs003 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Then what are we waiting for!? We can't let it escape!
Media:vo eqxs003 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: R—Really?
Media:vo eqxs003 7 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: But... But we've come all this way — we can't just let it leave!
