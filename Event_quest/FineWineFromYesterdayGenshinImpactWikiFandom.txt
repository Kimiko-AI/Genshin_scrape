 Actually, we just started...
 He must have enjoyed it.
 I wouldn't be so sure.
 I'm sure your father thought it was a good drink.
 It's a new experience.
 It's been a little hectic.
 Quest Description"Just now, I saw Master Diluc enter the tavern in a rush.""Oh? Is Master Diluc going to mix drinks personally today? Can't miss out on this one... Come on, help me up."
 Sure, I'll get that started for you.
Another familiar face has arrived at the tavern.
Media:Vo eqtj002 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh, this doesn't look like the drink they ordered. Just give this one to Paimon and try making another.
Media:vo eqtj003 1 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Heh, me? "Nothing to do"? Don't count on it. I heard you two were working as bartenders, so I thought I'd drop by to see how you're coming along.
Media:vo eqtj003 1 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: So, tell me, (Traveler). How do you like being a bartender?
Media:vo eqtj003 1 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: Just tell me your initial feelings.
Media:vo eqtj003 1 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: Excited? Confused? Anything. How does it feel to be a bartender?
Media:vo eqtj003 1 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: I see.
Media:vo eqtj003 1 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: ...
Media:vo eqtj003 1 diluc 07.ogg Diluc: Good. I'm happy for you.
Media:vo eqtj003 1 diluc 08.ogg Diluc: Now, could you make me a Gray Valley Sunset, then? I'll leave the size up to you.
Media:vo eqtj003 1 diluc 09.ogg Diluc: Great, take your time.
Media:vo eqtj003 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh, it's Master Diluc! What brings you here? Do you have nothing to do today?
Media:vo eqtj003 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wow, you really do catch wind of things quickly!
Media:vo eqtj003 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yeah, it's still a little too early to tell. We haven't been at it for very long.
Media:vo eqtj003 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hey, didn't you want to ask Paimon, too?
Media:vo eqtj003 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Paimon's initial feeling is... drinks taste good!
Media:vo eqtj003 2 diluc 01.ogg Diluc: Mmm. Not bad, not bad at all.
Media:vo eqtj003 2 diluc 02.ogg Diluc: Sounds like I should thank the soil of Mondstadt.
Media:vo eqtj003 2 diluc 03.ogg Diluc: It just so happens that Gray Valley Sunset is the first drink I ever mixed.
Media:vo eqtj003 2 diluc 04.ogg Diluc: I was still quite young. My father laid out several ingredients and told me to experiment with them.
Media:vo eqtj003 2 diluc 05.ogg Diluc: No requirements and no instruction. In hindsight, he probably just wanted to test my creativity.
Media:vo eqtj003 2 diluc 06.ogg Diluc: In the end, I just made a glass of fruit punch, much like this one.
Media:vo eqtj003 2 diluc 07.ogg Diluc: My father was equally surprised. I didn't really put much thought into it, I just figured that it would taste sweet.
Media:vo eqtj003 2 diluc 08.ogg Diluc: Looking back on it, I was so young and naive.
Media:vo eqtj003 2 diluc 09.ogg Diluc: Oh?
Media:vo eqtj003 2 diluc 10.ogg Diluc: I've never thought about it, I suppose... My father didn't say a word at the time.
Media:vo eqtj003 2 diluc 11.ogg Diluc: But, thank you.
Media:vo eqtj003 2 diluc 12.ogg Diluc: By the way, there's something I'd like to give you.
Media:vo eqtj003 2 diluc 13.ogg Diluc: But, I suppose it's better to wait until you have more experience with your bartender job. I have no doubt that you'll do very well.
Media:vo eqtj003 2 diluc 14.ogg Diluc: Very well. Then, I look forward to seeing your good work. See you around.
Media:vo eqtj003 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: It's all about the ingredients! If the fruit are fresh and juicy, then the drink will naturally be sweet and tasty without adding anything extra.
Media:vo eqtj003 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh? But why fruit punch?
Media:vo eqtj003 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: And Paimon will... uh, be rooting for you! Hehe.
Media:vo eqtj003 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Come back soon when you have a minute!
Traveler: (Alright, this drink is looking good.)
