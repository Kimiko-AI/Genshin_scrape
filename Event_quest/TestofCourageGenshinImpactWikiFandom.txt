Behold these awesome horns, the suave smile, and the rich, velvety voice! That's the leader of the Arataki Gang for you!
Whether spinning tops, kendama, bug-fighting, or cards, all the kids' games...

How's that? Cool, huh? So, wanna join the crew?

Kamisato Ayato - Pillar of Fortitude
The young but accomplished clan head of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, Kamisato Ayato, is gentle and polite in his manners, and is a highly capable operator.
On the surface, he seems like a down-to-earth, elegant, and proper fellow who does not enjoy public appearances or showing off.
But those who know him well know never to underestimate him — for it was he who steadied the Kamisato Clan ship when the previous Commissioner had fallen gravely ill.
His present position is not one that could have been secured without extraordinary skills or brilliance. So, beware his immaculate smile all the same.

Once, she sequestered herself away in her Plane of Euthymia, seeking to fulfill her promise to her people of an unchanging eternity, leaving her puppet Shogun to enact the plan in her place.
But she has broken with this cycle after witnessing the desires of her people and taking up the dream of one she once knew, and now walks amongst mortals once more.
Where will the new Eternity she sees lead Inazuma now?

Shikanoin Heizou - Analytical Harmony
A young detective working at the Tenryou Commission who appears well-behaved and polite, but actually thumbs his nose at all the official mumbo jumbo.
As someone with extensive experience in solving crimes, Heizou is always the first one the head of the Police Station turns to whenever there is an unusually complicated case.
However, according to the young detective himself, his true trump card has never been experience, but intuition.
No wonder he always wears a confident smile on his face — that's what we call the ease of a genius.
 ...
 And who spoke strangely.
 But wouldn't it be more dangerous to stay here alone?
 C'mon, wake up.
 Calm down.
 Certainly seems that way.
 Genius.
 He was very subtle...
Media:vo sdeq001 45 itto 02a 1.ogg Arataki Itto: What? No way! Listen, every time I made my move, I scared the living daylights out of everyone!
 He's just pulling your leg.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 15b 1.ogg Paimon: Heh, Paimon thought so, too... Well, in that case, there's nothing to be scared of!
 Heizou?
 I guess it might work.

 I still need to give it some more thought.
Media:vo dialog sdeq001 ayaka 02b 1.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Ah, I see. That's alright.
Media:vo dialog sdeq001 ayaka 02b 2.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: You may let me know if you need anything.

 I'm not really that amazing...
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 20b 1.ogg Kamisato Ayato: No need to be so modest. Your journey thus far already speaks volumes of your bravery.
 Is it me, or does it look like she's burying something?
 It's certainly a possibility...
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 15a 1.ogg Paimon: Ahh! Now even you're trying to scare Paimon!
 It's just a device meant to scare you.
 It's only a trick meant to scare people.
 Just sitting here won't accomplish anything.
 Let me think about it...

Media:vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 08b 2.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: You may let me know if you need anything.
 Let me think about it...
Media:vo sdeq001 8 gorou 10b 1.ogg Gorou: Oh, sure... I completely understand. Perhaps you have a friend you'd like to enter the Test of Courage with?
Media:vo sdeq001 8 gorou 10b 2.ogg Gorou: Anyway, whoever you decide to partner up with, the most important thing is to enjoy the event. Good luck!
 Let me think about it...
Media:vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 10b 1.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Take your time. We'll have plenty of chances to talk later, so there's no need to make a choice this very instant.
Media:vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 10b 2.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: We could even go together for a late night snack once the event is over.
 Let's try not to scare ourselves.
 Long time no see!
 No, not yet...
 Okay.
 Pretty sure that would just make things even scarier...
 Quest DescriptionYou heard that the Test of Courage is being held. Maybe you should head to the Yashiro Commission to have a look...
 So what exactly were you practicing all this time?
 So you mean you want to practice first?
 So, why did we stop running?
 Sounds like you've come to your senses.
 Step DescriptionAfter you commented on Itto's scaring techniques, he decides to hide and scare the Arataki Gang's members a little...
 Step DescriptionAfter you jumped out of the grass, you found out that the people on the other side weren't from the Arataki Gang. Both sides were startled by this encounter. After calming down, Itto decided to track down the three mysterious children...
 Step DescriptionItto suggested that as you proceed with the Test of Courage as usual, he will hide in the shadows and scare people from time to time. You should ask the member of staff for details.
 Step DescriptionThe staff said you needed another partner. Who will it be...
 Step DescriptionTime to go meet the staff with your partner.
 Step DescriptionYou decided to join Ayaka in the first round. What challenges will you encounter along the way?
 Step DescriptionYou decided to join Gorou in the first round. What challenges will you encounter along the way?
 Step DescriptionYou decided to join Kazuha in the first round. What challenges will you encounter along the way?
 Step DescriptionYou encountered Itto outside the Yashiro Commission. He decided to "spice up" the Test of Courage for himself, but you don't know what will happen...
 Step DescriptionYou heard about mysterious games on the beach from Ei. But it doesn't seem to be open yet. You should go back and have a look first.
 Step DescriptionYou spoke with Ayato about the rules of the Test of Courage. Go to the site and check it out.
 Sure sounds like something she'd do...
 Thanks, Ayato.
 That's right!
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 20a 1.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I appreciate your enthusiasm. Hehe, I look forward to seeing how you perform.
 There was a person wearing a weird outfit...
 There's nothing to be scared of.
 Uh, was that the first test?
 Wake up, Paimon.
 We'd better go have a look.
 Were they sent by the Yashiro Commission then?
 What are you doing here?
 Wh—What happened...?
 Wow, Itto...
 Yes, we have.
 You sure do care about your gang members...
 You're finally back to your normal self, Paimon.
 You're getting scared over nothing.
 You're the scariest oni ever.

Media:Vo sdeq001 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: The Yashiro Commission is holding a Test of Courage event! They've even prepared rewards for participants who can pass the event's challenges!
Media:Vo sdeq001 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: But uh, if it's a "Test of Courage," that means it's probably gonna be scary, right? So, if we join, Paimon's gonna let you go first...

Media:Vo sdeq001 21 paimon 02.ogg Paimon Seems we went the wrong way... Let's try a different path!
Media:Vo sdeq001 24 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Hmm... There's something off about this place.
Media:Vo sdeq001 24 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: This unsettling feeling reminds me of a strange story I heard among the troops.
Media:Vo sdeq001 24 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: According to the story, there was an army that was marching through a deserted forest when they discovered a stockpile of delicious food.
Media:Vo sdeq001 24 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: The troops were short on provisions, so they came to a halt and began to eat heartily. Before long, they suddenly noticed several pairs of blood-red eyes staring at them...

Media:Vo sdeq001 29 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: I bet the troops would be happy to have such a good-tasting drink. It's unfortunate that it spoils easily...

Media:Vo sdeq001 29 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: Oh, was it one of your friends? Do you need to go talk to them?
Media:Vo sdeq001 29 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: In that case, I don't want to get in your way. I'll take back the remaining Dango Milk. Maybe I'll run into you in the next Test of Courage round!
(Gorou leaves)
Media:Vo sdeq001 29 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh! It really is Dango Milk! A lot of it, too.
Media:Vo sdeq001 29 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: And look there's a scarecrow here. Now who could have knocked it over— W— Whaa!!! It's standing up!

Media:Vo sdeq001 34 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Once, in my wandering travels, I came upon a bridge, and I had been told that an ominous presence awaited those who cross that bridge at night.
Media:Vo sdeq001 34 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: It was said that there were a pair of lovebirds who tragically fell into the water below and perished. Their grieving spirits converged around the bridge and were never dispersed.

Media:Vo sdeq001 34 kazuha 05.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I stopped and listened for some time, and realized it was a couple disguised as ghosts who blackmailed passersby for their belongings. They were arguing over how to split their ill-gotten loot.
Media:Vo sdeq001 34 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uh, is it just Paimon, or does Chinju Forest feel a little gloomier than before?

Media:vo sdeq001 14 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: There was a wandering samurai who, while crossing the forest at night, noticed that the familiar scenery was beginning to change right in front of him.
Media:vo sdeq001 14 ayaka 03.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: The man stopped and realized that it was as if he was in another world. Strange creatures that didn't appear to be human were all staring at him...
Media:vo sdeq001 14 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Whaa! That's super scary! Paimon doesn't even dare look at all these trees after hearing that story!
Media:vo sdeq001 14 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Will we really be okay...? If anything weird jumps out at us, teach it a lesson, (Traveler)!
Media:vo sdeq001 15 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I can't quite make out what it is, but there seems to be something moving there...
Media:vo sdeq001 15 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Hahaha! Oh, I'll show you how scary this oni can be!
Media:vo sdeq001 15 itto 02.ogg Arataki Itto: Hah! How was that? Were ya scared?
Media:vo sdeq001 15 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ahh! Run!!!
Media:vo sdeq001 16 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Wait... Are these fireworks?
Media:vo sdeq001 16 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh, they suddenly lit up! We'd better keep our distance!
Media:vo sdeq001 16 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's get out of here!
Media:vo sdeq001 17 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Could it be... a spirit that's haunting this place?
Media:vo sdeq001 17 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? Did you hear that voice?
Media:vo sdeq001 17 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oohhh~ We're not here to bother you, uh no need to torment us! We'll even ask someone at the Grand Narukami Shrine to come and free you... hehe!
Media:vo sdeq001 17 yoshiharu 01.ogg ???: The torment~...
Media:vo sdeq001 17 yoshiharu 02.ogg ???: Ah, the torment~... You will suffer with me~!
Media:vo sdeq001 18 yoshiharu 01.ogg ???: Oh no, you spotted me!
Media:vo sdeq001 18 yoshiharu 02.ogg ???: Shh! Please, not a word of this to anyone! Otherwise, they'll dock my pay.
Media:vo sdeq001 19 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Look, everyone. Isn't this the Dango Milk we are searching for?
Media:vo sdeq001 19 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: And there's a scarecrow beside it. Strange... What is that doing here?
Media:vo sdeq001 19 ayaka 03.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: It appears to be guarding the Dango Milk here...
Media:vo sdeq001 19 ayaka 04.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Indeed. Any fears I had a moment ago seem to have been dissipated by the Dango Milk.
Media:vo sdeq001 19 ayaka 05.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: And now that I look around, this is Chinju Forest as I have always known it. After making it here, it doesn't seem nearly as frightening.
Media:vo sdeq001 19 ayaka 06.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: My brother once said that fear stems from one's heart, and if your heart is at peace, then fear naturally dissipates. Now I understand what he meant.
Media:vo sdeq001 19 ayaka 07.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: But fear is not entirely bad... Although I've been scared a few times, I still feel happy now.
Media:vo sdeq001 19 ayaka 08.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I would like to continue walking through the forest for a while. Will you accompany me?
Media:vo sdeq001 19 ayaka 09.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Ah, I see. Well, I shall continue walking while you go greet your friend.
Media:vo sdeq001 19 ayaka 10.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Don't worry. Now that I've experienced the event once already, I won't be easily frightened. I'll see you later. Have a lovely chat with your friend.
(Ayaka leaves)
Media:vo sdeq001 19 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Well, it doesn't matter now! Since we found the Dango Milk, then we must be the first ones here, right?
Media:vo sdeq001 19 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: But there's no way we can carry back so much Dango Milk. Why don't we drink some to lighten the load a little?
Media:vo sdeq001 19 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Paimon could use a sip... Whaa!!! The scarecrow stood up!
Media:vo sdeq001 19 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: You mean, it's watching if we touch the Dango Milk? Uh, don't worry, P—Paimon didn't even touch it!
Media:vo sdeq001 19 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Oh, maybe you're right, Paimon will try to calm down... Let's try some together!
Media:vo sdeq001 19 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Mmm, tastes great!
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 01.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Ah, it's you two. Yes, it has been a while.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 02.ogg Kamisato Ayato: You think I only make an appearance for occasions that are deemed sufficiently important? Hehe.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 03.ogg Kamisato Ayato: It just so happens that this Test of Courage event was actually my suggestion, but naturally, I've left the planning and more trifling details to be arranged by my retainers.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 04.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Considering that such events are quite popular across Teyvat, I've had numerous examples to draw from, so everything should be in good order. I'm merely here to do a routine check on the progress of the event, that's all.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 05.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Heh, only Paimon could be so natural at ordering others around.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 06.ogg Kamisato Ayato: However... the possibility remains that we may yet require your assistance.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 07.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Ah, nothing. Hehe, seeing as I apparently have some time, I suppose we may chat about the event for a moment.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 08.ogg Kamisato Ayato: As its name implies, the event is a game designed to put one's courage to the test.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 09.ogg Kamisato Ayato: The venue for the event will be set up in the Chinju Forest. Before the start of each round, participants will be divided into teams of two.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 10.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Once teams have been formed, the event staff will announce the name of an item that has been placed in or around the Chinju Forest area.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 11.ogg Kamisato Ayato: The first person to locate the specified item will be declared the winner of that round.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 12.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Precisely. There will be a total of three rounds in the Test of Courage because the event was actually orchestrated by three different parties.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 13.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Merchants raised event funding, the Kamisato Clan provided the grounds, and the Grand Narukami Shrine provided consulting services.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 14.ogg Kamisato Ayato: As such, each of these three parties have selected one item for participants to find, so naturally, the event will require three rounds to determine the winners.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 15.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Yes, seems you've got the gist of it. We will be issuing different rewards based on the number of rounds won, so if a participant wins multiple rounds, then that will also be reflected in their final reward.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 16.ogg Kamisato Ayato: If a participant manages to find all three items, then they shall receive the grand prize provided by the Grand Narukami Shrine.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 17.ogg Kamisato Ayato: As for its true value, I'm afraid you'll have to win the event first and ask Lady Guuji yourself.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 18.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Of course, this event is intended to measure your courage. If you withdraw from the event because you become too frightened, then you might as well forget about seeing any rewards.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 19.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I'm curious myself how many people will be brave enough to make it to the end. It'll be most disappointing if nobody claims the prizes we've prepared.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 20a 1.ogg Kamisato Ayato: I appreciate your enthusiasm. Hehe, I look forward to seeing how you perform.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 20b 1.ogg Kamisato Ayato: No need to be so modest. Your journey thus far already speaks volumes of your bravery.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 21.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Anyway, I think I've given you sufficient details. I'll add your names to the list of participants momentarily.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 22.ogg Kamisato Ayato: As for the three items you'll be searching for, please wait for a staff member to inform you at the start of the event.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 ayato 23.ogg Kamisato Ayato: Oh, and a friendly word of advice... Test of Courage events tend to give rise to a variety of strange rumors and stories, so please, be sure to exercise caution.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ayato~!
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hehe, we heard the Yashiro Commission is holding a Test of Courage, so we came right over to sign ourselves up!
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We didn't expect to see you here in person, though. Does that mean this event is really important?
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it... so what you're saying is you're not very busy right now.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: In that case, maybe you can give us a quick rundown of the event rules!
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Uh, sorry? What did you say?
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Yippee!
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: "The winner of that round"? Huh, so there's gonna be multiple rounds to the Test of Courage?
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Ah, Paimon gets it. So basically, it boils down to searching for stuff in Chinju Forest.
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: We'll need to find one item each round, for a total of three items after three rounds. Simple enough for Paimon!
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Oh, a grand prize! Sounds like it could be really valuable!
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Don't worry, those prizes are as good as ours!
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Even though just the thought of this event sends shivers down Paimon's little spine, (Traveler) will be brave enough, no doubt about that!
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Whoa! What did he mean by that!? Oh, will there be spooky things in Chinju Forest?
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 15a 1.ogg Paimon: Ahh! Now even you're trying to scare Paimon!
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 15b 1.ogg Paimon: Heh, Paimon thought so, too... Well, in that case, there's nothing to be scared of!
Media:vo sdeq001 2 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: Anyway, we've got an event to win... Grand prize, here we come!
Media:vo sdeq001 20 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Aww, Paimon thought we found it, but it doesn't seem to be here.
Media:vo sdeq001 20 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's keep searching somewhere else!
Media:vo sdeq001 22 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Please... stay a little closer.
Media:vo sdeq001 23 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Would you like to stop for a rest?
Media:vo sdeq001 28 yoshiharu 01.ogg ???: Oh no, you spotted me!
Media:vo sdeq001 28 yoshiharu 02.ogg ???: Shh! Please, not a word of this to anyone! Otherwise, they'll dock my pay.
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Hold it right there! Haha, well if it isn't my compadres! Didn't expect to see you here.
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 02.ogg Arataki Itto: Hah, what else! I'm sorry, but those prizes already belong to yours truly... Arataki "Ain't Scared of Nothin'" Itto!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 03.ogg Arataki Itto: I mean, well, that's what I really wanna say... But uh, I've actually got something else goin' on.
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 04.ogg Arataki Itto: Ah, it's a long story. As soon as I heard about the Test of Courage, I got the gang together and was ready to bring everyone for the time of their lives.
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 05.ogg Arataki Itto: But uh, it turns out the other members weren't as pumped about the event as me...
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 06.ogg Arataki Itto: "Chinju Forest? We've already been there a million times. There's nothing scary about that place!"
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 07.ogg Arataki Itto: "That event's just a game for kids! What a waste of time... Let's play some Genius Invokation TCG!"
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 08.ogg Arataki Itto: "Seriously, Test of Courage!? Ugh, whatever. I guess if that's what the boss wants..."
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 09.ogg Arataki Itto: Can you believe that!? What a group of deadbeats... I'm not gonna put up with that, nuh-uh, not in my gang!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 10.ogg Arataki Itto: Hey, this isn't about me!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 11.ogg Arataki Itto: As leader of the Arataki Gang, it's my duty to find new and tantalizing experiences for everyone. A happy gang means a happy life!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 12.ogg Arataki Itto: Even if they can't get it through their stubborn heads now, one way or another, I'll show them how much fun a Test of Courage can be!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 13.ogg Arataki Itto: Anywayyy, I'm no stranger to Chinju Forest. Sure, it was a little terrifying going through there, but hey, I'm used to it now!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 14.ogg Arataki Itto: And seriously, what kind of scary pranks could those guys in the Yashiro Commission ever come up with? If they can't scare anyone, then it's not gonna be a "test of courage" now, is it?
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 15.ogg Arataki Itto: Not to mention, if the gang starts complaining... I won't ever be able to show my face around here.
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 16.ogg Arataki Itto: Ah, well, leading a gang can be complicated. You don't understand... Anywho, I've got a plan.
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 17.ogg Arataki Itto: Since there's no way I can trust the Yashiro Commission to make a fun event, I've decided to step in and spice things up a little.
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 18.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh, you bet I do! Yours truly is gonna be out scaring people! Hahaha, I'm taking this event to a whole 'nother level!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 19.ogg Arataki Itto: But it's gonna take more than an oni to make it happen... So I came here to recruit some help, and then I saw you come walking along.
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 20.ogg Arataki Itto: C'mon! Come scare people with me, please!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 21.ogg Arataki Itto: Pretty please!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 22.ogg Arataki Itto: Pretty pretty pleaseee!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 23.ogg Arataki Itto: Hahaha, yes! You're a real oni saver! Don't worry, with me around, winning the Test of Courage will be a piece of cake.
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 24.ogg Arataki Itto: Alright, those participants won't scare themselves! Let's get out there, hahaha!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 itto 25.ogg Arataki Itto: Hey! (Traveler), Paimon, enough chitchat! We're gonna miss the event!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh, Paimon knows that voice... It's Itto! What are you doing here?
Media:vo sdeq001 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wait, don't tell Paimon that you're here for the Test of Courage.
Media:vo sdeq001 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh? What's that?
Media:vo sdeq001 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it now... dragging the gang to an event they don't want to go to won't be the best for your reputation as a leader.
Media:vo sdeq001 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: And after all that talk, it still boils down to you!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Wait, you don't seriously mean that...
Media:vo sdeq001 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: No way!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Forget it!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Ugh, fine! But don't forget, we're here to win the Test of Courage and take home the grand prize.
Media:vo sdeq001 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: We'll help you out. Just don't get in the way of our prize.
Media:vo sdeq001 3 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: What a noisy guy... Hmm, but after hearing him laugh and talk, Paimon doesn't feel scared anymore.
Media:vo sdeq001 3 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Huh, maybe laughter is the key to making fear go away! If things get scary later, we can all start laughing at the top of our lungs!
Media:vo sdeq001 3 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Ah! Coming!
(Heizou watches from a distance)
Media:vo sdeq001 30 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Aww, Paimon thought we found it, but it doesn't seem to be here.
Media:vo sdeq001 30 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's keep searching somewhere else!
Media:vo sdeq001 38 yoshiharu 01.ogg ???: Oh no, you spotted me!
Media:vo sdeq001 38 yoshiharu 02.ogg ???: Shh! Please, not a word of this to anyone! Otherwise, they'll dock my pay.
Media:vo sdeq001 4 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Hey, Paimon!
Media:vo sdeq001 4 itto 02.ogg Arataki Itto: Ah nothing, I just had a thought occur to me.
Media:vo sdeq001 4 itto 03.ogg Arataki Itto: I want to scare the gang members real good, but now that I think about it, I've never actually scared anyone before.
Media:vo sdeq001 4 itto 04.ogg Arataki Itto: Practice? Oh, now there's an idea.
Media:vo sdeq001 4 itto 05.ogg Arataki Itto: Hey, I've got it! Why don't you join the Test of Courage like everyone else, and I'll go hide and try to scare you from time to time?
Media:vo sdeq001 4 itto 06.ogg Arataki Itto: Then, you two can judge my scaring skills. Alright, that's the plan. Lemme go get ready!
Media:vo sdeq001 4 itto 07.ogg Arataki Itto: Just wait, you'll see how scary this oni can be! Hahaha!
Media:vo sdeq001 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Alright, this looks like the place.
Media:vo sdeq001 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh, is it just Paimon, or does it look a lot scarier than usual here?
Media:vo sdeq001 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Waaah!!!
Media:vo sdeq001 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Argh! Don't sneak up on Paimon like that! What do you want?
Media:vo sdeq001 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: ...You're only now realizing this?
Media:vo sdeq001 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: And there he goes, running off and still talking to himself...
Media:vo sdeq001 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Well, we were here to join the event anyway. Guess we'll just have to pass Itto's little "test" along with whatever else the event throws at us.
Media:vo sdeq001 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Oh, seems one of the event staff is over there. Let's go talk to her.
Media:vo sdeq001 40 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Aww, Paimon thought we found it, but it doesn't seem to be here.
Media:vo sdeq001 40 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Let's keep searching somewhere else!
Media:vo sdeq001 44 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Ei?
Media:vo sdeq001 44 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whoa! It's really you! What are you doing here?
Media:vo sdeq001 44 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ah, so that's why you're here. So, what do you think of the Test of Courage, are you having fun?
Media:vo sdeq001 44 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, that Miko! Did she send Ei here to scare people on purpose!?
Media:vo sdeq001 44 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: If that's the case, it feels like Ei isn't really experiencing the event like everyone else...
Media:vo sdeq001 44 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Oh, Paimon has an idea! We'll give you a bottle of the Dango Milk we just found. That would make you a winner in this round, too!
Media:vo sdeq001 44 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Huh? A familiar feeling?
Media:vo sdeq001 44 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Akitsu Hazura? What's that?
Media:vo sdeq001 44 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Oh, does that mean you could eat the delicious festival food whenever you liked?
Media:vo sdeq001 44 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Sounds like it could be fun! Paimon would like to play!
Media:vo sdeq001 44 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Yay!
Media:vo sdeq001 44 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Oh, of course! Hehe...
Media:vo sdeq001 44 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Paimon doesn't remember hearing anything about a game on the beach from Ayato... You think that activity's also planned by the Yashiro Commission?
Media:vo sdeq001 44 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Oh, the more Paimon thinks about it, the scarier it feels... Ugh, this whole Test of Courage thing is keeping Paimon on edge!
Media:vo sdeq001 44 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Anyway, the first round of the event should be finished by now, so let's head back!
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 01.ogg Ei: Oh, hello. Miko told me about the Test of Courage event taking place here. I thought I would come and have a look.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 02.ogg Ei: It's more or less the same as I remember before.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 03.ogg Ei: I wasn't scared by anything... But on the contrary, some of the event participants were horrified the moment they saw me.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 04.ogg Ei: Ah yes, isn't that the dessert drink we had the last time we met? Sure, I'll take one.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 05.ogg Ei: Actually, I've sensed a familiar feeling ever since I arrived here. It's brought some old memories to mind.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 06.ogg Ei: Have you been down to the beach by any chance?
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 07.ogg Ei: I was just strolling nearby when I noticed a space at the beach with a familiar game set up on it.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 08.ogg Ei: I took a brief look, and it appeared to be a game where you control flippers hovering in the air to strike a ball and hit some positioned elemental cubes.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 09.ogg Ei: I saw the game was called "Akitsu Yuugei." I'm guessing it originated from "Akitsu Hazura." The thought of that game caused me to recall some things from the past.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 10.ogg Ei: It's a game where you use hagoita to hit a ball towards a set target. It was once quite popular during festivals.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 11.ogg Ei: Makoto also enjoyed playing Akitsu Hazura when she was alive. Hyakkiyakou was still around at that time, and nights in Inazuma were much more lively than they are now.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 12.ogg Ei: The youkai would hold festivals from time to time, gathering to drink, laugh, and play music...
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 13.ogg Ei: Yes. The youkai called their celebration the "Mikawa Flower Festival." Makoto and I attended it once... She found it particularly fascinating.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 14.ogg Ei: Sadly, the past has all but vanished. But seeing a game like that again does make me feel happy.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 15.ogg Ei: If you're interested, you can go to the beach and give it a try.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 16.ogg Ei: It was still being set up when I was there earlier, but I assume it should be ready soon.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 17.ogg Ei: I shall return to Tenshukaku. Miko told me that the Test of Courage consists of three rounds, so please keep up the effort and give it your best until the end.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 18.ogg Ei: Considering you two, I think you should have no problem making it to the end.
Media:vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 19.ogg Ei: I know you can do it, good luck.
(Ei leaves)
Media:vo sdeq001 45 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: So? What'd you think? Do I know how to scare people or what!?
Media:vo sdeq001 45 itto 02a 1.ogg Arataki Itto: What? No way! Listen, every time I made my move, I scared the living daylights out of everyone!
Media:vo sdeq001 45 itto 02b 1.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh? Really?
Media:vo sdeq001 45 itto 03.ogg Arataki Itto: Even I had no idea I possessed such talent... But this is just what I needed to hear! Now I'll show 'em — the gang will know just how terrifying their leader can be!
Media:vo sdeq001 45 itto 04.ogg Arataki Itto: Anyway, I already figured out which path they'll be taking, so let's wait nearby and scare the pants off 'em!
Media:vo sdeq001 45 itto 05.ogg Arataki Itto: Hahaha, now things are getting interesting! You ready? We've got people to scare!
Media:vo sdeq001 45 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh uh, let Paimon think...
Media:vo sdeq001 45 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Uh... Paimon was hiding behind you the entire time, so Paimon didn't really notice Itto scaring us at all...
Media:vo sdeq001 45 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Uh, Paimon will leave this one to (Traveler)! So, was Itto scary or not?
Media:vo sdeq001 46 hitotsumekozou 01.ogg ???: Ghosts!
(Both parties run off in opposite directions)
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Shh... I think we're getting close.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 02.ogg Arataki Itto: C'mon c'mon c'mon!!! Can't let them see us!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 03.ogg Arataki Itto: Easy peasy. We'll wait for them to get real close, and then we'll jump out and shout together. They won't know what hit them!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 04.ogg Arataki Itto: Hey, don't underestimate me. It may sound simple, but I know exactly what will scare them.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 05.ogg Arataki Itto: The gang's probably moping along on their way back, saying things like, "this is boring" and "let's go home."
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 06.ogg Arataki Itto: But it's dark and their guard is down — now's our chance. Having the three of us suddenly come flying outta the bushes is gonna scare 'em real good.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 07.ogg Arataki Itto: Before they come to their senses, we'll already be half-way to our next ambush spot!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 08.ogg Arataki Itto: Shh! You hear that? Someone's coming. It must be them.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 09.ogg Arataki Itto: Alright, I'll count us in, ready? We jump on zero! Three...
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 10.ogg Arataki Itto: Two...
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 11.ogg Arataki Itto: One...
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 12.ogg Arataki Itto: Haaah!!!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 13.ogg Arataki Itto: Huh!? Wait, you're not—
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 14.ogg Arataki Itto: Wait, hold on a second.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 15.ogg Arataki Itto: Haha, Paimon, I didn't expect you to be such a baby!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 16.ogg Arataki Itto: Well, you shouted "ghosts," so my instinct to escort you two to safety kicked in.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 17.ogg Arataki Itto: After all, real "ghosts" are terrifying, my skills are completely useless against 'em!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 18.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh, because I just realized that they were also running from us.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 19.ogg Arataki Itto: Which means they were afraid of us, too... And if that's the case, then there shouldn't be anything to worry about.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 20.ogg Arataki Itto: Now that I've calmed down, I'm starting to wonder if they were actually ghosts... They might have been people dressed up as ghosts to scare us!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 21.ogg Arataki Itto: Definitely not. During the event, I took a little walk around the Chinju Forest and saw all the gimmicks that the Yashiro Commission had set up.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 22.ogg Arataki Itto: Those three weren't from the Yashiro Commission, but they did seem a little familiar...
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 23.ogg Arataki Itto: C'mon, let's go back there and take a look!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 24.ogg Arataki Itto: It's alright, Paimon. If you're scared, you can stay here. (Traveler) and I will go investigate.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 25.ogg Arataki Itto: It looked like they were running that way. But it's hard to say exactly where they went, so let's split up!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 26.ogg Arataki Itto: Hahaha! Don't worry about me. Once my rear's in gear, I'm not afraid of nothin'.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 27.ogg Arataki Itto: They scared you that bad, huh? Looks like they really do have a knack for spooking people.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 itto 28.ogg Arataki Itto: This time, I'll capture them and learn their art for scaring people! Anyway, I'll catch you around!
(Itto runs off)
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Oh, here they come... So how are you going to scare them, Itto?
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? What're we, a bunch of kids now...?
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wooga booga booga!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Th—They're... They're...!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Ghosts!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Ahh! Did you see that!? They were definitely not human!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: So all the strange rumors about the Test of Courage are true... Oh, what should we do? Do you think the ghosts are coming after us?
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Hey, you're one to talk! You were the first to start running! Don't make fun of Paimon!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Huh? Now you wanna go back?
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: B—But... th—there's still a chance that they were real spirits, right?
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: If we go back now, they might try to eat us...
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Really? Whew, that'd be great!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Oh, right! The last mystery novel Paimon bought from Yae Publishing House had a plot just like that...
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: During the investigation, whoever said "I'm not going" would always be the next victim.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Uh, so on second thought, Paimon's going with you. Don't ever leave Paimon behind! EVER!
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: But then you'll be all alone, which, according to the mystery novels, is super dangerous.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Oh~ Paimon has a bad feeling about this...
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: And there he goes, running off and talking to himself... again.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: Uh, do we really have to go?
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: Ugh fine, let's go take a look then.
Media:vo sdeq001 46 paimon 21.ogg Paimon: But the second we see anything scary, we make a run for it! Got it?
Media:vo sdeq001 47 chizuru 01.ogg ???: ...
Media:vo sdeq001 47 chizuru 02.ogg ???: Don't do it, Chizuru...
Media:vo sdeq001 47 chizuru 03.ogg ???: You can't give in to your desires... Others will suffer for it. You mustn't make the same mistake...
Media:vo sdeq001 47 chizuru 04.ogg ???: Just hold on a little longer... you've already come all this way, right?
Media:vo sdeq001 47 chizuru 05.ogg ???: Are you... talking to me?
Media:vo sdeq001 47 chizuru 06.ogg ???: To... someone like me?
Media:vo sdeq001 47 chizuru 07.ogg ???: You have no business coming here. You shouldn't be anywhere near me...
Media:vo sdeq001 47 chizuru 08.ogg ???: If you value your lives, you must leave immediately. Otherwise, your souls will be trapped here forever.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 chizuru 09.ogg ???: I won't warn you again. Now, away with you... be gone...!
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 01.ogg ???: Wake up. Hey, Traveler... wake up!
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 02.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Thank goodness you're okay.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 03.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Before we get to that, I think someone needs your attention first.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 04.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Scary person?
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 05.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Okay, I see...
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 06.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I only found the two of you passed out here when I arrived. There was no one else around.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 07.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: What happened? Tell me all the details.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 08.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: As I suspected, there appears to be something more behind this Test of Courage event.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 09.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But let's get back to your original question, I haven't told you the reason I'm here.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 10.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The truth is, I was commissioned to come here for an investigation.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 11.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: That's right. Some time ago, a peculiar game was discovered on the beach.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 12.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Ah, so you've heard of it...
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 13.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The game quietly appeared some time ago and has since attracted some players. Apparently, it's very interesting.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 14.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: There was no one on the beach other than visitors and tourists when the game appeared. Imagine it like this: a stall suddenly appears on the street with no owner...
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 15.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: And stranger yet, it could operate normally without anyone supervising it. People at the beach can start the game simply by talking to the Bulletin Board...
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 16.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Some tourists started to say that, and the rumor began to spread, until it became a full-blown ghost story. The further that story spread, the more plausible it seemed, causing people to be unwilling to go anywhere near the beach.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 17.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: The Tenryou Commission wanted to close the beach in order to investigate the situation and dispel the rumors, but before they could do anything, the Yashiro Commission organized the Test of Courage event here.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 18.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: People that were initially scared by the rumors began to believe that the "beach game" was actually a preview event planned by the Yashiro Commission for the Test of Courage, so visitors have gradually returned again.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 19.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: But I'm quite positive that the game never had anything to do with the Yashiro Commission...
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 20.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Who knows? But I'd rather trust tangible evidence than speculate on his thoughts.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 21.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: As for my commission, apparently someone reported that they found themselves trapped for hours on the beach while playing the game.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 22.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: According to his own account, he kept returning to the same location no matter which way he went, and even though his friends were nearby, they couldn't see him.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 23.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Even though it was obvious that he wasn't telling me the whole story, the testimonies of his friends did validate that what he said actually occurred.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 24.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: On top of that, it was also this very incident that led to all the ghost rumors. No one dared to go near the beach until the Yashiro Commission announced the Test of Courage...
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 25.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Who set up the game on the beach? And why did the Yashiro Commission help them cover it up?
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 26.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: I need to uncover the truth, so I'm here to investigate.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 27.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: Anyway, don't mind me. Working together will only raise suspicion, so I'll undertake my own investigation for the time being.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 heizou 28.ogg Shikanoin Heizou: However, please proceed with caution. Based on my observations, most people are still unaware of anything happening here. Telling people that something's amiss might cause quite a stir.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Well, we've already walked all the way here...
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Hmm, wonder where those three went... Paimon didn't see them anywhere.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Maybe Itto was right! Maybe they've been hiding. Seems like they're not scary after all!
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hey! Listen up, you three little wimps! Paimon can already see you guys, so just come out and show yourselves!
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Waaaah!!! There's someone actually here! Paimon's scared again!
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Uh, excuse us. Did you happen to see three rascals pass by here? Let Paimon tell you what they look like...
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Waaaah!!!
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: *sobbing*... Please don't eat Paimon... Paimon doesn't taste very good.
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Please! Avenge Paimon...
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Ah! Are you here to rescue Paimon?
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Oh, and Heizou's here too! Huh? What happened to that scary person just now? Did you manage to defeat her?
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: You were... commissioned?
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: A peculiar game on the beach... Ohh, could it be the Akitsu Yuugei game that Ei mentioned?
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Could it be run by... ghosts?
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Wait, so the Yashiro Commission were fully aware of all the spooky stuff going on, but they still decided to hold their event here?
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: But... Ayato must be one of the smartest guys we know. What the heck was he thinking!?
Media:vo sdeq001 47 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Ah, that sounds so scary!
Media:vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 01.ogg Shrine Maiden: Aha, you must be here to participate in the Test of Courage?
Media:vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 02.ogg Shrine Maiden: That's right. Huh, I can already see a dark aura surrounding the two of you... Yes, truly ominous.
Media:vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 03.ogg Shrine Maiden: If you carelessly go running into the event, all it'll take is one little misstep and the darkness will swallow you up, hehehe...
Media:vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 04.ogg Shrine Maiden: Sure you don't want to back out? This is your last chance. I'll count it down... three... two... one. Welcome to the Test of Courage... Enter at your own risk.
Media:vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 05.ogg Shrine Maiden: Sure, you could say that. You know, the most unfortunate tales always happen unexpectedly on just a normal, average day... just like today.
Media:vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 06.ogg Shrine Maiden: But no need to worry. Allay your qualms and suspicions... Everything was already set into motion the moment you two stepped into this place.
Media:vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 07.ogg Shrine Maiden: Just enjoy the calm before the storm... The first round is about to begin. Have you already decided on your partner?
Media:vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 08.ogg Shrine Maiden: ...Hmm?
Media:vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 09.ogg Shrine Maiden: But it appears your names were written together as a single participant... "(Traveler) and Paimon."
Media:vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 10.ogg Shrine Maiden: Which means, you'll have to find yourselves another partner in order to join the event.
Media:vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 11.ogg Shrine Maiden: As far as I know, there have been other participants who have yet to designate a partner. You could go ask around.
Media:vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 12.ogg Shrine Maiden: Just be sure to make it quick. If you don't have a partner by the time the event starts, then you'll be immediately disqualified!
Media:vo sdeq001 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Yep, that's right! Uh, judging from your outfit, you must be one of the shrine maidens from the Grand Narukami Shrine!
Media:vo sdeq001 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Whoa! What's with the sinister laugh...? Is she really a shrine maiden?
Media:vo sdeq001 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ah, you finally said something that Paimon can understand! Yep, the two of us will be partners! We always make the best team!
Media:vo sdeq001 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Wait, are you serious!?
Media:vo sdeq001 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Ugh, if only Itto hadn't gone running off on his own, we could have had a partner! Now what should we do?
Media:vo sdeq001 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Uh oh, we can't let that happen! Let's go see if we can find anyone to partner up with nearby!
Media:vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 01.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, (Traveler) and Paimon! Greetings!
Media:vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 02.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, my brother told me that the event would be "most interesting," and suggested that I personally participate.
Media:vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 03.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I have never experienced a Test of Courage event, so I don't really know what to expect.
Media:vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 04.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: To be frank, I'm no expert when it comes to the supernatural... I often worry that I haven't shown spirits proper respect and have brought shame upon my clan.
Media:vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 05.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, speaking of which, may I ask if the two of you are partners for the event?
Media:vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 06.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Splendid. In that case, how would you like to be my partner?
Media:vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 07.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: I always feel at ease when you're by my side. Ah, but of course, please don't let me get in the way if you wish to participate with someone else...
Media:vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 08a 1.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, you'd really like to? Then it's my honor... Or I suppose I should say, please pardon my inexperience.
Media:vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 08a 2.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: And if I appear to be frightened, please promise not to laugh at me.
Media:vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 08b 1.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: Sure, I understand. I'll be waiting for you here.
Media:vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 08b 2.ogg Kamisato Ayaka: You may let me know if you need anything.
Media:vo sdeq001 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh, it's Ayaka! Are you here for the Test of Courage, too?
Media:vo sdeq001 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Oh, so this is your first time?
Media:vo sdeq001 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Actually, the shrine maiden just told us that we only count as a single participant, however that works... so we're looking for a partner now!
Media:vo sdeq001 8 gorou 01.ogg Gorou: Ah (Traveler), Paimon! I didn't expect to run into you here!
Media:vo sdeq001 8 gorou 02.ogg Gorou: Well... I was originally headed to Yae Publishing House to hand in responses for this month's issue of That's Life.
Media:vo sdeq001 8 gorou 03.ogg Gorou: But I had no idea that that crafty fox would be there! She brought up the Test of Courage event and suggested I give it a try.
Media:vo sdeq001 8 gorou 04.ogg Gorou: I wasn't interested, but she said, "The mighty general of Watatsumi Island isn't afraid of anything, is he?"
Media:vo sdeq001 8 gorou 05.ogg Gorou: And before I knew it, I found myself caught in her persuasive mind games. *sigh* I immediately regretted it the moment I arrived here. There could be traps everywhere...
Media:vo sdeq001 8 gorou 06.ogg Gorou: My instinct tells me that the forest is chock-full of ambushes. One misstep and it'll be over.
Media:vo sdeq001 8 gorou 07.ogg Gorou: Perhaps that crafty fox is hiding somewhere in the dark, waiting for another opportunity to tease me. Who knows, she might even use a Kamera and send embarrassing photos back to Watatsumi Island...
Media:vo sdeq001 8 gorou 08.ogg Gorou: Her Excellency once said, "When you march into an ambush, escape the enemy vanguard. When escape is impossible, then seek ample reinforcements."
Media:vo sdeq001 8 gorou 09.ogg Gorou: Hmm, now that you're here, maybe we can turn the tables. Could I ask you two to partner up with me?
Media:vo sdeq001 8 gorou 10a 1.ogg Gorou: Great! This'll be our chance to fight side by side once again!
Media:vo sdeq001 8 gorou 10a 2.ogg Gorou: With you around, there's nothing to fear! That crafty fox's games are over!
Media:vo sdeq001 8 gorou 10b 1.ogg Gorou: Oh, sure... I completely understand. Perhaps you have a friend you'd like to enter the Test of Courage with?
Media:vo sdeq001 8 gorou 10b 2.ogg Gorou: Anyway, whoever you decide to partner up with, the most important thing is to enjoy the event. Good luck!
Media:vo sdeq001 8 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Gorou!
Media:vo sdeq001 8 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We're here for the Test of Courage! How about you?
Media:vo sdeq001 8 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, this event's sounding more and more dangerous...
Media:vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: There was a familiar scent upon the wind. I knew that I'd see you around here.
Media:vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: We meet again.
Media:vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: And why's that? Do I seem unsuited for this sort of event?
Media:vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: You flatter me. I suppose that's only a reflection of my time wandering the wilderness. I've heard many strange stories in my travels.
Media:vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 05.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I can say I've even experienced a few myself. Over time, I must have gotten used to it.
Media:vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 06.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: After hearing the Yashiro Commission promote the rewards for this event, I was guessing that you two would show up.
Media:vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 07.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Since we hadn't seen each other for some time, I figured I might as well come and see you. After all, meeting someone after being apart for so long always lifts the spirits.
Media:vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 08.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: That's right. So, tell me, how has your journey been lately?
Media:vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 09.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: No, not yet. Do you need me to be your partner?
Media:vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 10a 1.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Very well, then. I wouldn't mind a walk together.
Media:vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 10a 2.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I haven't participated in many of these events, so I'm curious what new experiences lie ahead.
Media:vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 10b 1.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Take your time. We'll have plenty of chances to talk later, so there's no need to make a choice this very instant.
Media:vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 10b 2.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: We could even go together for a late night snack once the event is over.
Media:vo sdeq001 9 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Kazuha!
Media:vo sdeq001 9 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon didn't expect to see you at the Test of Courage!
Media:vo sdeq001 9 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: No, not at all! It's just that Paimon's never seen you get scared, Kazuha.
Media:vo sdeq001 9 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: You're always so calm and collected. It's like you've never been scared by anything!
Media:vo sdeq001 9 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Ah, that makes sense! But uh, why do you want to join the Test of Courage?
Media:vo sdeq001 9 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Oh, so you were waiting for us?
Media:vo sdeq001 9 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Things have gone pretty well! Uh, by the way, the shrine maiden told us that everyone needs a partner to participate in the Test of Courage event. Have you found a partner yet, Kazuha?
No wonder he always wears a confident smile on his face — that's what we call the ease of a genius.
