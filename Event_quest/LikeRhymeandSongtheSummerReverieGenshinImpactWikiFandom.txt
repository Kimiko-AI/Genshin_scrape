 (Wait, so there's some sort of... Mirage Archon?)
 ...
 I understand.
 A few Inazuman friends made some for me.
 About "Hymn of the Holy Land"...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03b 1.ogg Fischl: It is the sacred scripture of the Immernachtreich. It must never be allowed to fall into disrepair from a lack of upkeep...
 I'll take good care of it.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03b 2.ogg Fischl: Hmph, you'd better.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 oz 01b.ogg Oz: In mein Fräulein's mind, it is a treasured memento of this journey. She is positively thrilled to know that you also see it as such.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03b 3.ogg Fischl: Oz, do not over-interpret my speech!
 About Nachtraben Theater...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03a 1.ogg Fischl: Oh? You have witnessed the theater of the Holy Land?
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03a 2.ogg Fischl: Alright, out with it, be liberal with your words of praise. It is a singular achievement in all the world.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 oz 01a.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein eagerly anticipates your comments.
 About drinking...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03a 1.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Ahem...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03a 2.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: That was days ago. I'm surprised you still remember...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03a 3.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Fine drinks belong in the same space as poetry and elegance. To lose myself like that in the tavern... it was truly humiliating.
 About friends...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03a 1.ogg Xinyan: I am going to share this adventure with my friends when I get back. Who knows, it may even give Yun Jin some new ideas for her opera.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03a 2.ogg Xinyan: As for Xiangling, I'm sure she'll come up with a bunch of suggestions the minute that anything cooking-related comes up.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03a 3.ogg Xinyan: You know her, a true professional, she knows everything... Like how to make a good stew without a pot. That's something I'd like to learn from her...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03a 4.ogg Xinyan: I need to learn some new dishes before my new friends come to visit. Oh, and Roasted Lavender Melons is definitely gonna be one of them!
 About music...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03b 1.ogg Xinyan: Are you a little disappointed that I didn't play any rock music back in my mirage?
 Not at all.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03b 2.ogg Xinyan: Whew, glad to hear it.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03b 3.ogg Xinyan: Rock 'n' roll is my first love, that'll never change.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03b 4.ogg Xinyan: But music is also a vehicle for all kinds of emotions. Rather than only expressing my own feelings, I figured what I did was more suitable for the occasion.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03b 5.ogg Xinyan: Hehe, perhaps now, I can call you a kindred spirit in our understanding of music.
 About the starry sky...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03b 1.ogg Mona: Oh, I actually wanted to ask you as well. How did you feel when you saw that stretch of sky?
 It was magnificent!
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03b 2.ogg Mona: Oh... oh really?
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03b 3.ogg Mona: Well, I—I am a genius astrologist, after all. Of course my mirage was going to be magnificent...
 That's the Mona I know!
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03b 4.ogg Mona: Hmm... But I was so immersed in my thoughts at the time, I didn't realize how magnificent until I heard you speak...
 It was so spellbinding!
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03b 5.ogg Mona: Yes, I know... It was on purpose, wasn't it?
 About this vacation...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03c 1.ogg Fischl: One was most delighted to behold the grand ceremony and celebration with which one's official excursion to this blessed land was received.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03c 2.ogg Fischl: Alas, my journey through countless worlds has taught me that even the most splendid of things must come to an end.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03c 3.ogg Fischl: This is why I have declared to my people that my excursion goes on, as there are still attendants from faraway lands who require the Prinzessin's royal assistance.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 oz 01c.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein cried when she bade farewell to everyone.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03c 4.ogg Fischl: Oz! I told you, that was only because an insolent grain of sand rudely took refuge in my eyes!
 About this vacation...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03c 1.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: It's had its ups and downs, but ultimately, it's been quite rewarding.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03c 2.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: If Beidou and the crew ask me about our experiences, I suppose I'll tell them about the squirrel and the ship spirit... as for stories about my new friends, I'll keep them to myself.
 That's good.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03c 3.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: The end of every journey marks the beginning of a new adventure. I'm sure this is a feeling you are most familiar with, (Traveler).
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03c 4.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Keep moving forwards. That's the important thing.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03c 5.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Just like you, I have a lot of hope for the future.
 About this vacation...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03c 1.ogg Mona: Although I'm only here because Fischl dragged me along, somewhere on the way, this turned into a wonderful summer.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03c 2.ogg Mona: To bear witness and to defend everyone's destiny... that's exactly what I try to do.
 You've done a great job.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03c 3.ogg Mona: Thank you. You too, of course... you've done a lot here.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03c 4.ogg Mona: I look forward to working with you again, hehe... I'm sure we will be even better partners.
 About this vacation...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03c 1.ogg Xinyan: It's been action-packed and awesome fun!
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03c 2.ogg Xinyan: I really have to thank you and that bard fella for the invitation.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03c 3.ogg Xinyan: I wonder how his live performances have been going... I owe him big time. I'll have to find a way to thank that guy in the future.
 Let's buy him a drink.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03c 4.ogg Xinyan: Sure! It's a deal!
 About your past...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03b 1.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Right, about that. After these events, I suppose I've bid a formal farewell to my past.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03b 2.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Don't worry, I feel just as fine as I did during the times before. I am burdened by neither grief nor regret.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03b 3.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I appreciate these twists of fate from the bottom of my heart.
 You're always so chill...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03b 4.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Thank you. Can I take it as a compliment?
 Certainly.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03b 5.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I'm so happy to have a friend like you.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03b 6.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Let's shift our focus back to the scenery in front of us and take a good look at the clouds and waves before we leave.
 About your scryglass...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03a 1.ogg Mona: *sigh* It's really quite frustrating. Lately, my scryglass has been acting up whenever something major occurs.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03a 2.ogg Mona: ...It's as if it's deliberately trying to stop me from seeing how things will end.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03a 3.ogg Mona: Hold on... I hope you didn't bring that up just to poke fun at me?
 Although what?
 Certainly.
 Do you want to chat?
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 02a.ogg Fischl: Why, certainly. I bestow upon thee permission to ask any questions.

 Knowing you, that shouldn't be a problem.
 Let's buy him a drink.

 Not at all.
 Okie dokie!
Media:vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 03a.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Then it's decided. I'll go gather some more fruit. And for seasoning... Yup, that should do it.

 Paimon, come with me!

 Step DescriptionTo find out the truth, everyone returns to the location of the mysterious machine to investigate. There, they find Persikov's manuscript...
 That's good.
 That's the Mona I know!
 Who are you?
 You mean Klee's camp.
 You're always so chill...
 You've done a great job.
 Yup. He's destined for greatness.
(Traveler): ("Meet in another place"... But when, and where?)
(Traveler): (...What did she mean...)
(Traveler): (Did his mental state deteriorate, or did Kazuha knock him out...?)
(Traveler): (That reminds me, there's one unanswered question on these islands. But the group is unaware.)
(Traveler): (That voice...!)
(Traveler): (The researcher came to his senses briefly after Kazuha's throw, but soon fell unconscious...)
(Traveler): (The voice has faded... Was she directly speaking into my mind?)
Dodocommunication Device: Dodoco! Dodoco!
Everyone sits around the campfire, chatting and cooking barbecue.
Everyone takes out their water bottles and empties them over the collapsed Fatui researcher...
Kazuha stands quietly for a while, then throws the researcher over his shoulder and onto the ground.

Media:vo dialog yqeq114 oz 01a.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein eagerly anticipates your comments.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 01.ogg Xinyan: I've got some new inspiration for a song...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 02a.ogg Xinyan: Sure, I'd love to.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 02b.ogg Xinyan: Okay, make sure to take it easy.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03a 1.ogg Xinyan: I am going to share this adventure with my friends when I get back. Who knows, it may even give Yun Jin some new ideas for her opera.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03a 2.ogg Xinyan: As for Xiangling, I'm sure she'll come up with a bunch of suggestions the minute that anything cooking-related comes up.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03a 3.ogg Xinyan: You know her, a true professional, she knows everything... Like how to make a good stew without a pot. That's something I'd like to learn from her...
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03a 4.ogg Xinyan: I need to learn some new dishes before my new friends come to visit. Oh, and Roasted Lavender Melons is definitely gonna be one of them!
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03b 1.ogg Xinyan: Are you a little disappointed that I didn't play any rock music back in my mirage?
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03b 2.ogg Xinyan: Whew, glad to hear it.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03b 3.ogg Xinyan: Rock 'n' roll is my first love, that'll never change.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03b 4.ogg Xinyan: But music is also a vehicle for all kinds of emotions. Rather than only expressing my own feelings, I figured what I did was more suitable for the occasion.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03b 5.ogg Xinyan: Hehe, perhaps now, I can call you a kindred spirit in our understanding of music.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03c 1.ogg Xinyan: It's been action-packed and awesome fun!
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03c 2.ogg Xinyan: I really have to thank you and that bard fella for the invitation.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03c 3.ogg Xinyan: I wonder how his live performances have been going... I owe him big time. I'll have to find a way to thank that guy in the future.
Media:vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03c 4.ogg Xinyan: Sure! It's a deal!
Media:vo yqeq114 1 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: What a drunkard, hmph.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: Cleanse him with the holy spring of punishment!
Media:vo yqeq114 1 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: Manuscript? Where is it?
Media:vo yqeq114 1 fischl 04.ogg Fischl: Hmph! Then I'll...
Media:vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I've checked the surroundings, but there's no one else here.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Isn't that strange? The Fatui is a big organization, but he is the only one left at this camp. What's more, we didn't even see him the last time we were here.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Even the larger gentleman from the first time is missing. I think... they must be hiding somewhere.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: As for why they may be hiding, I'm afraid we'll have to ask him.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 05.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: He wasn't like this when we first met him. It looks like the effects have grown worse, to the point of driving him mad.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 06.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Allow me.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 07.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: ...
Media:vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 08.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Please excuse me!
Media:vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 09.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Haah!
Media:vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 10.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Can you tell me where you put the manuscript?
Media:vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 11.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Everyone, let's search the stone cracks nearby for the manuscript.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 mona 01.ogg Mona: I think he's referring to that machine.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 mona 02.ogg Mona: Excellent, please fan them away for me, too.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 mona 03.ogg Mona: Hey, are you one of the Fatui? Can you tell us what happened here and what that machine is for?
Media:vo yqeq114 1 mona 04.ogg Mona: Let me try.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 mona 05.ogg Mona: Kind sir, look at me. Now tell me, where did you hide your manuscript?
Media:vo yqeq114 1 oz 01.ogg Oz: Oh goodness, the smell of alcohol... Mein Fräulein, please allow me to fan the fumes away with my wings.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 oz 02.ogg Oz: Certainly.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 oz 03.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein means to splash him with water.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Hey, look! Isn't that the same guy we saw on our first day here?
Media:vo yqeq114 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: But he's as drunk as Tone-Deaf Bard... Should we wait for him to sober up?
Media:vo yqeq114 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Sounds like a good idea. Let's try!
Media:vo yqeq114 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hey, he opened his eyes!
Media:vo yqeq114 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Why is he crying? Looks like he has a lot of pent-up emotions...
Media:vo yqeq114 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Fischl, don't yell at him!
Media:vo yqeq114 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Ugh, he's completely lost in his own imagination...
Media:vo yqeq114 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Kazuha hesitated for a long time before making a move. He's so nice.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 01.ogg Researcher: Ahaha... *hic* Everyone's gone crazy. Everyone should get out of here!
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 02.ogg Researcher: We'll... We'll never wake up... But I was right, my precious, you are invincible... hehe...
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 03.ogg Researcher: A miracle machine... Definitely not... impossible... *hic*!
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 04.ogg Researcher: Hm... Huh?
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 05.ogg Researcher: ...F—Fatui...
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 06.ogg Researcher: ...Hah! Fatui!
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 07.ogg Researcher: Oh... those blockheads from the administration will regret it now! Haha! That's what you get for rejecting my research and forcing me to...
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 08.ogg Researcher: Forcing me to... to conduct my research on this deserted island... My precious! My precious... *sobs*
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 09.ogg Researcher: ...You mocked me... and my precious invention! You... you don't know anything about the future.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 10.ogg Researcher: Only my invention... can help us conquer the world! Haha... hahaha...
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 11.ogg Researcher: Idiots, such idiots, hahaha...
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 12.ogg Researcher: Ow! Don't hit me! I won't blow up the lab again... I'm sorry! I didn't mean to...
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 13.ogg Researcher: *sobs*... My manuscript, my manuscript! Only that... can save... save... *sobs*
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 14.ogg Researcher: Don't yell at me, don't yell at me... *sobs*
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 15.ogg Researcher: *sobs* No, no, don't force me to write a report... *sobs* Go away...
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 16.ogg Researcher: *sobs* Ow! My butt... *sobs* My brain is finally starting to work again... It's not a mushy mess anymore...
Media:vo yqeq114 1 persikov 17.ogg Researcher: The manuscript... the manuscript... is in the crack over there...
Media:vo yqeq114 1 xinyan 01.ogg Xinyan: Precious? What's his precious?
Media:vo yqeq114 1 xinyan 02.ogg Xinyan: This man's gone insane. There's no way we can communicate with him.
Media:vo yqeq114 1 xinyan 03.ogg Xinyan: Whew, finally! Otherwise, I was gonna have to blast some of my loudest rock 'n' roll in his ears.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Found it!
Media:vo yqeq114 2 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: Clearly. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been able to reproduce the god's power.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: It appears that the responsibility for this issue now falls to my retainers and I.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: How does the machine work?
Media:vo yqeq114 2 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I think that was where they were at the day we arrived on this island. Persikov was taking a strong Fatui soldier somewhere.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 01.ogg Mona: Let me see... Hmm...
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 02.ogg Mona: Just as I thought. This machinery named "Cognitive Mimicry" is capable of altering the state of people's brains. It was invented by the researcher we met earlier, his name is Persikov.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 03.ogg Mona: According to the manuscript, the Fatui officials did not support Persikov's research. They believed he had taken the wrong path.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 04.ogg Mona: But Persikov insisted on putting his machine to use. In order to achieve that, he disassembled the machine and used his connections to transport the parts to this deserted island.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 05.ogg Mona: Persikov was dead set on carrying out his experiments on this island. Most of his subjects were junior Fatui soldiers who all signed a waiver before the experiment.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 06.ogg Mona: ...It looks like they really thought this machine would benefit the Fatui.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 07.ogg Mona: That's most likely top-secret. The manuscript didn't reveal any details, but Persikov did mention that the machine was modeled after the power of a god.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 08.ogg Mona: Does that mean... there's a god connected to these dream-like mirages, and the Fatui found a way to research it?
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 09.ogg Mona: Anyway, Persikov's experiment did not go as planned. The machine broke down just days after it was activated. They tried to fix it, but...
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 10.ogg Mona: The technologically illiterate Fatui soldiers completely ruined the machine. Even its most important component of all — the crystalline cores — got ejected and disappeared.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 11.ogg Mona: Persikov may be a mad scientist, but he didn't want to see his subordinates suffer. Besides, if he didn't solve the problem, he would end up going insane as well.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 12.ogg Mona: As a last resort, Persikov went out on his own to look for the cores. But he was just a sickly researcher unfit for the task. He had to give up.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 13.ogg Mona: Then, Persikov went searching for the soldiers who had gone mad and strayed from the group, and took them to a hidden cave.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 14.ogg Mona: Yes. It took Persikov all of his strength to get all the missing soldiers into the cave. He tried to snap them out of it with music and poetry...
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 15.ogg Mona: But nothing worked.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 16.ogg Mona: There's good news and bad news written on the last few pages.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 17.ogg Mona: The good news is, Persikov managed to figure out the location of the crystalline cores by piecing together the snippets of information he could get from the delirious soldiers...
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 18.ogg Mona: The bad news is, Persikov failed to revive them, and eventually succumbed to the device's influence himself. The last few pages of the manuscript are just unintelligible drunken scribbles.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 mona 19.ogg Mona: There's a map in the manuscript. The markings should indicate the locations of the crystalline cores.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 oz 01.ogg Oz: Congratulations! We've found the key to solving the problem!
Media:vo yqeq114 2 oz 02.ogg Oz: A testament to the importance of maintenance in all aspects of life. I believe we can all learn something from this.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: How did they find this island? The Fatui's intelligence network's not to be underestimated.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We've got no choice but to find the crystalline cores now!
Media:vo yqeq114 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: This should be one of the crystalline cores mentioned in the manuscript!
Media:vo yqeq114 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: And here's the second one.
Media:vo yqeq114 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: We've found all the crystalline cores. Let's put them back into the machine!
Media:vo yqeq114 2 xinyan 01.ogg Xinyan: We came here once but there was no one around. Come to think of it, that must've been the day Persikov was busy gathering the soldiers into the cave.
Media:vo yqeq114 3 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Hmph! Apologize to me and my retainers at once!
Media:vo yqeq114 3 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Let's give it some time. Hopefully, it'll return to normal.
Media:vo yqeq114 3 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: It looks like we succeeded.
Media:vo yqeq114 3 mona 01.ogg Mona: I think so. That's what the manuscript says anyway.
Media:vo yqeq114 3 mona 02.ogg Mona: We could have had a nice, relaxing vacation, if all of this hadn't ended up occupying so much of our time.
Media:vo yqeq114 3 oz 01.ogg Oz: Then perhaps we should call it the Embassy of the Immernachtreich and Dodoland.
Media:vo yqeq114 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: We've inserted all the crystalline cores. Mona, is that all we needed to do?
Media:vo yqeq114 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We're the ones who fixed the device. Yeah, you're welcome!
Media:vo yqeq114 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yay! Let's get outta here then. Paimon wants to spend the rest of this vacation back at our own camp.
Media:vo yqeq114 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Yeah! But it feels like our camp now, kinda like our temporary home, hehe.
Media:vo yqeq114 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Huh? No! That's too many words. Paimon would prefer something easy to remember.
Media:vo yqeq114 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Come on, let's go home now.
Media:vo yqeq114 3 skirmishera 01.ogg Fatui Sergeant: Aah! Someone's in our camp!
Media:vo yqeq114 3 skirmishera 02.ogg Fatui Sergeant: Hold on, look at the machine... is it fixed?
Media:vo yqeq114 3 skirmishera 03.ogg Fatui Sergeant: Huh!? Oh no, oh no, I—I'm outta here...
Media:vo yqeq114 3 skirmisherb 01.ogg Fatui Recruit: Hey, who are you people!?
Media:vo yqeq114 3 skirmisherb 02.ogg Fatui Recruit: What? But Mr. Persikov is still lying on the ground over there.
Media:vo yqeq114 3 skirmisherb 03.ogg Fatui Recruit: Hey, hey! Don't leave me here on my own... Mr. Persikov's still there, we need to save him!
Media:vo yqeq114 3 xinyan 01.ogg Xinyan: Haha, those two definitely seem a little more lucid now.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Hehe, is the hospitality of the Immernachtreich to thy liking?
Media:vo yqeq114 4 fischl 02.ogg Fischl: May this place become an eternal paradise.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 fischl 03.ogg Fischl: Oh? If Lady Xinyan speaks so highly of it, then I must entertain the idea.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: (Traveler), I have a suggestion.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: There is a snack called Roasted Lavender Melon in Inazuma, which goes rather well with fish. Why don't we roast some fruit and seafood for dinner tonight?
Media:vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 03a.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Then it's decided. I'll go gather some more fruit. And for seasoning... Yup, that should do it.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 03b 1.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Haha, that's great.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 03b 2.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: You know, I want to follow your example and travel around the world. Hopefully, I can also make good friends along the way.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 03b 3.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: That means a lot coming from you, (Traveler).
Media:vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 03b.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Oh? Did you try it in Inazuma?
Media:vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I've noticed that, too. But considering it took some time for the mirages to appear, it may also take some time for them to disappear.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 05.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Do you think it's caused by the machine, or perhaps Persikov?
Media:vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 06.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I promised Fischl that I'd be her guard. I can help.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 mona 01.ogg Mona: Ah, you're all here.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 mona 02.ogg Mona: I've noticed an issue. Although we've fixed the machine, as you can see — the mirages on the islands have still not disappeared.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 mona 03.ogg Mona: Yes, that's definitely possible.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 mona 04.ogg Mona: In other news, my scryglass seems to be working fine now. The divination results are also looking about right, although...
Media:vo yqeq114 4 mona 05.ogg Mona: Although there are some parts in the results that I don't quite understand... it's as if there is some sort of power surrounding us, and it's still watching us.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 mona 06.ogg Mona: Sorry, I'm also not sure. All I know is that the power is not hostile at the moment. Whatever it is, it doesn't seem to harbor any ill will toward us.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 mona 07.ogg Mona: Well, although there's nothing left to disturb us, and we can finally kick back and enjoy our vacation, we still ought to be cautious while we're on these islands.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 mona 08.ogg Mona: I will keep seeing what the stars say every day.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 mona 09.ogg Mona: Good, I'll be counting on you.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 mona 10.ogg Mona: ...*sigh* Goodness knows why those girls are so carefree about everything. I suppose it falls to me to be extra vigilant.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 nahida 01.ogg ???: Now you have solved the mystery... doesn't it make you feel happy, satisfied?
Media:vo yqeq114 4 nahida 02.ogg ???: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. I'm just a little bird that sometimes flies by these islands, and am now watching you from far, far away.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 nahida 03.ogg ???: I just so happened to sense a power here that has something to do with me. I was curious, so I landed on the beach to quietly watch everything that took place on these islands.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 nahida 04.ogg ???: ...It was fascinating. The ones who came here to work were so busy, and yet I still saw genuine smiles on their faces from time to time.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 nahida 05.ogg ???: And then all of you arrived later on, bringing your glorious dreamscapes and wonderful willpower.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 nahida 06.ogg ???: Your dreams are like the pure and delicate bubbles floating on the water. The more beautiful the illusion, the more it fascinates me.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 nahida 07.ogg ???: I'm not able to travel myself, but I do admire free spirits like yourself. So I helped them design a little something for you all. I hope you liked it.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 nahida 08.ogg ???: As I said, I don't have an agenda. I'm just a little bird. I stopped here to admire your lives — joys, sorrows, and all.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 nahida 09.ogg ???: You are a special person, with a unique and brilliant glow. I decided to communicate with you in this way because I'm really curious about you.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 nahida 10.ogg ???: There is no need to wonder about my name. Maybe one day in the future, we will meet in another place.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 nahida 11.ogg ???: When that time comes, I think you'll be able to recognize me. Hehe.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 oz 01.ogg Oz: Wonderful. Mein Fräulein invited you all here not only to witness the arrival of our Holy Land, but most importantly, she wished that you could all relax and enjoy the summer.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 oz 01b.ogg Oz: In mein Fräulein's mind, it is a treasured memento of this journey. She is positively thrilled to know that you also see it as such.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 oz 01c.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein cried when she bade farewell to everyone.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 oz 02.ogg Oz: Mein Fräulein says she hopes to go on more adventures with you here in the future.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: *yawn* Whew! After coming home to a nice big meal then having a long lie down, Paimon's finally starting to feel relaxed.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon's loving it!
Media:vo yqeq114 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Oh, coming!
Media:vo yqeq114 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Ohh, so we're gonna call the Tone-Deaf Bard, right?
Media:vo yqeq114 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Nope! Tone-Deaf Bard, a whole bunch of really strange things happened!
Media:vo yqeq114 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: So judging from your tone, it sounds like you don't know any more about this than we do?
Media:vo yqeq114 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Ugh, so annoying...
Media:vo yqeq114 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: We did! We ate a lot of yummy food and saw loads of amazing things. It was really cool!
Media:vo yqeq114 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Hmm, Tone-Deaf Bard is right...
Media:vo yqeq114 4 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: If Tone-Deaf Bard thinks it's okay, then maybe there's nothing to worry about.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: After all, Tone-Deaf Bard is still a god. We should probably trust him.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Let's head back, we don't wanna keep everyone waiting.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Hold on, didn't Fischl say earlier that she's going to catch some crabs? Paimon wants to go too!
Media:vo yqeq114 4 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Hey, what are you doing? The crabs don't catch themselves!
Media:vo yqeq114 4 venti 01.ogg Venti: Well hello there, strangers! You finally called! I thought you were having so much fun that you'd completely forgotten about me.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 venti 02.ogg Venti: A strange machine that can imitate the power of a God? Wow, haha, I didn't know the Fatui had plans like that. Their imaginations are truly running wild.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 venti 03.ogg Venti: Alas, I am but a humble bard who sings for his Mora in the tavern. Why would I know anything about it?
Media:vo yqeq114 4 venti 04.ogg Venti: But, other than that, did you two have fun?
Media:vo yqeq114 4 venti 05.ogg Venti: Hehe, that's good.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 venti 06.ogg Venti: The point of traveling is to record any feelings stirred along the way. As long as you had an unforgettable experience, this journey has served its purpose.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 venti 07.ogg Venti: As for the mysterious voice, although we don't know who it was, not only did she not harm you, she also helped you to gain a better understanding of each other, right?
Media:vo yqeq114 4 venti 08.ogg Venti: If you look at it that way, maybe she meant you well. I mean, if she was able to intercept Alice's communication tool, I'm sure she's also plenty capable of attacking you.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 venti 09.ogg Venti: Hahaha, I'm glad to bring you some peace of mind. Just enjoy your vacation to the fullest, and don't forget to tell me all about the marvelous mirages when you get back.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 venti 10.ogg Venti: I want to record all these beautiful memories, and turn them into ballads. Every summer will become an unforgettable song.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 venti 11.ogg Venti: Then I'll just wait for your return, (Traveler). Happy vacationing!
Media:vo yqeq114 4 xinyan 01.ogg Xinyan: Great! Well, I've come to the right place — I love it here!
Media:vo yqeq114 4 xinyan 02.ogg Xinyan: Of course! And you should come find me in Liyue when you get the time. I'll show you around.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 xinyan 03.ogg Xinyan: Oh, also, my friend runs the best restaurant in Liyue. I'm sure you'll love it.
Media:vo yqeq114 4 xinyan 04.ogg Xinyan: If you're into opera, you should go see Yun Jin. She's the nicest person, and she likes making friends with new and interesting people. I'm sure the two of you will have plenty to talk about with your shared passion for theatrics.
Mona takes the manuscript and studies it carefully...
Once the machine is fixed, the situation seems to improve. Soon, you hear footsteps approaching...
You tell Venti everything that has happened on the islands over the past few days...
