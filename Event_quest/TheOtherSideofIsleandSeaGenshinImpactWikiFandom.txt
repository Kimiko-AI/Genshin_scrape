 ...What does that mean, exactly?
 A change in state...
 Are you willing to help us out?
Sayid: Of course, I have never rejected the opportunity to study the unknown.
 Here are the ones we recorded down.
 Let's rope a researcher into this business, shall we?
Paimon: Hmm, that would be best. But where would we find one...
 Perhaps we should put up a commission at the Adventurers' Guild.
Paimon: Hey! If we do that, and the murals turn out to be clues to some treasure, aren't we just giving it up for free?
Paimon: That won't do! Let's look for... oh, let's go look for a researcher and get them to help us out!
 Quest DescriptionYou discover a strange mural on one of the islands in the Golden Apple Archipelago. Perhaps this archipelago is home to more of these murals...
 Thank you.
Sayid: It was nothing. In fact, I have always been interested in this sort of research.
 We can pay you.
Sayid: Hahaha. From the look of things, you must be highly-experienced adventurers.
Sayid: However, I would say that these stories of the unknown are the greatest possible remuneration for me. You need not pay me anything else.
 Well here's what happened...
 Why did they have to use murals, though?
Sayid: Sometimes, images are most intuitive than language when it comes to recording and transmitting information.
(If this is the first mural you've found)
Paimon: Hmm? Look, there' some sort of... drawing on this stone.
Paimon: It looks like people are getting ready to board a ship.
(If this is the first mural you've found)
Paimon: Hmm? Look, there's some sort of... drawing on this stone.
(If this is the first mural you've found)
Paimon: Hmm? Look, there's some sort of... drawing on this stone.
Paimon: Looks like a ship with lots of people on it... meeting a disaster at sea...
(If this is the first mural you've found)
Paimon: Hmm? Look, there's some sort of... drawing on this stone.
Paimon: This one seems to show a mountain... with a special symbol on it.
Paimon: Paimon's not totally sure what it means, but let's record this mural down first.
(Otherwise)
Paimon: Huh, Paimon didn't think we'd find a mural here, too...
Paimon: It looks like it shows people getting ready to board a ship.
(Otherwise)
Paimon: Look! Over here! There's a mural here too!
(Otherwise)
Paimon: Looks like we've found another mural.
Paimon: This mural looks like it has some special meaning.
Paimon: Looks like the marking is right on top of that mountain. Should we go have a look? Who knows, maybe we'll find something.
(Otherwise)
Paimon: Ooh! Here's another mural!
Paimon: Looks like a ship with lots of people on it... meeting lots of huge waves...
(Otherwise)
Paimon: Over here! There's a mural here as well!
(Otherwise, if obtained Illegible Notes)
Paimon: Looks like we've found another mural.
Paimon: This one seems to show a mountain... with a special symbol on it.
Paimon: Paimon's not totally sure what it means, but let's record this mural down first.
Paimon: Are you a researcher?
Paimon: But we can't be sure how they're related...
Paimon: Hey! If we do that, and the murals turn out to be clues to some treasure, aren't we just giving it up for free?
Paimon: Hmm, that would be best. But where would we find one...
Paimon: Hmm? Look, there' some sort of... drawing on this stone.
Paimon: Hmm? Look, there's some sort of... drawing on this stone.
Paimon: Huh, Paimon didn't think we'd find a mural here, too...
Paimon: It looks like it shows people getting ready to board a ship.
Paimon: It looks like people are getting ready to board a ship.
Paimon: Let's go back there and try our luck, shall we?
Paimon: Let's look around and see what we can find!
Paimon: Look! Over here! There's a mural here too!
Paimon: Looks like a broken ship... and one group of people saving another...
Paimon: Looks like a ship with lots of people on it... meeting a disaster at sea...
Paimon: Looks like a ship with lots of people on it... meeting lots of huge waves...
Paimon: Looks like the marking is right on top of that mountain. Should we go have a look? Who knows, maybe we'll find something.
Paimon: Looks like we've found another mural.
Paimon: Maybe that journal and the mural were left by the same group of people!
Paimon: Maybe there might be similar murals on the surrounding islands nearby...
Paimon: Ooh! Here's another mural!
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon's heard people say that you can normally find researchers in the library, right?
Paimon: Over here! There's a mural here as well!
Paimon: Paimon can't read this very well... Either way, let's make of note of this mural first, shall we?
Paimon: Paimon doesn't know what all this means, but let's record this mural down first.
Paimon: Paimon wonders what story these murals record...
Paimon: Paimon's not totally sure what it means, but let's record this mural down first.
Paimon: Still, it feels as though these murals are hiding some other message. If only we could get someone to help us decipher it...
Paimon: Still, we can't make complete sense out of the story these murals depict just by looking at them.
Paimon: That won't do! Let's look for... oh, let's go look for a researcher and get them to help us out!
Paimon: The more Paimon looks at these five things, the more they look like cups with water in them.
Paimon: They must have left this island. Let's hope that their voyage went smoothly this time...
Paimon: This group of people must have saved another group on this island.
Paimon: This mark... looks like the same spot that was on the journal we found.
Paimon: This mural looks like it has some special meaning.
Paimon: This mural looks like it's trying to mark something out.
Paimon: This mural... feels like it has something to do with that pool on the mountaintop.
Paimon: This one seems to show a mountain... with a special symbol on it.
Paimon: Well, let's record it down anyway.
Paimon: Well, we've recorded all these murals down. If we connect them, we should be able to put the pieces together.
Paimon: What's this... looks like five... pillars? Or are those five cups of water? Paimon wonders which it is...
Paimon: When these people got shipwrecked, they must have first stayed on this island.
Paimon: Who knew that we'd find a mural like this one on this island?
Paimon: Who knows, we might just find the researcher we need there!
Sayid examines the murals carefully...
Sayid: After they were shipwrecked, they must have drifted to the island where you encountered the murals.
Sayid: After yet another shipwreck, the island welcomed some new "guests."
Sayid: As for this mural, it shows five objects with five different markings within them.
(Shows Broken Isle Mural)
Sayid: Finally, we come to this one. Clearly, they found some way to leave this island and thus departed.
(Shows Nameless Islet Mural)
Sayid: First, we have this mural, which depicts a group of people who were shipwrecked.
(Shows Minacious Isle Mural)
Sayid: Haha, I suppose I count. Strictly speaking, I am a "wandering scholar," but I suppose that is merely just a subset of "researcher."
Sayid: Hahaha. From the look of things, you must be highly-experienced adventurers.
Sayid: Hello, friend. Is there anything I can do for you?
Sayid: Here, I'm sure you can observe that this mountain has been specially marked out.
Sayid: Hmm. The contents depicted by these murals are not difficult to decipher in and of themselves. I cannot quite put them all in order yet, but I think there should be no problem if we just tried to understand them one by one.
Sayid: However, I cannot guess what this "something" is exactly...
Sayid: However, I would say that these stories of the unknown are the greatest possible remuneration for me. You need not pay me anything else.
Sayid: I suspect this place must have been important to these people.
Sayid: Islands out at sea... and murals you found there. How fascinating.
Sayid: It was nothing. In fact, I have always been interested in this sort of research.
Sayid: Just like five cups of water, with each containing a different amount of it.
Sayid: Next, let's look at this mural.
(Shows Nameless Island Mural)
Sayid: Now then, let's not delay. Could I have a look at those murals?
Sayid: Of course, I have never rejected the opportunity to study the unknown.
Sayid: Oh, not bad, not bad at all.  My apologies, please give me a moment to think...
Sayid: Perhaps I should take some time out to walk around outside...
Sayid: Perhaps this particular shipwreck meant something unusual to the people who wound up on this island.
Sayid: So you're looking for a researcher who can help you decipher those murals, I gather?
Sayid: Sometimes, images are most intuitive than language when it comes to recording and transmitting information.
Sayid: Still, if this island is in the middle of the ocean, then this "something" could always be "seawater."
Sayid: Thank you for bringing me this story and these murals. I never thought that I would encounter such things in Mondstadt.
Sayid: The first mural only hints at their situation, but this mural goes into a lot of detail as to the wrecked ship.
Sayid: The story the murals tell should be as such.
Sayid: Then we come to this mural.
(Shows Twinning Isle Mural)
Sayid: They then stayed on that island.
Sayid: This should be the first batch of people attempting to rescue the second. Also, if you'll have a look at the wreckage depicted here...
Sayid: This sort of artwork usually hints at the change in state of something.
Sayid: Well, then. Have you encountered a problem that you need a "researcher" to help solve?
You and Paimon explain the process of recording the murals to Sayid...
