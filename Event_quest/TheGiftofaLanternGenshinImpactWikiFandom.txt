 ...I remember.
 Certainly.
 Goodbye.
 Happy Lantern Rite.
 He definitely will be able to see it.
 I'm sorry, you must've mistaken me for someone else...
 It sure will.
 Lead the way.
 Leave it to me.
 Let me hang it up.
 Not at all.
 Of course I do.
 Quest DescriptionMs. Bai from Qingce Village seems to be making some preparations...
 We brought you a Xiao Lantern.
 What about you...
 Yes, I have them right here.
 You're most welcome.
Jiangcheng: Ah, sure. Dear... don't forget to look after our land...
Jiangcheng: Ah... Ms. Bai... Of course I remember you, Ms. Bai! Your father was telling me how proud he is for you not so long ago...
Jiangcheng: Alright, just be careful. Don't hurt yourself...
Jiangcheng: Dear, come have a word with Ms. Bai... Her father is such a skilled craftsman...
Jiangcheng: Did you hang the Xiao Lantern? Truly breathtaking. The upcoming year is bound to be another great one.
Jiangcheng: Do you remember, Dear? I used to make great Xiao Lanterns back in the day. Our neighbors liked them so much that they asked me to make some for them, too.
Jiangcheng: Eh... When was that? ...Dear, perhaps you remember...
Jiangcheng: Ha! Just like I said, there's nothing wrong with my memory... And, and...
Jiangcheng: Haha... Sounds about right! Your father's Tofu is the pride of Qingce Village...
Jiangcheng: I see... Young people like you always have something to do... Can't get a moment's respite...
Jiangcheng: I was just telling you that, with such a huge festival just around the corner, maybe we should get some new clothes for our daughter...
Jiangcheng: Is it you, dear? Are you back?
Jiangcheng: It's you, Ms. Bai... Has your father been well?
Jiangcheng: Nonsense, I haven't lost my senses... How could I not recognize my own wife...
Jiangcheng: Oh, I see you've brought a guest... A seamstress! Once again, you've read my mind!
Jiangcheng: Right! Ms. Bai, I forgot to ask what brought you here...
Jiangcheng: They sell their Tofu in Liyue Harbor, it's top-quality!
Jiangcheng: What a pretty Xiao Lantern! The upcoming year is bound to be as great as this one.
Jiangcheng: Xiao Lantern... Ah... So considerate. You bring me those each year, Ms. Bai...
Jiangcheng: Xiao Lanterns are so beautiful, they really light up each Lantern Rite... Wait, I'll hang it for you...
Jiangcheng: Xiao Lanterns... Xiao Lanterns... Such a wonderful sight...
Ms. Bai: Alright. Then let us go to his place first.
Ms. Bai: But I guess we should look to return to normal now... I should see to the elderly folk in the village. I'm meant to go see Jiangcheng today.
Ms. Bai: But I hope... he'll be able to see it.
Ms. Bai: But with your help, we were able to have a lively Lantern Rite this time.
Ms. Bai: Grandpa Jiangcheng, it's me, Ms. Bai! I brought you some Tofu the other day, surely you haven't forgotten me already?
Ms. Bai: Grandpa Jiangcheng, it's time for us to leave now. We still have a few errands to run. I'll visit you again soon.
Ms. Bai: Grandpa Jiangcheng, why don't you take some rest? No need to strain yourself...
Ms. Bai: Have you gathered the materials yet?
Ms. Bai: How do you do, Traveler? Thanks for your help last time. Qingce Village hasn't been this lively in a while now.
Ms. Bai: I didn't want to leave Grandpa Jiangcheng on his own right before the festival...
Ms. Bai: I don't know if it makes sense, but doing the same things he used to do, being in the same environment, it makes me very nostalgic.
Ms. Bai: I inherited the mill when my father passed away. I left my job at Liyue Harbor to continue the family tradition.
Ms. Bai: I often recall the many things that my father used to tell me, especially during this time of the year...
Ms. Bai: I really appreciate it.
Ms. Bai: I used to release Xiao Lanterns together with my father. When I'm done making this one, I'll have to release it on my own.
Ms. Bai: I'm afraid I won't get everything done in time if I go looking for materials now... Traveler, would you mind collecting some for me?
Ms. Bai: I'm really grateful for your help. If I'd gone there on my own, it would've taken me hours to get everything done.
Ms. Bai: If you don't mind, could you come along with us?
Ms. Bai: In previous years, only Zhi and I were around, so we could only make the children a few Xiao Lanterns, talk to the old folks about some domestic business, and whip up a few good dishes...
Ms. Bai: Me... I'm going back to the mill. There's still much work to be done.
Ms. Bai: Oh, I almost forgot. With Grandpa Jiangcheng on my mind, I didn't make a Xiao Lantern for myself.
Ms. Bai: Thank you so much. I wish you Happy Lantern Rite.
Ms. Bai: Thank you so much. I'll make myself a Xiao Lantern later.
Ms. Bai: Thank you.
Ms. Bai: Thank you.
(After giving the Xiao Lantern materials)
Ms. Bai: The problem is I didn't leave any spare materials either...
Ms. Bai: Traveler, could you hang the Xiao Lantern now? I'll look after Grandpa Jiangcheng.
Ms. Bai: Traveler, how about you help Grandpa Jiangcheng clean the house? I'll keep him company in the meantime.
Ms. Bai: Uh... He... He's doing fine. The mill is still very much in business. The city folk from Liyue Harbor often come to the village just to buy our Tofu.
Paimon: This house should pass the white glove test now! Let's go check on Ms. Bai and Grandpa Jiangcheng...
Paimon: Uh, let's go back and join them.
