 Did your stomach just rumble?
 Don't even think about putting your hands on it!
 I thought you'd forgotten about it.
 I told Sucrose about the sword, my bad.
 I want to eat!
 I wouldn't call her a kid if I were your size.
 I wouldn't have expected that. Is it because I'm too powerful?
 I'll do what I can to help.
 I'm as surprised as you.
 I'm grateful for the faith he puts in me.
 I'm hungry!
 Isn't that just what young people do in general?
 I—I also got into a fight, I'm sorry...
 Let's keep a low profile. We can't let Albedo know.
 My investigation was successful.
 Of course, I wouldn't hand it over to them!
 Quest DescriptionMany unexpected things have happened on this mountain. A mysterious hidden camp, suddenly-appearing thieves, uninvited enemies... This sword seems to have brought you into the thick of all this weirdness. So long as it remains in your hands, trouble will always follow in its wake — with such troubles including those who have come to take the sword, and new monsters heretofore unseen.
 Sucrose didn't mean to cause trouble. Don't be too hard on her.
 The situation looks worse than expected...
 This is Albedo's secret.
 This is the answer you seek.
 We fought with Fatui.
 We should find a place hidden from view.
 We'll take him back down.
 What do you think, Paimon?
 Yeah, you could say that.
 You flatter me.
After telling Sucrose the story about the sword...
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: I heard the ruckus and came over to check. So it was you who made all this noise.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: What happened? Did you get into a fight?
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Aren't you supposed to be organizing documents? Why did you come here all of a sudden?
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: And you got into a fight with such a dangerous opponent — in this terrain...
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: Huh, I reckon you've been led astray by yet another thing that attracted your attention.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: You told her everything?
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: *sigh* Never mind. We couldn't have kept her in the dark for too long anyway.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: Sucrose is naturally drawn to obscure knowledge and mystery. She is great alchemist material, indeed.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: It's not trouble that worries me, I'm only concerned with your safety. You must be more careful next time.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: *sigh* Anyway, what's going on with that adventurer crouching over there?
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: Sure.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: That girl... Let her out of your sight, and she winds up in the strangest places...
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 13a.ogg Albedo: True.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 13b.ogg Albedo: Don't worry, I'm not angry.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 14.ogg Albedo: Huh? Another change...
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 15.ogg Albedo: The sword's power is much stronger than before. How did that happen?
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 16.ogg Albedo: So it's the energy it's never encountered before...
Media:vo eqxs004 10 albedo 17.ogg Albedo: It caused the sword to greatly grow in strength.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Well, now even Paimon feels guilty...
Media:vo eqxs004 10 paimon 02.ogg Paimon:  We just told her about the sword's properties and origin. We didn't let her touch it! We know better than that~
Media:vo eqxs004 10 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: He must've caught a cold during the fight.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Sucrose may seem a bit rigid, but she's a good kid with a heart of gold.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Can't disagree.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Huh? There seems to be a shiny thingy on the sword.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: There were some ferocious characters among those Fatui soldiers. We've never seen them before.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 recklesspallad 01.ogg Reckless Pallad: I'm.... I'm freezing...
Media:vo eqxs004 10 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: M—Mr. Albedo... I didn't mean to...
Media:vo eqxs004 10 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Uh... Ah... I only... I'm sorry, I was just passing by.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Ah... Uh... I promise I won't be causing trouble anymore. I swear on the quadruple-size Sweet Flower seeds I just propagated!
Media:vo eqxs004 10 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: I took it upon myself to protect Mr. Pallad during the battle. He should be alright.
Media:vo eqxs004 10 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: Ahhhh, I didn't consider that possibility... It's my oversight, my apologies!
Media:vo eqxs004 10 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: Mr. Albedo, I'll check on him!
Media:vo eqxs004 11 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: In position! Prepare for battle!
Media:vo eqxs004 11 recklesspallad 01.ogg Reckless Pallad: Ahhhh!? W—What is it!?
Media:vo eqxs004 12 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: The dragon's power... the dragon's life force can revive withered plants and empower them to such a degree...
Media:vo eqxs004 12 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Inconcievable!
Media:vo eqxs004 12 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Most probably it's because the sword fell to the ground. The impact must've caused its power to leak out.
Media:vo eqxs004 12 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: *sigh*
Media:vo eqxs004 12 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: This Cryo Regisvine having originally withered up and died here... Is it because it hadn't been able to absorb the ambient corruption?
Media:vo eqxs004 12 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: After you purified the corruption, the resulting pure elemental energy not only revived it, but also enhanced it.
Media:vo eqxs004 12 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: Pure life force will cause it to constantly regenerate itself... together with its fighting spirit.
Media:vo eqxs004 12 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: I also haven't encountered any similar incidents.
Media:vo eqxs004 12 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: Yet I must admit that a phenomenon of this rarity, although unexpected, is a valuable discovery.
Media:vo eqxs004 12 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: Sucrose.
Media:vo eqxs004 12 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: Keep an eye on that adventurer. Take him back to the camp.
Media:vo eqxs004 12 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: As for the matters at hand, I beg your pardon, Traveler... but I must ask for your further assitance.
Media:vo eqxs004 12 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: How could a dead tree stump turn out to be such a monster!?
Media:vo eqxs004 12 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Paimon almost got swallowed!
Media:vo eqxs004 12 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Anyway, why hasn't anything like that happened before?
Media:vo eqxs004 12 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Such an unexpected mess, and we're the only ones who can clean it up. *sigh* It must be because we keep outdoing ourselves!
Media:vo eqxs004 12 recklesspallad 01.ogg Reckless Pallad: It's my fault! Don't make me leave! I beg you!
Media:vo eqxs004 12 recklesspallad 02.ogg Reckless Pallad: I promise I'll stay put!
Media:vo eqxs004 12 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Ah, Mr. Pallad... There's no need to go into a fetal position...
Media:vo eqxs004 12 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: Ah, yes!
Media:vo eqxs004 12 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Yes sir!
Media:vo eqxs004 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Albedo! We're baaaack!
Media:vo eqxs004 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Huh? It seems that he's not here.
Media:vo eqxs004 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Is he out investigating something? Or maybe he went to make some mysterious drawings?
Media:vo eqxs004 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Oh, if it isn't Sucrose! What are you doing here?
Media:vo eqxs004 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: You tell time very accurately! Are you a human clock?
Media:vo eqxs004 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: That wasn't a compliment...
Media:vo eqxs004 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's been over a week since we talked about it.
Media:vo eqxs004 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: How can your sense of time be so strong and so weak at the same time...?
Media:vo eqxs004 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Umm.... Telling her shouldn't really matter.
Media:vo eqxs004 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: She can take a look, too. Just no touching...
Media:vo eqxs004 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: It's a super powerful sword. Don't touch it with your bare hands!
Media:vo eqxs004 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Hehe, look all you want! Not sure why, but even Paimon feels a strange sense of achievement.
Media:vo eqxs004 2 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Is it such a distinct feeling?
Media:vo eqxs004 2 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Okay, okay, we got it.
Media:vo eqxs004 2 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Let's look around for the right spot!
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Ah! It's you!
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: I'm in the final stage of my research. I have five hours and twenty-six minutes of leisure time today.
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: So I here looking for you to inquire about previously discussed matters.
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: No, no, it's nothing worth your praise. You're too kind...
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: C—Can I ask you a question, Traveler? I made a request regarding investigating Mr. Albedo's secret. Have you made any progress?
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: What...!?
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: O—Over a week? I clearly... Ah!
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: I've been so absorbed in my research. That matter of ours had completely slipped my mind...
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: S—So! Do you know what it is?
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 10.ogg Sucrose: That's great. Could you tell me?
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 11.ogg Sucrose: Wait. What are you talking about?
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 12.ogg Sucrose: What's this?
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 13.ogg Sucrose: Uh... This is...
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 14.ogg Sucrose: Ah! Th—This is... I've never seen...
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 15.ogg Sucrose: Astounding! It's the first time I've heard of such a mysterious weapon.
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 16.ogg Sucrose: I can faintly feel the power coursing through the sword... It's like a living creature.
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 17.ogg Sucrose: This may due to my alchemist training.
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 18.ogg Sucrose: I don't dare to say anything for sure, but the "flow" of power is very noticeable. Although this description isn't the most precise... N—NormaIIy, I wouldn't define things like that...
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 19.ogg Sucrose: Please. believe me! I don't usually use such ambiguous terms!
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 20.ogg Sucrose: Traveler, could you use this sword in battle?
Media:vo eqxs004 2 sucrose 21.ogg Sucrose: I'd like to learn more about it, but I'm unable to use it myself. I can only ask for your assistance.
Media:vo eqxs004 5 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Well, Paimon thinks that's one of your own special qualities, not the sword's...
Media:vo eqxs004 5 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Well, you've earned his trust with your abilities.
Media:vo eqxs004 5 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: A flash of brilliance often doesn't make sense. For example, Paimon's appetite for Sticky Honey Roast!
Media:vo eqxs004 5 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Don't so shy! Just say what's on vour mind!
Media:vo eqxs004 5 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Let Paimon help you out: Paimon's hungry! We should grab something to eat!
Media:vo eqxs004 5 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Nothing to be ashamed of! Admitting that you're hungry just makes the food taste better.
Media:vo eqxs004 5 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: Of course! Let's get moving! There must be some food back at the camp~
Media:vo eqxs004 5 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: It'd be lovely to have some Sticky Honey Roast to keep us warm in this icy weather.
Media:vo eqxs004 5 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Remarkable! This weapon is like no other...
Media:vo eqxs004 5 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: You're also extraordinary. No matter if it's your fighting stance or the momentum of your swing, it's perfect.
Media:vo eqxs004 5 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: This sword is special. I didn't want to go too deep into the research, and yet I couldn't take my eyes off of it.
Media:vo eqxs004 5 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: Clearly this is a mysterious yet dangerous and enticing sword.
Media:vo eqxs004 5 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: Mr. Albedo must have great confidence in you to have entrusted you,with such an important item.
Media:vo eqxs004 5 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: I agree with Paimon.
Media:vo eqxs004 5 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: Howeverr, the sword hadn't absorbed much energy before it was handed to you... Huh, how did Mr. Albedo recognize its uniqueness among a pile of other items in storage?
Media:vo eqxs004 5 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: Ah... Which reminds me, I didn't eat much today.
Media:vo eqxs004 5 sucrose 09.ogg Sucrose: I went looking for you right after completing my experiment. Then, on the way, I ran into an adventurer in the snow. I spent quite some time saving him...
Media:vo eqxs004 5 sucrose 11.ogg Sucrose: Ah... Ahhhh! N—No, it's not like that...
Media:vo eqxs004 5 sucrose 12.ogg Sucrose: Um, um...
Media:vo eqxs004 5 sucrose 13.ogg Sucrose: I'm... I'm hungry. I could really go for a...
Media:vo eqxs004 5 sucrose 14.ogg Sucrose: Oh... ah... I'm just a little embarassed...
Media:vo eqxs004 5 sucrose 15.ogg Sucrose: Huh, is that so?
Media:vo eqxs004 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Isn't that the hotheaded adventurer from Mondstadt? Did he come here with Cyrus to explore the Snowy Mountain, too?
Media:vo eqxs004 7 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Even if we can't, we won't just leave him here, right?
Media:vo eqxs004 7 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ah! The Fatui strike again!
Media:vo eqxs004 7 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: That't the spirit! Let's knock 'em down!
Media:vo eqxs004 7 recklesspallad 01.ogg Reckless Pallad: U—Ugh... Argh...
Media:vo eqxs004 7 recklesspallad 02.ogg Reckless Pallad: I'm f—f—f—freezing, ACHOO!
Media:vo eqxs004 7 recklesspallad 03.ogg Reckless Pallad: I wanted to leave, b—but I got lost. I'm sorry...
Media:vo eqxs004 7 recklesspallad 04.ogg Reckless Pallad: U—Ugh... It's so c—cold that I c—can't move...
Media:vo eqxs004 7 sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: M—Mr. Pallad!?
Media:vo eqxs004 7 sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: You still haven't gone back?
Media:vo eqxs004 7 sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Have you been here since I rescued you from the snow pit!?
Media:vo eqxs004 7 sucrose 04.ogg Sucrose: Mr. Pallad, a trip to this mountain requires solid preparation. You shouldrh't have treated it so lightly.
Media:vo eqxs004 7 sucrose 05.ogg Sucrose: I'd appreciate the assistance. I'm afraid that, in his current state, he won't be able to walk on his own...
Media:vo eqxs004 7 sucrose 06.ogg Sucrose: You're right... My apologies, Traveler. I'm sure he feels bad about the situation.
Media:vo eqxs004 7 sucrose 07.ogg Sucrose: No! Please, don't give them the sword.
Media:vo eqxs004 7 sucrose 08.ogg Sucrose: Mr. Pallad, I'll take you to a safe place! Quickly!
(Sucrose and Reckless Pallad run off)
Media:vo eqxs004 7 vadim 01.ogg ???: He's the least of your concerns right now. You should be worried about yourself!
Media:vo eqxs004 7 vadim 02.ogg Vadim: You must've already figured out why we're here.
Media:vo eqxs004 7 vadim 03.ogg Vadim: We won't let you go unless you give us that sword.
Media:vo eqxs004 7 vadim 04.ogg Vadim: So naive! We won't let any witness escape!
Media:vo eqxs004 7 vadim 05.ogg Vadim: This sword will make a fine gift for Her Excellency, Harbinger Signora!
(A fight ensues)
Media:vo eqxs004 cs albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Wait!
Media:vo eqxs004 cs hero 01.ogg Media:vo eqxs004 cs heroine 01.ogg Traveler: Watch out!
(Pallad runs into the Traveler and the sword hits the ground, causing a Cryo Regisvine to revive)
Media:vo eqxs004 cs recklesspallad 01.ogg Reckless Pallad: S—So cold...
Media:vo eqxs004 cs recklesspallad 02.ogg Reckless Pallad: Ah, ah... Fire?
(Pallad pushes Sucrose aside and runs towards the sword)
Media:vo eqxs004 cs recklesspallad 03.ogg Reckless Pallad: F—Fire! ...Warmth!
Media:vo eqxs004 cs recklesspallad 04.ogg Reckless Pallad: Huh... Ahhhh!
Media:vo eqxs004 cs sucrose 01.ogg Sucrose: Hold on just a little longer!
Media:vo eqxs004 cs sucrose 02.ogg Sucrose: That Regisvine...
Media:vo eqxs004 cs sucrose 03.ogg Sucrose: Was brought back to life!
Sucrose: *rumbling*
