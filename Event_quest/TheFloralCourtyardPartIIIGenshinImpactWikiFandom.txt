Fushizome: As such, I've made some small changes to today's theme to perhaps help open up a new line of thought for your consideration.
Fushizome: Considering your talent, I believe that you merely need to give the theme due consideration.
Fushizome: Hehe, there's no need to fret. Just relax. Relax...
