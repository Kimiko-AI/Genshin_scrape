 And the "Extreme Beetle Brawl" is a wrap!
 Everyone's happy, that's all that matters.
 I still wouldn't really call that resting, per se.
 It's a win-win situation!
 Quest DescriptionThe Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl appears to have been a great success, and it's now time to return to the brawl grounds to check on Arataki Itto and Grandmaster Hanakado...
 The Onikabuto must be exhausted...
 The arena must be about to collapse...
 Time to celebrate!
Boss:
By my estimations, you should have met up by now, so have fun... Just remember to eat your meals on time.
Having heard that you're also an avid beetle brawler, the kid was quite eager to meet you. He even said that he'd consider joining the Arataki Gang if you turned out to be better than him at beetle fights. I gave him the addresses of some of your usual haunts so that he can find you himself.
I have yet to complete my business, so I won't be back for a while. Should you have any new ideas and want to drag the boys into new shenanigans, hold your horses first. I'll help you organize matters once I get back.
I met a kid while harvesting Lavender Melons. He's articulate and well-mannered, and he loves beetle battles. He even has lots of friends in that department.
I'll repeat myself again: just relax and stick to beetle battles for now! Don't drag the gang around on some wild adventure or anything!
Letter from Kuki Shinobu
Media:vo gdceq002 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: So the Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl seems to be going pretty smoothly.
Media:vo gdceq002 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Paimon's curious who's really stronger between them. Let's go "chuck" it out, shall we?
Media:vo gdceq002 2 akira 01.ogg Akira: Boss, Boss! There's a letter from Shinobu. Take a look at this...
Media:vo gdceq002 2 akira 02.ogg Akira: Huh? Where'd the Boss go? He was beetle fighting right here just a moment ago...
Media:vo gdceq002 2 akira 03.ogg Akira: Well, it's not urgent, just a little unexpected...
Media:vo gdceq002 2 akira 04.ogg Akira: You can read it for yourself if you want.

Media:vo gdceq002 2 hanakadogyokushou 01.ogg Grandmaster Hanakado: Hahahahaha...
Media:vo gdceq002 2 hanakadogyokushou 02.ogg Grandmaster Hanakado: Astounding!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 hanakadogyokushou 03.ogg Grandmaster Hanakado: Even though your fighting style differs greatly from mine, I resonate strongly with the passion you imbue into your Onikabuto.
Media:vo gdceq002 2 hanakadogyokushou 04.ogg Grandmaster Hanakado: In time, you shall surely become a true champion of the beetle-fighting world.
Media:vo gdceq002 2 hanakadogyokushou 05.ogg Grandmaster Hanakado: No, I won 571 rounds, so I'm ahead. Also, you have the home advantage. Taking that into account, it is in fact I who am the superior warrior.
Media:vo gdceq002 2 hanakadogyokushou 06.ogg Grandmaster Hanakado: That suits me just fine. Follow me.
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Hahahahaha...
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 02.ogg Arataki Itto: Amazing!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 03.ogg Arataki Itto: You're pretty good yourself! You managed to win an impressive 570 out of our 1,141 matches!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 04.ogg Arataki Itto: Of all the beetle-battle marathons I've fought in my time, you've lasted the longest by far! Not gonna lie, I'm impressed!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 05.ogg Arataki Itto: Huh? Why you gotta be so stubborn? I remember our score clear as day, and Mamoru is our witness!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 06.ogg Arataki Itto: Ain't that right, Mamoru?
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 07.ogg Arataki Itto: Fine! Since I'm a generous guy, I can give you one round, no problemo. I'll just defeat you next time!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 08.ogg Arataki Itto: And if you're still not convinced, we'll do the next battle on your home turf. I'll prove that it's about the beetle fighter, not the location!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 09.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh? Hey, compadre, Flying Lavender Melon, you're finally here!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 10.ogg Arataki Itto: Uh, never mind that for now! Here's your 2-month free ramen voucher, as agreed. Take it!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 11.ogg Arataki Itto: Oh, no, no, no, no. This was just the warmup. The Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl is still to come!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 12.ogg Arataki Itto: After all, things are way too quiet without an audience. We can't just end the event like this!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 13.ogg Arataki Itto: But the good news is, Grandmaster Hanakado finally let go of his pride and admitted that I'm a strong beetle fighter!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 14.ogg Arataki Itto: Still, we ain't done with each other just yet. I'll be heading to his home turf alone soon, where I'm gonna defeat him once and for all.
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 15.ogg Arataki Itto: Once that happens, he'll have to follow my orders — and by that, I mean he'll help us make the Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl the biggest, baddest event ever!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 itto 16.ogg Arataki Itto: Thanks again to the two of you. Now, wait here — I'll be back with good news in no time at all!
(Itto runs off)
Media:vo gdceq002 2 mamoru 01.ogg Mamoru: Boss, I... I really can't take it anymore... Please let me sleep for a while...
Media:vo gdceq002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Uhh... Have they been going at it this whole time without a break!?
Media:vo gdceq002 2 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wait a minute, why's Paimon back to Flying Lavender Melon again? Does Paimon only get a good nickname when she's fighting for you?
Media:vo gdceq002 2 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Ramen voucher? Oh yeah, right! The ramen!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Now that's more like it!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Bull-Chucker sure seems like he's having fun, and we got two months' worth of ramen out of it, hee-hee!
Media:vo gdceq002 2 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Uh, is it urgent? Because Bull-Chucker just left with Grandmaster Hanakado. They said they were going to continue their battle...
Media:vo gdceq002 2 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: What the... So Grandmaster Hanakado is actually part of the Arataki Gang? But his... communication style made Bull-Chucker feel like he was facing a mortal enemy...
Media:vo gdceq002 2 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Just as Shinobu expected, Bull-Chucker is spending all his time beetle fighting without resting or eating.
Media:vo gdceq002 2 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: But he did get us to organize the Beetle Brawl event for him...
Media:vo gdceq002 2 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Y'know, Paimon thinks Shinobu deserves to enjoy the ramen voucher more than we do! Why don't we take her for ramen when she gets back?
Media:vo gdceq002 2 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Hmm... Actually, wait a moment.
Media:vo gdceq002 2 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Bull-Chucker didn't tell us which ramen stall this voucher's meant to be used at...
Media:vo gdceq002 2 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: ...Are we supposed to find the store by ourselves!?

Media:vo gdceq003 6 hanakadogyokushou 01.ogg Grandmaster Hanakado: I see. I see... Let us battle once more. This time, I'll see through all of your methods.
Media:vo gdceq003 6 hanakadogyokushou 02.ogg Grandmaster Hanakado: Victory and defeat no longer seem so important... Let's just battle for fun, shall we?
Media:vo gdceq003 6 hanakadogyokushou 03.ogg Grandmaster Hanakado: It's rare that I should find such a great opponent. It would be a shame to end our battles so soon, would it not?
Media:vo gdceq003 6 itto 01.ogg Arataki Itto: Sure! Bring it on!
Media:vo gdceq003 6 itto 02.ogg Arataki Itto: But seeing through my secret beetle-fighting techniques? Nah, little fella, that ain't gonna happen!
Media:vo gdceq003 6 itto 03.ogg Arataki Itto: If you'll admit that I'm the stronger beetle fighter, I'll fight you for as many rounds as you want!
Media:vo gdceq003 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh, looks like Bull-Chucker and Grandmaster Hanakado are still raring to go... Well, let's leave them to it! They can battle beetles till the beetle-battling's done!
