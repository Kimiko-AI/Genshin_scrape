 Are you sure that you can deal with the risks?
Qingzhou: Well, I will bring a guard with me, naturally — just in case.
 It might be difficult to hire someone right now.
Qingzhou: Um... hmm. Yes, that's... You make a good question, my liege.
(Friendship Improved, +1 heart)
 But if you were to fall into a slumber...
Qingzhou: Of this you need not fret, my liege. I shall show the utmost restraint. Yet, if the meteorites do indeed consign people to slumber, one wonders what they dream of...
Qingzhou: Yes, how very curious... Ahem! I was merely theorizing. Do not worry, I will not put myself at such a risk.
(No change)
 Can you guarantee that you won't touch them?
 Got it.
 I have them right here.
 Inspiration doesn't guarantee good execution.
Qingzhou: Haha, Now, I do not mean to brag, my liege. But though I, Qingzhou, may lack talent, I have still published many a popular verse. You need not worry on my behalf.
 Is something the matter?
 It might be difficult to hire someone right now.
 Just promise me you won't touch those meteorites...
Qingzhou: I—I... Alright, I promise. Come now, why would I put myself in harm's way when I know that touching them may put me in an unending slumber?
Qingzhou: Yet, one wonders what those consigned to such torpor by the meteorites might dream of...
Qingzhou: *coughs* I—I was just joking! Please help me deal with those monsters.
 Mist Flowers, perhaps?
Qingzhou: Mist Flowers. Hmm... There could be potential in comparing the falling meteorites to Mist Flowers.
Qingzhou: May I ask you to help me gather three Mist Flowers? Perhaps having such objects close at hand may light my path.
 Sure.
Qingzhou: You have my utmost thanks, my liege.
 Not everything you write has to shock the world, right?
Qingzhou: You speak truly — the best verses are divinely inspired, and the finest hands are guided by chance. And yet, this verse has plagued me for far too long. I must continue it somehow...
 Okay.
Qingzhou: Wonderful! Most splendid! I shall be depending on you, then.
 Quest DescriptionQingzhou has found a muse in the rain of meteorites, and simply must go to the place where they made landfall to compose a verse or two...
 Sure.
 That's good...
 The Silk Flower, perhaps?
Qingzhou: That seems a fair choice. Even with the skies as they are, the Silk Flowers still bloom as they always have.
Qingzhou: There may be some values in juxtaposing the two...
Qingzhou: Could you gather three Silk Flowers for me, then? Perhaps having the objects close at hand may light my path.
 Got it.
Qingzhou: You have my utmost thanks, my liege.
 There are monsters near those meteorites.
Qingzhou: Haha, of course. I have traversed many a place in Liyue, and have seen many a foul beast. If the road is indeed too dangerous, then I shall just hire a guard.
 There's a better way to view those meteorites.
Qingzhou: A better way, you say? ...Hmm, you do have a point. If I but gaze into the meteor's fame, but ignore all that surrounds it, would that not be overly narrow of me?
(Friendship Improved, +1 heart)
 Th—That might not be appropriate...
 Will looking at a meteorite really inspire you?
Qingzhou: Ah, you think too little of me, my liege. Were I to gaze upon one, I would surely write you a fine verse.
 You can write poetry from here, can't you?
Qingzhou: That simply won't do, my liege. If I stay cloistered and safe all my life, then what would the poems I write be, if not the groans of the healthy, or the pontifications of a fool?
 You'll be knocked unconscious if you touch those meteorites...
 You...
 Your writing's pretty good already.
Qingzhou: I am unworthy of such praise. But alas, how can a poet live with themselves if they cannot write poetry?
Qingzhou: *coughs* I—I was just joking! Please help me deal with those monsters.
Qingzhou: *sigh* Inspiration is indeed hard to come by...
Qingzhou: A better way, you say? ...Hmm, you do have a point. If I but gaze into the meteor's fame, but ignore all that surrounds it, would that not be overly narrow of me?
Qingzhou: A poet's worst nightmare is to have eyes for one thing only. If I were to merely observe those meteorites, I doubt that anything good should come from my brush.
Qingzhou: Ah, I've heard tell of this. But if I but observe them up close, nothing untoward will befall me, yes?
Qingzhou: Ah, you think too little of me, my liege. Were I to gaze upon one, I would surely write you a fine verse.
Qingzhou: And then... Hmm, wait. With so many monsters on the road, and no one to accompany me...
Qingzhou: As to whether we should approach the crash site or not, allow me to give it a little more consideration...
(Proceed to Branch 1 or Branch 2 depending on whether Qingzhou was convinced)
Qingzhou: But if I were to immediately go close to those meteorites, I fear I might be attracted by them only, thus missing the world around them.
Qingzhou: By some strange chance, I received a single strain of poetic inspiration of late, but I have yet to find a continuation worthy of its brilliance since...
Qingzhou: Could you gather three Silk Flowers for me, then? Perhaps having the objects close at hand may light my path.
Qingzhou: Excellent. I shall receive them gladly.
Qingzhou: Flowers and meteorites... Now that certainly is new.
Qingzhou: Haha, Now, I do not mean to brag, my liege. But though I, Qingzhou, may lack talent, I have still published many a popular verse. You need not worry on my behalf.
Qingzhou: Haha, of course. I have traversed many a place in Liyue, and have seen many a foul beast. If the road is indeed too dangerous, then I shall just hire a guard.
Qingzhou: Have you gathered the (Mist/Silk) Flowers?
Qingzhou: Hmm... It is said that outsiders see clearly, yes? Well then, Traveler, what sort of flower do you think I should [sic] as reference for composing my poem?
Qingzhou: Hmm... No, this verse will not do. It won't do at all. *sigh* I really must go and see for myself...
Qingzhou: How do you fare this day, my liege? My name is Qingzhou. I might add that I consider myself a poet, if I may be so bold.
Qingzhou: I am unworthy of such praise. But alas, how can a poet live with themselves if they cannot write poetry?
Qingzhou: I have given your words much thought, my liege, and valid are your concerns. I shall not risk myself unnecessarily by seeking those meteorites out.
Qingzhou: I have given your words much thought, my liege, but the meteorites are too rare a sight to be missed. I will go nonetheless.
Qingzhou: I have heard your advice, my liege, and I will heed it.
Qingzhou: It came to my mind that if I were to gain some inspiration from observing one such meteorites  [sic] up close, that next, elusive sentence in my poem may yet surface...
Qingzhou: I—I... Alright, I promise. Come now, why would I put myself in harm's way when I know that touching them may put me in an unending slumber?
Qingzhou: May I ask you to help me gather three Mist Flowers? Perhaps having such objects close at hand may light my path.
Qingzhou: Mist Flowers. Hmm... There could be potential in comparing the falling meteorites to Mist Flowers.
Qingzhou: Not appropriate? Whatever might you mean by that?
Qingzhou: Of this you need not fret, my liege. I shall show the utmost restraint. Yet, if the meteorites do indeed consign people to slumber, one wonders what they dream of...
Qingzhou: Recently, the skies have been strange, and meteorites have fallen in flame to the earth. It is truly a rare sight to see on this mortal plane.
Qingzhou: So I shall first observe them from afar, taking in the surroundings, before moving in for a closer look...
Qingzhou: That seems a fair choice. Even with the skies as they are, the Silk Flowers still bloom as they always have.
Qingzhou: That simply won't do, my liege. If I stay cloistered and safe all my life, then what would the poems I write be, if not the groans of the healthy, or the pontifications of a fool?
Qingzhou: There may be some values in juxtaposing the two...
Qingzhou: Traveler, perhaps you might be so kind as to dispose of the monsters that might bar our path?
Qingzhou: Um... hmm. Yes, that's... You make a good question, my liege.
Qingzhou: We may be able to compose a fine verse from a flower or some other small object. Yet the number of poems written in praise of flora are many indeed...
Qingzhou: Well, I will bring a guard with me, naturally — just in case.
Qingzhou: What are you referring to as "inappropriate"?
Qingzhou: What's more, a unique stroke does not good poetry make. It is in the many fine details that one's broader quality may be judged.
Qingzhou: Wonderful! Most splendid! I shall be depending on you, then.
Qingzhou: W—Well, I shall exercise restraint.
Qingzhou: Yes, how very curious... Ahem! I was merely theorizing. Do not worry, I will not put myself at such a risk.
Qingzhou: Yet, one wonders what those consigned to such torpor by the meteorites might dream of...
Qingzhou: You have my thanks, my liege. This gift is unworthy by comparison, but do accept it.
Qingzhou: You have my utmost thanks, my liege.
Qingzhou: You speak truly — the best verses are divinely inspired, and the finest hands are guided by chance. And yet, this verse has plagued me for far too long. I must continue it somehow...
