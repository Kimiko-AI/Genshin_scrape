Hello
Heyah!
I had a big lunch. Lots of meat. Mm, I'm happy.
I have iron claws and teeth of thunder. I protect you.
I have no human family. I am a wolf.
I keep watch. You leave, you call me.
I kill you!
I like lupical. I like the woods. I like my friend. I like to run!
I like meat and I like potatoes.
I like the stars at night. So many stars. In the sky, in the lake. And in the city.
I taste blood...
I'll scout ahead.
I'll watch your back.
I'm hungry. Let's hunt.
If you're scared of lightning, hide now.

My lupical is my only family. But I don't have four legs, not like them. Because I'm not a real wolf. Sometimes this makes me sad.
No!
Oh, Varka is... a name. That man big. Big steelclaw, Razor's name - Varka gave him. Oh... want to see him.

Talking makes me tired. Talking is hard. But I have to try.
Teeth. Claws. Legs. All bigger. All stronger! To protect you.
The sun is up. Time to hunt.
The wind... bites hard.
The wolves are my Lupical. My family.
These things... useful?
Today is your day. You were born on this day, many moons ago. I want to make you happy today. Can we eat meat together?
Varka? Razor doesn't know...
Vision helps Razor... fight with lightning tooth! Protect lupical!
Wake up!
We're going to hunt!
When I run with you, when I hunt with you, I am happy. With you, I am not a wolf, I am not a boy, I am just me. I am Razor. Because you are my friend. You are my Lupical. I hope you feel happy, too!
