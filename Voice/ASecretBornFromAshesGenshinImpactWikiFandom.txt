 (!!!)
 (...!?)
 (Wait, his neck!?)
 ...
 ...No, it's fine.
 A gigantic version of Joel...
 After the whopperflowers eat someone...
 All's well that ends well.
 And then adopt their newfound identity.
 Don't mention it.
 Don't say that! You're not a monster, you're my friend.
 He purposely erased it?
 Hmm?
 How did you feel when you took out the impostor?
 I really have no stake in this either way.
 I'll treasure it.
 I'm glad you're finally reunited...
 I'm glad you're okay...
 Is he... Joel's father?
 Maybe I'm just really tough, I don't know.
 Ooh, in that case, I would add some horror elements in...
 After the whopperflowers eat someone...
 They would turn into that person!
 Quest DescriptionYou return to Dragonspine with your tale to meet Albedo at the encampment. The hitherto unknown secret may yet lie buried on this mysterious and perilous snowy mountain...
 So what's your story?
 Thank you, Eula.
 There's no "us" in this situation, Paimon.
 They would turn into that person!
 We are all delighted for you.
 Yes, Paimon is truly frightening.
 Your neck...
(Traveler): (...)
(Traveler): (...I see, that makes a lot of sense.)
(Traveler): (A gardener...)
(Traveler): (I didn't expect Albedo to joke about this. Doesn't he care about what the mark means?)
(Traveler): (So it WAS a prank!)
(Traveler): (The mark is back... Is this a prank!?)
(Traveler): (These are real events. Albedo is trying to tell me the cruel and unbelievable truth.)
(Traveler): (This is not just a story...)
Media:vo dialog eqxs105 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Go ahead. You're one of their instructors, no?
Media:vo dialog eqxs105 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: Dragonspine is too cold for ordinary fruit trees to survive. But...
Media:vo dialog eqxs105 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: If, one day, Dragonspine did become home to gardens and orchards, there would be more reasons for people to visit. Perhaps, a little life is the key to attracting people.
Media:vo dialog eqxs105 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: Life may exist in all kinds of unfathomable forms and in all manner of unthinkable environments. Mysterious, yet tenacious... Perhaps this is what makes life so special.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: Traveler, Paimon.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: I suppose your story is ready.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: No need. I am also ready to tell my story.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: Please, go ahead.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: Oh, truly frightening.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: In other words, the whopperflowers would ambush and then completely replace their victims.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: It's a good story. May I write it down? I may bring it up in future conversations.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: Yes.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: Mine is a little longer than yours. It starts with an alchemist.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: A great alchemist once created Subject One. Subject One was her proudest achievement, and successfully blended into human society. No one ever would have thought that this friend of theirs was in fact a synthetic human.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: However, unbeknownst to Subject One, the alchemist had tried the same experiment many times before he had come into being. Some of the rejects from failed experiments had been discarded, but had not died.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: Subject Two was one such failed experiment. He was swallowed by a great dragon that came to rest upon a snowswept mountain. Many years later, he was resurrected by the dragon's mysterious power.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 13.ogg Albedo: He saw all kinds of people on the mountain, including... Subject One, who had somehow, miraculously, blended in among them.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 14.ogg Albedo: Never in Subject Two's wildest imagination had he thought it possible for experimental life forms such as they to deceive everyone so successfully. He saw the way humans accepted Subject One as a friend, witnessed their affection as they addressed him by name.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 15.ogg Albedo: This was what Subject Two wanted. Now, all that Subject Two desired was to replace Subject One and take the joy of his existence for himself.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 16.ogg Albedo: Subject Two began to unfold his plan. He stole Subject One's books and notes and studied all that Subject One had learned from the alchemist. Subject Two was highly intelligent and he learned quickly.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 17.ogg Albedo: He changed his face into an exact replica of Subject One's face. Then, he found a plant with mimicry capabilities and transformed it using dragon blood and alchemy.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 18.ogg Albedo: And so, not only did Subject Two transform his own appearance to perfectly match that of Subject One, he also created a third entity: Subject Three.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 19.ogg Albedo: But Subject Two wanted to become a perfected human. So, he erased the mark on both his and Subject Three's necks, for these marks were symbols of imperfection.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 20.ogg Albedo: In my view, it was probably a subconscious act. An instinct.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 21.ogg Albedo: He so desperately craved to become a perfect human being that he forgot something: Human beings are defined by their flaws.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 22.ogg Albedo: Subject Two's plan was meticulously crafted. Subject Three would draw Subject One's attention. After Subject One disposed of Subject Three, he would assume the threat had now disappeared, and would let his guard down.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 23.ogg Albedo: The next moment that Subject One was alone, Subject Two would make his move. He would eliminate Subject One and become the only one remaining.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 24.ogg Albedo: He would secretly replace the Subject One of everyone's memories, and inherit his identity, residence, clothing, sword, name, and friends.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 25.ogg Albedo: People would have no idea that the individual they knew had become somebody else from one day to the next.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 26.ogg Albedo: But just before Subject Two could carry out his plan, a unique stranger entered the mix. Subject Two tried to make contact with this person, but found that they could somehow sense he was different from Subject One.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 27.ogg Albedo: What's wrong? Are you scared?
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 28.ogg Albedo: He became a new stage in Subject Two's plan. One more person that Subject Two had to dispose of.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 29.ogg Albedo: It's as if there were three identical roses in a garden. Only one of the three was a fine specimen, while the other two were defective specimens that bore poisonous thorns.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 30.ogg Albedo: In all the world, only the gardener who tended to them could tell which was the good specimen.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 31.ogg Albedo: People do not like poisonous plants. Only a perfect rose can fetch a high price. If the inferior specimens wanted to conceal the fact of their worthlessness, they would have to take the gardener out of the picture using their poisonous thorns.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 32.ogg Albedo: This is exactly what Subject Two was thinking. So he hid in the shadows and waited patiently. Maybe soon, he would get his chance to become truly human.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 33.ogg Albedo: Fortunately, it is just a story, and even in this story, Subject Two did not succeed. But you can never let your guard down on Dragonspine.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 34.ogg Albedo: Monsters mutated with Durin's power and blood are also creatures of Rhinedottir, just like me. You must beware of all such creatures.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 35.ogg Albedo: I'm glad to hear that. It's okay. I know what I am. You and I are both "different," so there is no need for me to hide the truth from you.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 36.ogg Albedo: The only thing is that sometimes, when I think about how mighty the power of alchemy is, I feel so small.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 37.ogg Albedo: As beings who set foot in this world, how arrogant are we in desiring to control our destiny, and in desiring to create?
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 38.ogg Albedo: Is creation an arrogant act, Traveler? If not, why do we call the ones that created us and control us, "gods"?
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 39.ogg Albedo: If it is, then what qualifies us to call ourselves creators? How far must we take our reverence and respect, and what purpose does it serve?
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 40.ogg Albedo: Nothing special. But...
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 41.ogg Albedo: ...Whenever I think about it, I feel a twinge of grief.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 albedo 42.ogg Albedo: Then I won't keep you. I have some things to attend to here, so forgive me for not seeing you down.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 ambor 01.ogg ???: Helloooo! Traveler! Are you here?
Media:vo eqxs105 1 ambor 02.ogg Amber: We're here to deliver a message from Cyrus. There's gonna be a big event down at the base camp, and they want you there too, Traveler.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 ambor 03.ogg Amber: Don't worry about it! There've been no issues getting up and down the mountain recently.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 eula 01.ogg Eula: Thought we might find you here.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 eula 02.ogg Eula: Winter camp is nearing its end. Apparently, even provisional instructors are required to attend.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 eula 03.ogg Eula: Is everyone ready? Let's not keep them waiting.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Guess what? Paimon's story is finished! Let's go see Albedo again!
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Albedo!
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Yup yup! How about you? Do you need some more time?
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Paimon calls dibs! Paimon first!
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Okay, here goes!
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Once upon a time, there was an evil researcher who went into the mountains and did a crazy experiment on whopperflowers to transform their appearance. After a lot of pain and suffering, the whopperflowers finally took on a human form. Then, they stood by the side of the mountain to wait for unsuspecting bypassers...
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: To whoever spoke to them, they would ask some questions, such as: "Who am I?" "Who are you?"
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: If the bypasser got the wrong answer... The last sound they'd make would be a "yelp" before the whopperflower ate them alive in one bite!
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: What the... You two aren't scared at all!
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Don't go nitpicking, okay! If you didn't like the story, go write your own.
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: And then what? Go back to where the person lives? Enter their home!? Eat their whole family!? Aaaah!!!
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Huh, Paimon made up this story, but now Paimon's the one who's scared by it...
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: What for? Just to scare people with?
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: You've got a real mean streak, Albedo!
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 15.ogg Paimon: Uhhh... Th—This is giving Paimon the chills. It's so scary...
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 16.ogg Paimon: What!? There's three of them now!?
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 17.ogg Paimon: Uhh, uhh, this is way too scary... Paimon's never gonna be able to trust anyone again...
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 18.ogg Paimon: ...
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 19.ogg Paimon: What happened then? What happened to the stranger?
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 20.ogg Paimon: Whew, that was intense. So what happened after that? Did Subject Two's plan succeed? Uhh, Paimon can't bear thinking about it...
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 21.ogg Paimon: Poor Albedo...
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 22.ogg Paimon: Hey, is that Amber?
Media:vo eqxs105 1 paimon 23.ogg Paimon: Looks like we need to go, Albedo. Bye for now.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 ambor 01.ogg Amber: Allow me to introduce Joserf. He's Joel's father.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 ambor 02.ogg Amber: Pallad is the hero of the hour this time! Go on, Pallad, tell us what happened in your own words.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 ambor 03.ogg Amber: Are you sure? This must be really important to you.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 bennett 01.ogg Bennett: Uh-oh...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 bennett 02.ogg Bennett: (Did my bad luck rub off on him when we ran into each other on the mountain?)
Media:vo eqxs105 3 bennett 03.ogg Bennett: (Uhh...)
Media:vo eqxs105 3 bennett 04.ogg Bennett: Huh...?
Media:vo eqxs105 3 bennett 05.ogg Bennett: Ah... This is good... This is good...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 bennett 06.ogg Bennett: I knew it! Urghh... I... I just...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 bennett 07.ogg Bennett: ...Pallad... Hehe, when did you become such a smooth talker, huh?
Media:vo eqxs105 3 cyrus 01.ogg Cyrus: Very well, very well... It's time for Pallad and I to have another discussion concerning his breaches of adventurer discipline.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 eula 01.ogg Eula: ...Oh, I can help with that. One moment.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 eula 02.ogg Eula: ...Here. Take this. It's powdered rime — just add it to your snowman, and it will never melt.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 eula 03.ogg Eula: Oh, I made this for you and Amber. Think of it as a winter souvenir.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 eula 04.ogg Eula: Come on, now, just take it. No need to make such a fuss.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 eula 05.ogg Eula: ...You're welcome. Just keep it, that's all I ask.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 eula 06.ogg Eula: Amber and I have some business to attend to now. See you later.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joel 01.ogg Joel: Dad! This is that traveler I was telling you about. The traveler's helped me out loads in the past, and this time we even built a snowman together.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joel 02.ogg Joel: Daddy...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joel 03.ogg Joel: Dad... I was so worried about you.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joel 04a.ogg Joel: Oh, yeah — I wanna say thank-you to the Traveler, Uncle Cyrus, Aunty Eula, and Aunty Amber. Thanks everyone.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joel 05.ogg Joel: You all helped look after me, and I'll always remember it.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joel 06.ogg Joel: But I guess I can't take the snowman with me, or it'll melt once it leaves Dragonspine... it's such a shame...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joel 07.ogg Joel: Wow! Really? This is awesome! You're the best, Aunty Eula!
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joel 08.ogg Joel: Dad, I have an unmeltable snowman now! Hahaha, how cool is that!
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joel 09.ogg Joel: Dad, I wanna go move the snowman. Can we do it now, please?
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joserf 01.ogg Joserf: Joel has told me everything about you. I can't thank you enough.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joserf 02.ogg Joserf: My memory has still not fully recovered, but Joel and his mother... they are the only ones that I will not... no, that I cannot forget.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joserf 03.ogg Joserf: Daddy's right here, Joel. Daddy's right here.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joserf 04.ogg Joserf: I'm sorry, I have no recollection. Maybe it's because of the head trauma? I'm not sure...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joserf 05.ogg Joserf: I woke up and found myself covered in blood. My things were gone and there was nothing to indicate who I was or how I got there.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joserf 06.ogg Joserf: I crawled into a cave and settled in for a slow recovery. After my legs and feet were a little better, my hunting skills were what kept me alive.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joserf 07.ogg Joserf: I'm alright now, Joel. Don't cry, daddy's not going anywhere. I'm here to stay.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joserf 08.ogg Joserf: How can I ever repay you all...?
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joserf 09.ogg Joserf: Thank you all. Thank you from the bottom of my heart...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 joserf 10.ogg Joserf: Okay. I'll be leaving with Joel now. I'm sure I'll see you all another day.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Huh? Who is this guy...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Wow, this is amazing!
Media:vo eqxs105 3 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Wait a second. Why is Cyrus discreetly wiping tears away, and what is Pallad doing here?
Media:vo eqxs105 3 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Why does this sound so hard to believe...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: Wow, so it was completely by chance, then.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Joserf, don't you remember anything else at all?
Media:vo eqxs105 3 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: The Boar Princess, feeding the foxes...?
Media:vo eqxs105 3 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: Huh? Eula?
Media:vo eqxs105 3 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: See you guys.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Wow, now our snowman won't melt either. Great!
Media:vo eqxs105 3 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: See you!
Media:vo eqxs105 3 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Everyone's gone. Seems like they've all got their own stuff to do now...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Oh! You know what? We've been on Dragonspine all this time, and somehow Paimon still forgot to ask Albedo about how to make a fruit jucifier machine that can keep the juice fresh... Ugh...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Maybe we should try Timaeus again. He does seem pretty eager to please, after all!
Media:vo eqxs105 3 recklesspallad 01.ogg Reckless Pallad: Okay... *clears throat*...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 recklesspallad 02.ogg Reckless Pallad: The weather was fine on that fateful day, and I had a feeling that lady luck was smiling down on me. So I trusted my gut and set off to explore somewhere new. Somewhere dangerous. Because where there is great danger, there is also great treasure.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 recklesspallad 03.ogg Reckless Pallad: But I had only been away from the group for a very short while, when...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 recklesspallad 04.ogg Reckless Pallad: I fell down a slope and just started rolling...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 recklesspallad 05.ogg Reckless Pallad: The place I fell to was somewhere I didn't recognize, and I'd sustained a few injuries. I remember thinking to myself: "This is the worst luck I've ever had in my whole life"...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 recklesspallad 06.ogg Reckless Pallad: ...Then I met Joserf. He'd heard the sound of me falling and came out to see what was going on!
Media:vo eqxs105 3 recklesspallad 07.ogg Reckless Pallad: I thought he must have been someone from the Adventurers' Guild here for the event. But after a few words of conversation, it was clear that he was having memory problems. He didn't even know his own name.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 recklesspallad 08.ogg Reckless Pallad: The temperature was freezing, and there was no time to deal with all that there and then, so I convinced him to come back to the camp with me and figure everything else out after we got there.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 recklesspallad 09.ogg Reckless Pallad: We got back to the camp, ran into Joel, and the moment he saw him, he froze for a second, with this completely stunned expression on his face, and then he started crying out: "Dad! Dad!" That's when Joserf suddenly started to remember.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 recklesspallad 10.ogg Reckless Pallad: You know what though, I definitely think my luck got worse after running into Bennett on the mountain.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 recklesspallad 11.ogg Reckless Pallad: No, no, I just meant, if it weren't for you, there's no way I ever would've run into Joserf on a mountain this huge!
Media:vo eqxs105 3 recklesspallad 12.ogg Reckless Pallad: Besides, we got back safely, didn't we? So don't blame yourself. Maybe sometimes miracles can only happen when you get just unlucky enough.
Media:vo eqxs105 3 recklesspallad 13.ogg Reckless Pallad: Huh? Am I? I—I was just... telling the truth...
Media:vo eqxs105 3 recklesspallad 14.ogg Reckless Pallad: Huh? B—But Cyrus... I think I kinda made up for my mistakes this time, y'know...
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 01.ogg Albedo: New research project, Timaeus?
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 02.ogg Albedo: We meet again.
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 03.ogg Albedo: Turning fruit into juice is not hard, but keeping it fresh is more difficult. But if you simply want to keep the fruit from rotting, there are many ways to achieve this.
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 04.ogg Albedo: Right, Traveler?
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 05.ogg Albedo: What's wrong? Is there something on my neck?
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 06.ogg Albedo: From the look on your face, it's as if you thought I had just played a practical joke on you that was in exceedingly poor taste.
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 07.ogg Albedo: Well, one way would be to bury your fruit on Dragonspine, where the snow never melts all year round.
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 08.ogg Albedo: You could always live on Dragonspine.
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 09.ogg Albedo: Or you can give the fruit to me, and I would take it to Dragonspine for you.
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 10.ogg Albedo: But since you don't like the cold, you'd have to send someone else to pick them up when you want them.
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 11.ogg Albedo: This is where you come in, Traveler.
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 12.ogg Albedo: Fruit buried on Dragonspine will stay fresh for much longer. However, it is also possible that the fruit will sprout and grow into fruit trees.
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 13.ogg Albedo: Who knows, maybe the next time you visit, it will have grown into an orchard. You can water the trees, add fertilizer, and when they finally bear fruit, you will have some fresh Sunsettias.
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 14.ogg Albedo: Oh?
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 15.ogg Albedo: I don't think being a gardener is so bad.
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 16.ogg Albedo: Hmm? It bothers you, does it?
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 17.ogg Albedo: Okay. But they're just Sunsettias. I think you are only so attached to them because you don't have much fruit of this quality in your possession.
Media:vo eqxs105 4 albedo 18.ogg Albedo: When someone's pockets are full and their spirit is fulfilled, they don't easily fall prey to this kind of yearning.
Media:vo eqxs105 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Timaeus!
Media:vo eqxs105 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: Timaeus, will you help us?
Media:vo eqxs105 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Nooo, but Paimon's Sunsettias are gonna go to waste without it!
Media:vo eqxs105 4 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Majorly important, that's what it is! If you can manage to invent this, we'll never have to worry about fruit going bad ever again!
Media:vo eqxs105 4 paimon 05.ogg Paimon: What about his neck?
Media:vo eqxs105 4 paimon 06.ogg Paimon: Albedo, you were saying? How do you stop fruit from going bad?
Media:vo eqxs105 4 paimon 07.ogg Paimon: But then Paimon won't be able to eat them!
Media:vo eqxs105 4 paimon 08.ogg Paimon: No, no, too cold for Paimon...
Media:vo eqxs105 4 paimon 09.ogg Paimon: Suddenly sounds a lot more feasible with other people doing all the work... Okay then! Shall we go with that idea?
Media:vo eqxs105 4 paimon 10.ogg Paimon: Ahhhh...!? No way!
Media:vo eqxs105 4 paimon 11.ogg Paimon: Then Paimon'll have to be a gardener. That's not the goal here!
Media:vo eqxs105 4 paimon 12.ogg Paimon: Albedo! Stop trying to get your hands on Paimon's super-sweet Sunsettias!
Media:vo eqxs105 4 paimon 13.ogg Paimon: Of course it bothers Paimon! They are the rarest super-duper sweetest Sunsettias ever. And they're not for you!
Media:vo eqxs105 4 paimon 14.ogg Paimon: Hmm? Really...?
Media:vo eqxs105 4 timaeus 01.ogg Timaeus: Traveler and Paimon. What can I do for you?
Media:vo eqxs105 4 timaeus 02.ogg Timaeus: Wait a minute... You've got that mischievous look on your face... you're not still thinking about that ridiculous juicer thing, are you!?
Media:vo eqxs105 4 timaeus 03.ogg Timaeus: Well, if the Traveler isn't really interested then, uh, maybe I'll give this one a pass... It's just the weirdest request ever...
Media:vo eqxs105 4 timaeus 04.ogg Timaeus: In the time it would take me to research something like that, I could probably pick those Sunsettias again ten times over...
Media:vo eqxs105 4 timaeus 05.ogg Timaeus: Albedo! Thank goodness. So the situation is, Paimon wants a machine that can turn fruit into juice and keep the juice fresh. I mean, surely it's—
Media:vo eqxs105 4 timaeus 06.ogg Timaeus: That's impossible! ...
