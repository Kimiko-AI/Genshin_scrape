 Quest DescriptionAfter touching the bonsai, everyone enters some kind of mysterious mirage — an old mansion where the long-forgotten past of a clan resurfaces... This place is intimately linked to Kaedehara Kazuha.
Media:vo yqeq103 1 oz 01.ogg Oz: As was the case last time, only Lord Kazuha is missing.
Media:vo yqeq103 1 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Wow, it's a new place!
Media:vo yqeq103 1 xinyan 01.ogg Xinyan: Don't worry, leave it to us!
Media:vo yqeq103 2 hisamichi 01.ogg Kaedehara Hisamichi: It is Kazuha's honor to duel with a military man like yourself. Kazuha, get ready.
Media:vo yqeq103 2 kageharu 01.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: ...This will do. Ah, Kazuha, you've come just at the right moment. What do you think of this rock carving?
Media:vo yqeq103 2 kageharu 02.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: I based it on a mountain scene I saw in a book. You know, there are nations in this world where the mountains reach all the way up into the clouds. If only I had the chance to see them with my own eyes...
Media:vo yqeq103 2 kageharu 03.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: That's not true. Though the Kaedehara Clan is far from what it used to be, I still bear all the same responsibilities as the clan heads before me.
Media:vo yqeq103 2 kageharu 04.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: But then again... continuing in the way of our forefathers, sacrificing everything for our declining clan... is it really worth it?
Media:vo yqeq103 2 kageharu 05.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: ...Kazuha, there's one thing I want you to always remember.
Media:vo yqeq103 2 kageharu 06.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: Family ties are important, but you ought to not let them hold you back.
Media:vo yqeq103 2 kageharu 07.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: Family only exists because of the people in it. If we are unhappy, how can we hope to build a joyful one?
Media:vo yqeq103 2 kageharu 08.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: The events of the past have had a profound impact on our family, but they are not your burden to carry.
Media:vo yqeq103 2 kageharu 09.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: ...If you ever grow tired of this tedious life, just drop everything and go off on a journey, see the world. Remember, Kazuha, don't let yourself get tied down in life.
Media:vo yqeq103 2 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: It's very intricate.
Media:vo yqeq103 2 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Father, you can go anywhere whenever you want.
Media:vo yqeq103 2 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: But I... I don't understand.
Media:vo yqeq103 2 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, father.
Media:vo yqeq103 2 soldier 01.ogg ???: I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Kaedehara. It's my honor to meet you today.
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kageharu 01.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: Kazuha, have you forgotten our promise?
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kageharu 02.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: Kazuha!
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kageharu 03.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: *sigh* ...Now you're blaming yourself for all of this... That's why I have failed you as a father.
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kageharu 04.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: The Kaedehara Clan has been paying the price for our past mistakes ever since your great-grandfather's generation. To this day, we have never fully recovered from it.
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kageharu 05.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: Though we are a family of bladesmiths, you don't have to devote your life to the family craft.
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kageharu 06.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: If a wounded animal wants to escape from a trap, it has to sacrifice the hind leg that was caught. You might think of this as a loss, but staying in the trap has far more deadly consequences.
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kageharu 07.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: Enough now, Kazuha. As the head of the family, I failed to revitalize our clan. You never blamed me for not giving you the life promised to you by our heritage, and I'm grateful enough for that.
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kageharu 08.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: All these generations of suffering... let's end them today. From now on, live your life with no burdens.
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kageharu 09.ogg Kaedehara Kageharu: Don't worry, I'll carry the blame for abandoning our family business.
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I'm sorry, but I just don't understand!
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: You really want to give it all up? But... but even if we're having a rough time, you still have me by your side! Can't I be of any help?
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: When you were my age, you were already helping grandfather out! Am I so incompetent that I'm a disappointment to you? Or...
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Father, please don't... You should not be to blame for not upholding our family name.
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kazuha 05.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Even if that day comes, let me share the burden with you.
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kazuha 06.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Let's just wait and see. Sooner or later, I will have to lead the Kaedehara Clan. When the time comes, I'll deal with all our problems.
Media:vo yqeq103 3 kazuha 07.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Did you really think it would be wise to pick a fight with the Kaedehara Clan?
Media:vo yqeq103 3 samurai 01.ogg ???: Hey, think you're tough enough to go against me? Ha, no response! What's wrong — you scared?
Media:vo yqeq103 4 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: The Kaedehara Clan is no longer what it used to be...
Media:vo yqeq103 4 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: That's Kazuha's voice!
Media:vo yqeq103 4 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: But... why can't he hear us?
Media:vo yqeq103 4 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Looks like it's just an illusion. This isn't the Kazuha who came here with us.
Media:vo yqeq103 5 kazuha 01.ogg Kazuha: Maybe if I were more adept in the sword arts, I'd be able to share my father's burdens...*sigh*
Media:vo yqeq103 5 kazuha 02.ogg Kazuha: This won't do... I'm getting distracted by family matters, and making too many mistakes.
Media:vo yqeq103 5 kazuha 03.ogg Kazuha: "I yearn to hear the song of nightingale, my patient ears ready to attend. A veil of mist obscures the western skies, into its midst a silver moon descends."
Media:vo yqeq103 5 kazuha 04.ogg Kazuha: To know one is fighting a losing battle, and yet never once falter... This shall be my father's legacy.
Media:vo yqeq103 6 fischl 01.ogg Fischl: Indeed, I most certainly agree.
Media:vo yqeq103 6 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Haha, yeah, it seems those are the rules.
Media:vo yqeq103 6 kazuha 02.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: The mood was more deflated, and the place more humbly furnished... yes, that makes sense.
Media:vo yqeq103 6 kazuha 03.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: What you saw was the Kaedehara Clan in decline.
Media:vo yqeq103 6 kazuha 04.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: That means I am older and wiser now. I am sorry you had to see my less mature former self.
Media:vo yqeq103 6 kazuha 05.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: For a long time after leaving Inazuma, I've lived the life of a drifter. But this is no bad thing, because I learned much from the experience.
Media:vo yqeq103 6 kazuha 06.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: I wish that I could've met my past self, too. If he saw me, I know that he would understand:
Media:vo yqeq103 6 kazuha 07.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Life is a long journey, and that's why I must travel far and wide.
Media:vo yqeq103 6 mona 01.ogg Mona: I can confirm that. His fate was a heavy burden indeed.
Media:vo yqeq103 6 oz 01.ogg Oz: Compared to the Lord Kazuha before us now, the mirage we saw appeared lost, with the burden of fate weighing heavily upon him.
Media:vo yqeq103 6 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: Thought we might find you trapped here again.
Media:vo yqeq103 6 paimon 02.ogg Paimon: We entered that maze in the mirage again, but the scene was different this time.
Media:vo yqeq103 6 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: We saw you in the mirage too, but you looked a little different than now.
Media:vo yqeq103 7 kazuha 01.ogg Kaedehara Kazuha: Just as I thought, the bonsai is the key to entering the mirage.
Media:vo yqeq103 7 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: C'mon, let's continue looking for the rock garden.
You tell Kazuha what you saw...
