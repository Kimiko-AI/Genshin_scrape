 Quest DescriptionAfter passing through The Moon-Bathed Deep, you come to a land that is foreign to you. You see no sign of any civilization at all, and so you decide to investigate further.
Paimon: Alrighty then, (Traveler). Let's head in. Steadily now...
Paimon: And where there's writing and paper, there'll be those... hints that we can't even read.
Paimon: Buildings means people... once upon a time, anyway. And where there's people, there'll be writing!
Paimon: Huh, so there really was a path here. Enkanomiya is such a mysterious place.
Paimon: Let's have a look around. From what we've experienced in the past, we'll probably need to do something else first.
Paimon: Looks like our goal is that place in the middle.
Paimon: Looks like this is where we need to use the Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep.
Paimon: Phew, it sure took a while before we saw anything resembling civilization. Let's get closer and have a look.
Paimon: Seems like there's something else visible through this door. Is it a path? Or is it a trap that'll make us bump into a wall?
Paimon: The five symbols on this big door must be the Key Sigils.
Paimon: Those ruins seem to be closer to us. Let's start there!
Paimon: Wow! Paimon never thought that there'd be such a huge place underneath Watatsumi Island!
