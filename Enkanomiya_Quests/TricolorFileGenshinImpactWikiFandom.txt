???: In any case, I'm on Sangonomiya's side. It's better that these records remain forever buried here in the darkness.
Paimon: Experimental records?
???: What? You're not here to retrieve them? Then leave.
???: But that said, no ordinary person should have been able to enter this place. Are you a Jibashiri? Or were you sent here by Sangonomiya to silence us?
Paimon: No, no! We're just...
 Well, aren't you the bright spark?
???: What do you mean?
 We're here to watch you work.
???: Hmph...
 We're here to check on the measures you've taken to ensure the security of the records.
???: ...Whatever the case, your ability to get here indicates that you are no ordinary person. But I don't care whose side you're on. Leave this place — better sooner than later.
???: I've placed the records deep within the site, and the way can only be opened by activating an elemental monument. That will require a large amount of elemental energy.
???: Once everyone leaves Byakuyakoku, the Bathysmal Vishaps will be let loose. These have been raised to react to a special kind of elemental energy.
???: The Bathysmal Vishaps here are all of an enhanced variety, and they have a very high chance of passing their unique traits on their offspring. In a few years, this place will be swarming with powerful Bathysmal Vishaps.
???: As such, the records shall be safe as can be.
 Wouldn't it be safer to just have the records burnt?
???: That was the option that I favored, but our research team is split, and it's not as if I don't understand the other perspectives.
???: "We're saving Watatsumi! We're heroes!" "Agh, we're going to be the villains in this story, aren't we..." Both these views have merit.
???: And besides, leaving the truth to a generation that can forgive us for what we've done... That is an option that I can also accept.

???: On such nights, Enkanomiya is filled with afterimages... Of the "past," of "records," of "history" and the like...
???: They are unnecessary... and dangerous.
Paimon: (This guy doesn't seem to realize that he's an afterimage himself.)
Paimon: We're not here to retrieve any records.
???: Oh, is that so? Then leave, please.
???: Wait... No ordinary person should have been able to enter this place. Are you a Jibashiri? Or were you sent here by Sangonomiya to silence us?
Paimon: No, no! We're just...
 We're here to take stock.
???: Hmph. What is that, some kind of code that I didn't get the memo for? Still, it matters not. If you managed to get here, then I doubt I can stop you from doing as you please.
Paimon: Hah! I mean, look, today is Enkanomiya's final day. I suppose it couldn't hurt to estimate the number of people we'll need to do the moving around here a little early.
???: So yes, do as you like. Just make sure you don't light the elemental monument.
???: Once everyone leaves Byakuyakoku, I will let the Bathysmal Vishaps loose. They have been raised to react to a special kind of elemental energy.
???: The Bathysmal Vishaps here are all of an enhanced variety, and they have a very high chance of passing their unique traits on their offspring. In a few years, this place will be swarming with powerful Bathysmal Vishaps.
???: They are still locked up at the moment, but the ruckus they'll make if they sense that elemental power will be quite the headache for me.
Paimon: What are those for?
???: For recording the experiments, of course? By the way, there are probably some odd materials over there. Not anything you'll need to bring along, so don't worry about them.
 Quest DescriptionMichiya must have a reason for not giving the records up. You decide to investigate further...

???: Hmph. This is the third group of people you've sent here on Enkanomiya's last day.
???: Hmph. What is that, some kind of code that I didn't get the memo for? Still, it matters not. If you managed to get here, then I doubt I can stop you from doing as you please.

???: I've placed the records deep within the site, and the way can only be opened by activating an elemental monument. That will require a large amount of elemental energy.
???: If you want to collect the experimental records, then I have nothing to say to you. Perhaps if you can convince the Erebos and Sangonomiya Factions to cease their squabbling, we may yet discuss this.
???: In any case, I'm on Sangonomiya's side. It's better that these records remain forever buried here in the darkness.
???: Looking at you, you must either be a Jibashiri or one of Sangonomiya's retainers.

Michiya: As for the rest? Hmph. I shall not say.
Michiya: Mmhmm... Although I'll probably have to change my name once we get up above the surface to start a new life. Still, our wrongdoings are not so easily wiped away.
Michiya: Tell the higher-ups this: that Michiya will remain in the restricted zone until the moment of departure comes to ensure that no one else approaches the area.
Paimon: (This guy doesn't seem to realize that he's an afterimage himself.)
Paimon: Experimental records?
Paimon: Hah! I mean, look, today is Enkanomiya's final day. I suppose it couldn't hurt to estimate the number of people we'll need to do the moving around here a little early.
Paimon: No, no! We're just...
Paimon: So that makes you Michiya, then?
Paimon: The monument will summon dangerous Bathysmal Vishaps, though, so we should prepare ourselves first!
Paimon: We're not here to retrieve any records.
Paimon: What are those for?
Paimon: What was he talking about just now, anyway? Something about lighting the elemental monuments up to obtain the records.
Paimon: You've gotten better at pulling the wool over someone's eyes again, huh?
