 See you.
Kurai: See you. If you know how, please help me solve this electric ball problem.
 What do you need solved?
Kurai: Well, the issue of those Electro Cells, of course.
Kurai: Between you and me, I have no idea what to do with them.
Kurai: Vishaps and villains, I can master, but these little gadgets are way beyond me.
Kurai: How am I supposed to stop them from moving?
 What problem is that?
Kurai: Ah, yes, when I went to Narukami Island to conduct an exchange previously, I used a secret technique to capture some strange objects.
Kurai: I think the academic name for it is an Electro Seele. Or something.
Kurai: They fly all over the place, and numb all the people living here. It's quite vexing...

Media:vo eqyx002 1 paimon 03.ogg Paimon: Okay, we're ready to roll! Um, but how do we get the towers to link up? Let's look for clues nearby.
Media:vo eqyx002 1 paimon 04.ogg Paimon: Hey, this pattern seems to match the one on the tower. Could it be relevant?
Media:vo eqyx002 2 paimon 01.ogg Paimon: All set. Now we can climb on up.
